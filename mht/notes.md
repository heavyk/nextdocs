# the most holy trinosophia

I downloaded this book because it's said to have been written by st-germain. I read some of it while I was in starbucks and found the book to be complete nonsense.

I opened it up again just now (for an unknown reason), and I realised that I had been reading the extensive commentary on the document at the end. I don't find the commentary to be very interesting -- mostly buzzwords, and I think he's missing a lot of the symbols.

previously, I only skimmed the book and found it to be too visual for me to follow (especially in starbucks with so much activity). I got lost in all of the weird hebrew letters and stuff. those things may actually be a distraction -- like a magician's scarf -- cause here at home, in some of the visual language leading up to see some symbols jump out at me. these are my notes of them.

if you want to see the images, I refer you to the [source material](mht/most-holy-trinosophia.pdf).

### general notes


### section-1 notes

he seems to be addressing this to someone from a dungeon. it is perhaps an allegory. the person he is writing to is, "Philochatus". philo means "liker of" and "chatus" either refers to someone who likes to engage in light conversation, or a wine grape from france. since the document is in french, I would venture to imagine it to be the latter.

there are two major failures:
- indescretion, the imperious craving to inspire astonishment and admiration.
- the misuse of the power that God has intrusted to you.

so he's talking about using the power that this enlightenment process will bring to make power-displays:

> Both are born of the same mother, both owe their existence to pride. [...] these two Monsters carry their foul breath even into the hearts of the Lordâ€™s Elect. Woe unto him who misuses the gifts of heaven in order to serve his passions.

the writer seems to make an illusion that he once had quite a promanent position on earth but it fell apart because of the vanity of indescretion (the imperious craving to inspire astonishment and admiration -- power-displays):

> I, too, have known happiness, was showered with the blessings of heaven and surrounded by power such as the human mind cannot conceive. Commanding the genii that guide the world, happy in the happiness that I created, I enjoyed within the bosom of an adored family the felicity which the Eternal accords to His beloved children. One moment destroyed everything. I spoke, and it all vanished like a cloud.

his most certain words about this remind me of the name my father gave me. he said, I have two parts: fair in the sight of God and, fair in the sight of man. he explained that my lifelong struggle will be to look for fairness in the sight of man (rather than God). this, my father said, was the stumbling block of pride... though in such strange words, it reminds me a lot of my father:

> Let no vain desire to shine before men bring you, too, to disaster

the writer is very concerned about his appearance, saying that the most humiliating thing they did is defame his name. bad appearance is like torture to the writer:

> my oppressors, to torture me further have devised still surer, still more revolting means. They have brought infamy on my head, have made my name a thing of disgrace. The children of men recoil in terror when by chance they approach the walls of my prison; they fear lest some deadly vapour escape through the narrow slit that reluctantly admits a ray of light to my cell. That, O Philochatus, is the cruelest of all blows that they could bear down upon me.

he concludes with a very cryptic message saying that the receiver of the message will lift the veil that the hand of the creator has placed on the *sphinx*!! presumably, the one in egypt between the three pyramids...

> Remember only that all of it is to serve you ... an obscure line, an omitted character would prevent your lifting the veil which the hand of the Creator has placed over the Sphinx.
