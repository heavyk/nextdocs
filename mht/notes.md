# the most holy trinosophia

I downloaded this book because it's said to have been written by st-germain. I read some of it while I was in starbucks and found the book to be complete nonsense.

I opened it up again just now (for an unknown reason), and I realised that I had been reading the extensive commentary on the document at the end. I don't find the commentary to be very interesting -- mostly buzzwords, and I think he's missing a lot of the symbols.

previously, I only skimmed the book and found it to be too visual for me to follow (especially in starbucks with so much activity). I got lost in all of the weird hebrew letters and stuff. those things may actually be a distraction -- like a magician's scarf -- cause here at home, in some of the visual language leading up to see some symbols jump out at me. these are my notes of them.

if you want to see the images, I refer you to the [source material](mht/most-holy-trinosophia.pdf).

### general notes


### section-1 notes

he seems to be addressing this to someone from a dungeon. it is perhaps an allegory. the person he is writing to is, "Philochatus". philo means "liker of" and "chatus" either refers to someone who likes to engage in light conversation, or a wine grape from france. since the document is in french, I would venture to imagine it to be the latter.

there are two major failures:
- indescretion, the imperious craving to inspire astonishment and admiration.
- the misuse of the power that God has intrusted to you.

so he's talking about using the power that this enlightenment process will bring to make power-displays:

> Both are born of the same mother, both owe their existence to pride. [...] these two Monsters carry their foul breath even into the hearts of the Lordâ€™s Elect. Woe unto him who misuses the gifts of heaven in order to serve his passions.

the writer seems to make an illusion that he once had quite a promanent position on earth but it fell apart because of the vanity of indescretion (the imperious craving to inspire astonishment and admiration -- power-displays):

> I, too, have known happiness, was showered with the blessings of heaven and surrounded by power such as the human mind cannot conceive. Commanding the genii that guide the world, happy in the happiness that I created, I enjoyed within the bosom of an adored family the felicity which the Eternal accords to His beloved children. One moment destroyed everything. I spoke, and it all vanished like a cloud.

his most certain words about this remind me of the name my father gave me. he said, I have two parts: fair in the sight of God and, fair in the sight of man. he explained that my lifelong struggle will be to look for fairness in the sight of man (rather than God). this, my father said, was the stumbling block of pride... though in such strange words, it reminds me a lot of my father:

> Let no vain desire to shine before men bring you, too, to disaster

the writer is very concerned about his appearance, saying that the most humiliating thing they did is defame his name. bad appearance is like torture to the writer:

> my oppressors, to torture me further have devised still surer, still more revolting means. They have brought infamy on my head, have made my name a thing of disgrace. The children of men recoil in terror when by chance they approach the walls of my prison; they fear lest some deadly vapour escape through the narrow slit that reluctantly admits a ray of light to my cell. That, O Philochatus, is the cruelest of all blows that they could bear down upon me.

he concludes with a very cryptic message saying that the receiver of the message will lift the veil that the hand of the creator has placed on the *sphinx*!! -- presumably, the one in egypt between the three pyramids...

> Remember only that all of it is to serve you ... an obscure line, an omitted character would prevent your lifting the veil which the hand of the Creator has placed over the Sphinx.


### section-2 notes

he describes a room with four doors and a star in the middle:

```
          N
        black
  W   |------|    E
white | star |  blue
      |------|
          S
         red
```

the black one has a picture of a woman with just back draiperie over her knees and a two silver bands to

he goes first south to the red, but that slams shut. the next to the east (blue), but that makes a sound that he doesn't want to go. he finally goes to the white one. in it, he finds a white robe and clothes himself with it.

---

the first thing I thought about was the "root races", the first is the khemit (black root race) that had a matriarchical society. the next one is the red (atlantian), followed by the blue one (not sure which one that is), then finally the white one.

it also reminded me of noah's children. there was ham (black), shem (red), and japheth (white). these colours are reflected also in the egyptian hats they wear too, cairo and lower egypt being associated with red, the khemit culture being the predynasic black ones, and the blue coloured hat that was introduced with akhenaten. I believe these are race bloodlines.

the picture of the woman:

    On the north side was a painting representing a woman naked to the waist; a black drapery fell over her knees and two silver bands adorned her garment. In her hand was a rod which she placed against the forehead of a man facing her across a table which stood on a single support and bore a cup and a lance-head. A sudden flame rose from the ground and seemed to turn toward the man.

is also symbolic in that it's describing the woman (black) imparting something into the forehead (third eye, pineal) of the man. when this happens, a flame rises up from the ground. since we're talking about races and bloodlines, this must have been some sort of conflagration or purification symbol -- perhaps a destruction or cataclysm. I'm going to mentally associate it with the "baptism of fire"

the man is standing on something with a cup and lance-head. this reminded me of the tarot suits: cups and swords.

to me all of this symbolic imagery evokes a sort of transferrence of mental capacity from the woman into the man, and there are three other stations which are symbolic of the accessing of this mental capability.

the author is prevented from going in the (red) door, saying to me that the atlantean access point to that part of the mind is shut (probably insufficient energetic conditions on earth or even active prevention of nervous system, as in the angel with the flaming swords preventing reentry to the garden of eden)

next, he tries the (blue) (akhenaten's) door, and it doesn't close, but a sound which causes him to notice the star go toward the white door. he follows the white star instead.

in total this is telling me there is a shift in doorway whereby one must traverse to access this feminine imparted consciousness into the pineal chakra. (for the ones who know what I'm talking about, this makes perfect sense)

### section-3 notes

he walks up 9 stairs to a (white) marble platform with water all around it. this is probably a mental state that I'm not aware of. it gives me the impression that he should be frightened of it, but he sees the star plunge into the water so he just jumps in after it without even second-guessing.

if I were to relate this to personal experience, there is a moment that happens when star-watching that I get to where it feels like I go off into a great expanse. when I first started to experience it, it felt like I would lose control, and strangely enough I would often times return back to reality suddenly gasping for air as if I had been drowning in water or something.

an invisible hand places the lamp on the crown of his head. the lamp in other literature like the bible is the light in the spinal fluid. I'm reminded of zech 4 and rev 11. anyway, his "lamp" ascends all the way up to the crown of his head (eg. kundalini rises) and he struggles to make it through the other side. this remindes me of tereence's description of the "chrysanthemum" and how you have to push throgh it and get to the other side.

personally, I've always stopped it before it got too far, taking the advice of mantak chia of not wanting to go too fast. my experience tells me that if you push through you'll get a good feeling -- a "body orgasm", but if you instead let the energy lower down not needing the immediate manifestation -- continuing the technique over time, you will have eventually released enough resistance that it'll rise and go so fast such as to be effortless -- a "cosmic orgasm"

in this story, his effort to get to the other side causes a lot of heat and perspiration. that used to happen at first, but that's a sign of resistance. now, it happens so fast, it became too hard to stop.

as a result, he feels like he's going to die without illumination. a richly dressed man (he has money) with a golden crown on his forehead (he's enlightened) comes to rescue him saying, "come with me, with me, the foremost in the world; I will show thee the way thou must follow."

definitely a weird saying -- he's calling the author, "foremost in the world" and telling him he'll show the way. isn't the "foremost in the world" a title for the christ??

more astonishing is his response: "It is better to trust in the Lord than to sit among the mighty." -- which is basically like saying, "I'll find my own way, thanks". this is very opposite of most "occult" literature I've read which often emphasises following the ones that look to be enlightened, telling you where to go. so, even though he had a golden crown on his forehead, he figures he doesn't need the monarch's guidance. as a result, the boat and the monarch sank.

now, we're up on green sand (I don't know what bloodline is the green one) on the beach and there's a silver (white) wall:

```
         silver (white) wall
|----------------------------------|
|          (golden) crown          |
|     (red) lion | (black) lion    |
|       cloud    |   cloud         |
|  |-------|     -      |-------|  |
|  | (red) | / iron  \  | (red) |  |
|  | greek | \ ring  /  | sacred|  |
|  |-------|     -      |-------|  |
|                                  |
|                                  |
|----------------------------------|
           (green) sand
```

this to me is another map of consciousness. I would guess that the sacred text on the right is probably the subjective consciousness.

at the top of the wall is the golden crown -- this is enlightenment -- and guarding it are two lions, one (black) and the other (red).

between the subjective and objective consciousness is an iron ring. I'm not totally sure what that means, but I do know that if you're in one of those vortexes or magnetic anomalies where the faries and pixies show up, then a piece of iron will slow down the magnetic vibrations in the air (historesis) and will not allow the apparitions to manifest. therefore, this must be some sort of magnetic interference between the two hemispheres there that prevents the sides from becoming connected/synchronised.

I know in my own experience, this is definitely the case. I used to have quite a good "telepathic" connection between my lobes, but as nosebook started applying more and more prevention to allow the subjective and objective sides to communicate easily, I most of that communication is blocked, so therefore only the really high frequency stuff passes through.

[TODO: finish up here]

### born-again - being born again

both the surrounding water and having to push through (the chrysanthemum) to the other side are strongly reminescent of water baptism, or being "born again".

when a child is born, they have massive amounts of DMT in their head. it's basically like a very strong psychedellic trip of DMT or psilocybin (which hydrolyses into DMT). in those intense trips, the experience is so abstract and I experienced so much of a feeling of "love" ... in those states, you ratiate that pure unexplainable abstract energy of love and people I noted felt an unsual calmness around me. however, for me everything around me looks so unnatural and feels so foreign that it's difficult not to freak out. I beleive this very similar to a baby's experience after the first breath.

these psychedellic and near-death experiences return the person back to that state right after being born. thankfully, those states do not happen often, which is why they're only produced with strong drugs, moments where a person feels like they're about to die (like the author), or under extreme amounts of pain or pleasure.

it's often the case that when you get close to that stage, it feels like everything is going to die, go away, or something bad is going to happen. (this reminds me of child birth) the natural instinct is to try and push through it, and you can get through it, but if you have to push it's a sign of resistance. I've personally never pushed through it, so I can't tell you what happens, but the experiences others have related is that pushing through can lead to a very extraordinary experience, but I think each successive time of having to push through it, it develops more resistance to the experience (treence would say that the DMT orbs would tell him, "you recommend so many others to come but come yourself so little").

I really don't recommend pushing through. I recommend relaxing and just going along for the ride (this may be true in childbirth as well). in psychedelic experiences, it's the pushing too hard that causes the damage. if one just relaxes, knowing that it always works out, and just lets the sensation take over instead of fighting, the sensation felt is something to the effect of "giving in to dying" -- and, in that moment, my life passes before my eyes and I cross over to another space that I can't describe physically cause it has no dimensions, colour, space, or anything like that.

once I'm there, if I then try to use my eyes, the whole world looks strange -- I mean, it's the same world I always see (like my room or something), but it looks foreign and not easy to understand. physical reality is very difficult to understand, but it's there and it's fine. I know I'm probably not making any sense to anyone, so I often just listen to the music (if there is any) or create my own.

as reality starts to come back to becoming understandable again, I have a fresh new outlook on things.

for me, this is the being "born again" process. I've done it a few times and experienced simlar effects while star-watching.

the trick is knowing that it's going to be OK (it always is), and to just relax, cause it's all in my head anyway.
