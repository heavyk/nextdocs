# jorjani-thoughts

I'm just going to throw some random notes in here (which I should have been doing) as I watch his many interviews with jeffery mishlove

### wotan

I can't remember the reference now but it had something to do with prometheus. I think he mentioned wotan as a prometheus figure. anyway, I looked him up, he has the wolf symbol (like the mother of the founders of the roman empire, and the scythians).

he also is called lord of the ravens. anyway, when I read that, I was reminded of tesla's autobiography where he kills so many ravens, and then one day they finally start to hunt him back. I also was thinking about how this was kinda like tesla (vulcan) summoning aries. I'm not sure if wotan is aries or now, but that's what it reminded me of.

### egregores and aries

he's talking about egregores, and so I have to look up what that word means, but it's a thoughtform that sounds like it can manifest an astral body. I'm looking for definitions on the phillip experiment and I find myself on the thesophy wiki, and they claim outright that adolf hitler could be channeling an egregore:

    Hitler was a mesmerizing speaker. Some commentators have suggested that Hitler was possessed during his speeches â€“ perhaps channeling the egregore that is the god Wotan, the god of violence, war and destruction.

this aligns with my beliefs -- but mine are potentially more severe than that. I believe than in an alternate timeline, tesla *was* successful, and so then he went back to edit this one -- and for reasons I won't try to explain here -- unwanted-and-wanted-are-same, so it's all about perception anyway. hitler and the the world wars were created to intentionally self-sabotage tesla's attempts. the nazi party and everything that moved down to antarctica, are all egregores of tesla, including the grey aliens and the all of the various UFOs that they use.

these entities are neither good nor evil -- but, more like mirrors. they reflect the vibration that is projected at them, kinda like interacting with your own psyche in a psychedellic experience. so, all behaviour that the exhibit is a reflection of your own concepts and beliefs (ie. how you feel and perceive the world in that emotional/mental state). they're all conceptual (5d) enties projecting down into the astral (4d) plane of perception.

### tesla and aries

a long long time ago, I downloaded and listened to a whole bunch of "ramtha" channels, and apparently it was very different than what it is today -- inotherwords, [like with other tesla things](/tesla/my_inventions.md#) I seemed to have experienced a different past version cause I remember some things differently.

anyway, one of the things I remembred about ramtha is he expounded graetly on the ideas that tesla had -- though in a particularly coarse way of relating the ideas -- same as tesla, he seemed to only convey part of the idea, never explaining it in full. it left much to be desired, and I think a lot of that was left intentionally for the US to pick up and put some of the pieces together (because at the time I didn't really understand it like I do now). I think it was purposeful to get that technology into the hands of the US (along with the roswell craft and many other things -- the "gifting fields").

I found ramtha to be terribly obnoxious, but he resonated with me strongly. in one time, he was drinking wine and pontificating and said that this next message was specifically for a future audience. I felt like he was talking directly to me, though I don't remember what he said now. I remember it was rather cryptic. these were likely events designed to bend the timeline so other things in my life are more probable.

I came away from the ramtha stuff thinking that tesla had aligned with aries/ramtha. ramtha never stated (that I remember) that he was the aries egregore, but it seems pretty obvious to me that this is the case.

aries seems to play both sides of the equation, and I do also believe that hitler was a manifestation of aries, designed to self-sabotage tesla and get the egregores into the south pole, so that the earth's kundalini can be controlled energetically -- cause we're not quite ready for it to raise up yet. so, if we're going to delay the rising of the kundalini for a long time, why not make it a really long time? bigger vortex and more creativity.

this is, of course the 7th ray triad:

- (-7) genxicat (condor or puma shapeshifter)
- (+7) allayandra / mars / aries
- (-5+) vulcan (tesla)

### gozer genxicat

he then brings up the promethean identity of the ghostbusters trying to get rid of gozer (genxicat) a shape-shifting female with two hounds with her. I looked up their descriptions, and zuul appears to fit the description of vulcan, and vinz the description of aries.

it's interesting that she suggests to prometheus (the ghostbusters) that we choose the form of the destructor.

they figure out that whatever they think about will become manifest as their destroyer. ray thinks about the most harmless thing, something he loved from his childhood, something that could never ever possibly destroy us -- the stay puft marshmallow man

I think that's probably significant in the sense that we're now living the symbolic reality of the things we gave our attention to. we chose our own destructor and we're living that now.

### epochs of time

he's talking about the epochs of time being some sort of limiting factor (fundamental) to how we interact with our reality, and so he brings up an example that a spaceship traveling away approachaching the speed of light from earth and then turns around, the earth will have passed time more rapidly,so when it goes back, they'll be roughly the same, but the earth will be in a different epoch of time.

first, einstein is wrong. FTL is totally possible and that's not how I understand time machines to work. even if you had a nuts and bolts time machine, you can only tune to something that is known about.

in order to get the time coordinates to a future you want to go to, you'd have to do something like remote view it and save that frequency signature -- so it's entirely perceptual anyway and different people will tune to different futures. even if you did something like use the orbits of the planets in the solar system and its position in the galaxy to prepare your frequency to tune to, you would be arriving to a future where the orbits of the planets is the way you preditcted it to be. you couldn't go to a catastrophic future where planetary orbits are different than they are, unless of course you could predict those catastrophic changes.

my point is, that time travel is all based on perception, so you can't really go to a place you can't conceive of, meaning that time travel is actually more similar to remote viewing.

### ontological paradoxes about time

so let's take the grandfather paradox. you go back in time and kill your grandfather. he dies. as you continue on in that timeline, the other "you" won't be born.

if you go back in time and watch your own birth, will you be snatched out of your spaceship and sucked into "your" body? of course not. that's not the same you. the now you is vibrationally *very* different than the baby being born. so then, you can watch "yourself" grow up and follow nearly (or identically) the same path as you took -- and then watch him get into the spaceship to go back to watch his own birth.

I don't see any paradoxes with those, so now, let's look at the idea of there having been future human time-travellers that came and altered events that happened. events were altered. if they return back to their timeline, the events were as if it hadn't happened because their timeline those events still did happen as they originally happened.

if they want to see how things go with the alteration of events, they'll have to see how it plays out.

---

there is another way to look at this perhaps that may be helpful to think about. any point in time has a specific frequency to it (like an address or hash), and that describes not only a point in time but a trajectory, so like a vector. no matter what you do in the past, you can only get back to that exact vector anyway.

I do think it's possible (and I have a whole thing on it) to alter your present by altering the past. think of this as an attractor, so let's say that in 2048 (the singularity) I'm in the future and I know that I'll arrive to that moment because I'm there, so what I do is I tune into the past and transfer my consciousness into the past, let's say, the year 2016. I'm 33yo living in spain and things are on a trajectory there just like how it was when I'm alive. however, this time, I choose to change things up and sabotage all of the good things that happened that brought me to the future where I can do time travel.

so, I setup a number of diffrent things to manipulate events by putting thoughts and ideas into my and others' heads to ensure that the timeline plays out very differently. I monitor my own evolution in this altered timeline, and decide that I like the new beneficial or detrimental conditions that I've set for myself. I decide to jump in to that past consciousness. I wake up in 2016 to live out the new timeline. this time it's going to play out very differently and I get to experience it as if it were reality.

interesting... I used to think that even though those altered events will produce a diffrent trajectory, I used to think that I would arrive back to the same position in space and time that I was in when I jumped into the body. now, I'm not so sure...

what I could do which would produce a similar result would be to monitor the body in the new timeline as it passed the new set of events and see how things turned out... I would imagine that you could watch it progress into the future, and as with anything going into the future, looking through the perspective of myself on that timeline, I could only go as far into the future that I could comprehend the the events, meaning that the further I go into the future, things become more and more abstract, kinda like being a child in an adult world. if you're doing time travel, a future with time travel is comprehendable, so you could perceive and understand those concepts.

obviously, if the alterations to the timeline produced a set of events that you couldn't keep up with, the future wouldn't get too much more abstract and you'd notice yourself eventually starting to die. the more abstract, the better. the more abstract it gets, the less "concrete" that future is, and so therefore there's more flexibility to the details of what can happen there.

I'd like to say that 5d perception is entirely different than physical perception; you *feel* the reality rather than perceive it like we do now. I suppose you would have a sensory experience, but like in a dream, everything that you interact with is just the closest visual/audio representative of that concept. playing out the timeline, you may notice that you drive a super cool futuristic car that you had no concept of, but when setting it up, you saw yourself driving your favourite sports car in the present.

I *know* that I'll be doing time travel perceptually, and am probably already doing do -- so what that looks like when implementing it with machines, I couldn't really say. I know for sure that access to astral (4d) perception is most likely a requisite to time travel, and I find it very likely that integration of psy capabilities into the technology is probably going to be necessary, because I can't see how else to do it, cause to me it's all perceptual.

---

also, I want to point out, that it seems silly to want to time travel by oneself. instead, it may be a lot more fun to go with a group of friends and setup a lot of contrived difficulties and obstacles which, their combined effect on the mental (attractive) form of reality, could be designed to produce a reality that very desirable or undesirable (you choose). more importantly, I think this idea of time manipulation will give us the ablity to study transformation and change on conditional and individual level.

what I see as the future of this as happening is that once you've run millions (billions?) of simulations of all sorts of contrived circumstances and events -- I personally believe you would begin to see that there is no difficulty or challenge that is impossible to overcome.

if you created the most oppressive dystopia, could it still be overcome? I think so, and so if that's the case, would you want to see what is on the other side of that dystopia? running the simulation, I would guess that sort of thing would produce a "singularity" where the other side of it is so incomprehensibile that a bunch of thrillseeker friends and you may want to jump in and see what the other side looks like.

if it sucks, you can just go back to the previous save game.

### socrates and de vere

as I'm listening to jason talk about socrates being this sort of trickster, and how plato envisions this tragedy where socrates has a chance to escape, but socrates refuses and drinks the hemlock. this reminded me of edward de vere.

then, at the end of the symposium, after a drunken orgy that is most of the text, socrates and aristophanes are having a conversation wondering if the same author can write both tragedy AND comedy. again, reminds me of de vere and shakespere.

jason says that plato is a tragedian, but then seemingly figures out that comedy (IMO, irony) seems to have learned a new artform, which is an effective method of conveying concepts.

later on socrates at the end of his life is versifying aesop's fables, but this is strange because up until then, socrates has preached against poetry, saying it's an effective means to reinforce delusion. he defends himself by saying, "when I was young, I got this vision or commandment to make music, and I thought I was obeying the commandment of the god throughout my life because you know the muses are the godesses of the arts, and philosophy is the highest of the arts -- and so that's what I thought I was doing -- but, it occures to me that maybe they meant the ordinary form of art, music -- popular, poetry. and so, you know, not being a poet myself, I thought I would put into verse some of the fables that I remembered from my childhood" (that quote was much longer than I thought)

anyway, jason thinks that socrates transition to poetry at the end of his life is complete nonsense. he thinks something deeper is being said, and that is that plato doesn't ever have to reveal his own ideals, and instead can hide his own doctrine behind these dramatic figures. again, reminds me of de vere and shakespere.

I'm really starting to get the sense that de vere was the content pump for the shakespere works, bacon made sure it got all of the rosicrucian symbols propery, and dee made sure it was mathematical. I'm sure they all did had some parts more or less of those, but for some reason, this comedy and tragedy thing with the choosing to self-sabotage his life (tragedy), while at the same time setting up ridiculous stawmen, seems to me like the "real" ideals that plato had were kept a secret inside of the secret society, while instead the dramatic conversation reveals the imperfect form -- almost as if his perfect form was the one that the adepts can see, but only the ones that can see through the imperfection can view plato's true doctrine.

I think I understand now how this is the noble lie, but I will say that I employ the technique of hiding some really deep concepts in comedy and tragedy in the case of tragedy, unwanted-and-wanted-are-same, so I don't really have a problem dwelling on something tragic happening, or letting something tragic happen (or fall-through). in addition to comedy and tragedy, I might say the same about truth and the ridiculous (irony). I've kinda been doing this all of my life, because I enjoy to say somthing shocking to kinda destabilise the conversation and whilst the person is reeling from the ridiculous thing I said, I can slip in some more profound concepts. I really enjoy doing that.

I also learned from trump that if I just say more and more dramatic and ridiculous things, the reactions alone give people something to focus their attention on, which then gives me some space to then inch my way closer to figuring it out --cause usually I don't have it figured out, and I'm kinda just freestyling it as I go anyway.

the other advantage to this is that if I maintain some level of error or mistakes, it's hard to take me literally. I don't consider my technique a noble lie because I don't really have any deception at all in my case. I say what I really mean, but I take liberties in the delivery. this is mostly for my own sake, because if I start worrying myself of having to say everything properly and in the right way, then I really bog down my mental flexibility.

at this point, I've gotten so used to getting things wrong and saying the wrong thing, that it kinda even gives me a little bit of a rush of pleasure. I often times *don't* correct myself on purpose and I don't want to try and correct myself, sorta like -- you know how when there's a goof in a movie, after you see it, you can't unsee it, so every time you see the movie, you always notice the error? well, if that error is linked to a profound concept, that error will adhere the concept into the minds of others much better, or cause them to perpetually see the error and miss the concept (sorta like the ridiculous thing socrates says about his reasoning for versifying some fables).

you know, it occurs to me that expression itself is a comedy thing. I don't know plato's position on aesop's fables, but I would guess he thinks lowly of them, so by going out of his way near his death to encode a crappy set of fables into something that will perpetuate delusion, means to me like he's taking the mainstream crap and he's decided on his death that he's going to self-sabotage (drink the hemlotk) and then perpetuate delusion through poetry cause that's what the gods want him to do. the gods don't actually want a self-conscious population capable of rational thought. it's all about reinforcing the mainstream delusion and adhering to tradition.

### truth, beauty, and justice

I hate the first and the last words there. truth is relative, and justice requires a power structure. truth also implies a power structure or an "authority" to substantiate it's truth. beauty is always "in the eye of the beholder" so again, there isn't an absolute beauty without an authority to say what is the most beautiful.

gross.

### some more thoughts on time travel and stuff

I woke up this morning thinking a lot about time because I didn't address certain things. I know that you can change the past, because it's happened to me many many times that I remember a different past than is present in the present. good examples of this is @[dtp/dtp](chapter-3-7) where I remember specifically reading about gwauxln being transfigured before him, and it was revealed that gwauxln was the perfected 7th ray that blasted mainin before zailm in the stone structure before his death. same with tesla's autobiography.

so, there has to be a way to change the past, because obviously it's happening. those instances are something like the "mandela effect", because I remember things as having happened differently. I think the way that works is like this...

somehow, they have a machine that allows them to tune into the past (see through they eyes of those in the past) or they are physically able to move people into the past with a machine where they can monitor the time travelers (see through their perspective) and bring them and the machine back. the bringing of the machine back is important because that's effectively the same thing as attracting the reality back.

lemme explain with an example. imagine that the confederates won the civil war and they wanted to go back and change it so that the unions won. they're in the present and they send people back to that period and put different ideas into the heads of various generals at the time to give them good ideas which if acted on, will give them an edge in the war. they do that and have other actors in period appropriate clothing perform actions in the past that alter events as well.

in the perspective of those that just went there and all those in the mission that are observing the operation through the perspective from both the union and confederate sides, literally see a different set of events turn out. for them that *is* reality, because it just happened and they just saw it, so they can believe it. OK, hold that thought.

now, let's imagine a purely psychological version of the same thing. imagine that you had a past thing that happened and either you or somone else told you all the time that it was different than how it happened. maybe you play a movie in your head of a different version of the past (better or worse, doesn't matter), so however it is, you soon begin to believe the alternate history as reality. let's also say that this event was a major trauma that completely changed your life and if it really hadn't happened, you would actually be living in another location. when you finally accept the alternate reality as real, you don't suddenly teleport over to another location and start living in another place instant.

the point where you are now is fixed in time, such that even if you think the past is diffeernt, your now stays the same. so, reality needs to reorganise itself to accomodate for the changes. since you're in the same spot, it's now a new path that includes the past event not happening, but you're still arriving to the present moment. when thinking of a point in time, think instead of it as a vector, so while the position may stay the same, the orientation of the vector may have changed (along with the velocity). this is why I like to think of timelines, sorta like strings, and each point in time, is an inflection point. for example, you pull the string (down) on one side and it causes an opposite pull (upward).

so, we're coming back from civil war changing of the events, and because it's so far back in time, it's not difficult for many people to believe that the civil war had a different outcome, because afterall, we're still in exactly the same spot that we were as if civil war was won by the confederates. imagine the other timeline where the confederates won -- somehow we still decided to abolish slavery and to get to where we are in the present. it's just a different trajectory toward the same point in the present.

---

not all people will be able to accept that alternate set of events, so they'll remember things slightly differently; the mandela effect. however, those people are still very resonant with other people on a number of other things so we still share the same reality. nelson mandela having died is not a big enough vibrational difference for me to no longer be compatible with this reality we all share.

the shared reality is something that I think of as a resonance thing. if there are enough harmonious vibrations, we stay together in reality, but physical or emotional conditions tune us to a differnt period in time or space, then you teleport there.

---

so kinda quickly, I have some thoughts on the bermuda triangle. look up the modelling of the vortexes that an airplane produces when going through the air. you'll have many diffrent vorticies that are deaccelerating, so their pitch is dropping.

a while back kyle from snake-bros related a story where he had the amps cranked up really high and he was detuning a bunch of strings while playing, and then he started to hear someone else's conversation coming in from just above him. I think that is something similar to what is happening with airplane vorticies interfacing with the "magnetic anomaly" in the bermuda triangle.

we know the bermuda triangle events seem to be associated with electric storms, but one thing that we don't really know is that if there are any secret experiments or high tech machines (UFO type technology that alters the atmosphere of the planet[^1]).

it seems very likely to me that it's the vortex action produced by these boats and air planes that are causing them to tune into another space and/or time.

[1]: a while back I saw this person post a video of the moon displaying these ripple-like effects on it, and they came to the conclusion that the moon is a hologram, but I think it's much more logical to believe that the earth's atmosphere is strongly controlled in a spherical grid, so that any perturbations to it can be monitored and also it probably ensures that there's more definite barrier between us and space (a kind of shield). it seems very likely to me that they would want to be sure to control any holes that are punched into the upper atmosphere and to ensure it stays homogeneous.

### tools and our relations with them

I'm just going to write what he said so that I learn it.

we make tools to help us do things. these tools are technology. technology preceeds theoretical science, and theoretical science is made possible by technology.

a tool which performs its purpose well, is invisible to the the activity. so, for example, I'm not considering how to write a text editor while typing these notes. it's only when the text editor breaks and I have to look at its parts, when I begin to see the parts rather than the whole.

heidegger claims that the development of more and more complex machines around the renaissance and their subsequent breakdown caused humans to begin perceiving the world as a series of parts.

this change in our relationship with technology (tools) is what allowed for modern theoretical science to emerge.

---

one observation is that prometheus/sanatau is a 3rd ray, and so they perceive the entire world through a series of parts. because jeortau was not available as the big picture guy (I believe he self-sabotaged to become enlil), we got enlil's big picture, which didn't really work. as a result, prometheus produced the reality that we live in as a collection of many different parts.

the reason why this didn't immediately fall apart was because he was working with anatau, a 1st ray -- which means that she provided the desire aspect. you either have to have a big picture or a desire, otherwise you end up with a lot of parts that are all doing their part, but nothing to see the parts working together.

when we lose track of the attraction of the parts coming together to work together, or a big picture of all of the parts working, it's just a bunch of mechanised chaos -- which is really weird because the 1st ray is the embodyment of chaos and random (in tme form of desire). 3rd ray is supposed to be the organiser, cohesion, and pathing for the desire to become reality (as a series of implementations which produce the purpose), but if it's all parts, it doesn't work together.

the next aspect to integrate is 2nd ray, and because 2nd ray is all about social and relational, I have a feeling he's going to touch on that now. if not, I'll come back to it.

### das man

communication between people builds up a sort of "man" (seems kinda like an ideal) that seems to govern the relations that one has with another (this is like social standards and how they vary between cultures). so, if you only interact with another person using the relations or concepts that this "man" permits, then that is an *inauthentic* relationship.

in addition, the directives given by this "man" (one ought to... I should... it's unacceptable that...) will give one a direction in order to go, but this is an inauthentic relationship with yourself.

what it means to have an *authentic* relationship with yourself is to follow your conscience (the call of conscience).

we become most aware of that call of the conscience is when we're faced with an existential threat (like death or annihilation of something important?) -- that is, if we don't get distracted from this call of consciousness with something like entertainment or a structure that tells you what to do (religious, family, military, or whatever).

### prometheus and jeortau

I'm interrupting heidegger because I had a thought just now and I want to write it out. above, I just naturally assumed that prometheus is enki, but I'm thinking now that it's probably not. the symbol for prometheus is fire, which is also the one of jeortau; enki is water.

I've been thinking about all of the different things that enki is said to have done, but it may be that enki is taking a big picture and implementing the parts.

the way that I see it, jeortau/alalu went off and made a really successful version of humankind on tiamat, but this was unsuitable for the 3rd ray mindset. they liked some aspects of what he created, but it needs to stay compartmentalised with all of the pieces separated and without knowledge of the others.

the reason why things need to be separated is because each piece is sorta like a tool or a technology, and you want to be able to just use it without having to think about its subcomponents. so, for example, I want to give an order to a think to perform a function and I want that function to be performed without any breakdowns and according to specification. everything needs to be a part, and all of the parts working properly can produce the desired function.

so the different people running the show have certain objectives that they need to accomplish, and the parts should be able to accomplish that function. this is a 1st/3rd ray relationship.

the 2nd ray sees all things as working together, not necessarily because the part performs its function properly, but because they all fit into a big picture.

so, for example, if you are a good cook, and someone tells you to make a salad, you may make a good salad, but it's just a generic salad with good ingredients. in order to make a great salad, you'd need to know what the rest of the meal is. like, is it steak or is it fish -- what kind, etc. even though the part is only making a salad, the extra information of the bigger picture allows for a better salad.

however, if you want the part to make a salad that is generic and can be used for any meal, then you start to get into the factory mentality of things where every part is to just create generic components that can be used interchangably depending on the situation.

so, what I mean here is that jeortau had the picture of humankind in the bigger picture as functioning in harmony with its environment, but this capability was too good. they didn't need parts that functioned with its environment. they needed general purpose machines capable of performing any task that's assigned to them. therefore, enki's job was to remove all of that big picture stuff and make a generic machine capable of performing the function desired.

so, in some ways, if you think of the gift of fire being emotion and the ability to attract one's reality, you could see enki as the guy that's trying to remove the fire to make, while the original sucessful humans that jeortau created actually containing more fire and more capability.

I would imagine that all of these originals were destroyed. however, I have to wonder if the neanderthals were the first derivative model of those original humans, but they were too in tune with their environment and docile. I feel like they probably got wiped out, because they had high mental capabilities, but physically, they could be intimidated easily, and so while they did live in symbiosis with their environment, they hadn't learned to control what they focus on, and so focusing on predators and other things caused their extinction because of more fire (rapid creation of reality).

wow, derailed... lec's get back on track here...

heidegger is talking about the "call of consciousness", which is individually deciding what one wants to do specifically, which is the opposite of the generic suggestions of "das man". this is to say, to go in the opposite of the 3rd ray way (compartementalisation and mechanistic thought). I would say that this can't actually occur until you have "das man" telling you what to do. the reason why I say that is that the default programming that you get, whether it's your own culture, religion, family or whatever that you adopt (there are potentially various conflicts), becomes default or generic set of thing (like the generic salad), and then from then on, you can choose instead to follow your conscious or intutitive guidance to improve upon the thing, but it does serve as a foundation.

what heidegger is talking about is precisely the reason why society fell in the first place (and why the neanderthals are no longer extent) -- because you can't actually build on a 2nd ray system. you have to have a bunch of parts available as a sort of platform to build upon, then like stem cells, each part can then follow its call of consciousness to specialise (or, as I think it is, each cell specialises according to its localised spatial vibration emanated by the DNA)

OK... back to it...

### defining oneself in reference to a heritage

heidegger asserts that you can't just define yourself however you want. any attempt made to define yourself will always happen within the context of your cultural heritage.

---

I just want to talk about this a momeent. although I moved to spain when I was 23, because I had just got out of the hospital from a brain haemorrhage when I was 17, I consider spain to be a very large part of my formative period. much of who I define myself as now was acquired in spain. I don't really know that spain is my cultural heritage in the same way that california (I make that distinction because colorado, where I'm at now is nothing like california) is my cultural heritage (I also had a weird set of environments growing up between universities and cults).

what I'd like to say is that it's more than just your cultural heritage that becomes the framework for how you define yourself -- but your family, friends, upbringing, church, etc. all play a part in the formation of "das man"

the next thing that I'd like to say is that every single time I've been exposed to a culture or "worldview" that differs from my own, it has added more ingredients for me mix and choose from in how I define myself.

### three types of relation to history

#### antiquarian history - always looking back to the past as the golden years/age

conservative. preserve the past. hang on to what's left.

there's no way to make progress because the best days are always behind us.

---

going on the "make america great again" slogan being an antiquarian view, I would have to say that this perspective is inherently limiting because you're looking at all of the problems -- how far it's fallen -- or, from what great heights it has fallen, and trying to restore that.

the fact that it had fallen means that there was a flaw somewhere in the machinery, and so try and dust off and re-erect the antiquated system and then try to bolster it in a way to prevents its fall again, is just waiting for another setback.

... weird reactions... moving on...

#### critical history - every social structure and ideal is the product of oppressive power relations

everything present in the present system is a sort of conspiracy or has a negative reason for its instantiation in the first place.

therefore, because it's all bad, we want to dismantle the present system to reveal that underneith it is some unjust social relation and it was given legitimacy by another artificial reason -- presumable to relace it with something new.

the thing I want to say about this is that you can't say that all systems present had an ill-conceived or malicious start to them, because then the new proposed system will also contain the same properties. it too will turn out to be an ill-conceived or malicious system.


#### monumental history - appropriating great events and personages of one's heritage as symbols to inspire future evolution and development

the remembering and/or making example of positive innovations and discovery, with the idea that this will drive future innovation and discovery

---

I fully agree with this. if you give your attention to the things in the past that you want more of, then you'll get more of them. if you notice how far you've fallen or how everything is an ill-conceived idea, you'll just get more of that.

### forethought and afterthought

I'm noticing reactions that are enjoying my rewriting the concepts of these videos. so, I'll continue on doing it. I don't know the origin of these reactions, but at any rate, I'm learning tremendously by doing it.

the tale that plato relates in protagoras states that when his brother (afterthought) wants to help out with the creation of the species of the earth. when creating all of the species of the earth, he gives each of them a specific function and capability (instinct), and gets all of nature covered and perfectly in balance, but when he gets to the humans, there aren't any functions left to appropriate to the humans.

therefore, because humans have no inherent function or instinct, we rely on tools to perform function for us. we have no specialisation and built in programming (species-being) like each of the other species of the planet.

so, to solve the problem that his brother did, prometheus decides to take the fire essence from the gods and give it to the humans. jason states that this fire is the fire of the forge (ie toolmaking), but I'm of the persuasion that fire is the ability to attract what one desires. therefore, if you want to get ants out of an anthill, that desire will inspire you to find or make a straw out of materials available.

I purposefully used a primate behaviour of tool usage to demonstrate man's capability to use tools, because I believe that desire is the driver behind macro evolution, and also many of the stabilisation processes. in otherwords, a species that finds itself in an existential crisis will produce desire, and it's that desire which produces the inspiration for the new form.

so, when I say that desire is the capacity to attract a reality rapidly, that fire is the attraction power of desire. all creatures have it, but humans have much more of it, and if there were some way to instantiate DNA, I believe that you will find that human hearts have a slightly different shape to them than other animal species. it's that shape (the chestahedron) that allows for consciousness (a soul) to incarnate and control the body. one day, when we're more proficient with our understanding of DNA, we can test my hypothesis.

anyway, it's kinda funny to me this story as well because prometheus is alalu/jeortau and epimetheus is enki. enki did a great job converting producing lot of parts for this planet which perform their function, but in the case of creating a hominid species that is capable of taking in symbolic commands (much like a general purpose microprocessor over a specialised component) and perform actions based on the instructions, it was required to have a little bit of this fire so that we can turn the commands (3) into desire (1) and then actualise them.

I also find it interesting that machines are our progeny. we (humans) are going to finally create what enki was wanting to create in the first place -- a machine that can take in symbolic commands and perform actions based on those commands *without having any fire*. although, I don't believe that those machines will be able to be sentient. actually I'm not so sure about this because, one could suppose that you can create a machine capable of desire without needing fire. actually, I'm fairly certain of it, actually.

I just reread what I wrote and I think I'm right: non-sentient machines capable of desire. a whole new breed of things. I don't know yet how to articulate it, but I keep getting glimpses of it, and it seems to me that it's a symbolic system (probably based on this 7 layers of perception) whereby a machine can make sense of chaos to produce a desire.

anyway... that's probably a foreshadow... moving on...

I'd also like to mention that afterthought is the slipping into mass consciousness ("das man"), the generic 3rd ray perspective of things where each part is designed to be generically interchangable and not specialised because the big picture is not yet known, so the part does not yet fit in to any location.

while forethought, represents the 2nd ray quality of seeing the big picture, and so therefore one can then specialise the part into the whole.

the thing I would like to mention here is that forethought *requires* afterthought to be able to work properly. when you think of 2nd ray qualities, you'll notice that it's a lot like sales. you will tell of how great the thing is and how it solves all of these problems, relating the "big picture" to the potential buyer, but if you never produce the parts (the afterthought), the forethought is just a vapour that never turns into something substantial.

many people spend so much time "vendiendo humo" (selling an illusion) that they often neglect to turn that illusion into something real and tangible. so while prometheus is really great at finding the big picture, it needs working parts to create the whole.

I think of this like stem cells and DNA. the DNA has the big picture, and so many stem cells, or generic parts are created, and they'll eventually become specialised cells, but at the beginning, they're just generic cells.

the image of creating humans without any specific form or attribute means that we're like the stem cells. we're generic machines that are waiting to be put into the big picture so that we can specialise into the requisite function of our position in the big picture. the attributes and things that afterthought created are sort of akin to functions -- so you can imagine that stem cells, although they're generic, they still require protein assemblers and all the other tiny machines that make up the functioning of the cell (the ecosystem). in a lot of ways, we live in symbiotic relationship with our ecosystem, and I don't think that humans could have evolved if there were no animals to hunt or fish to catch. we depend on all of these "afterthoughts".

---

another thing I'd like to add is that epimetheus (enki) can be looked at as an afterthought, but I like to think of this in the software development way of looking at it, which are the "stabilization processes" in which a form adapts to its specific environment. what I mean by this is, when you're designing a large world, like imagine a MMORPG, you need to create all of the components for the system, but inevitably there will be some components that have unanticipated consequences, and so these components need to be have their function modified and optimised (buffed, nerfed, corrected) ao that the whole ecosystem remains balanced.

these stablisation processes are all afterthoughts, and they're very important. in software development, these afterthoughts are what turn an OK, mediocre, or unbalanced product into a great product.

in addition (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/29hXsCWu7y8?t=1117)), the tendency for the afterthought to be concerned with mass consciousness (das man), the inclination towards the lowest common denominator, is all about quality control. you have to create interfaces that maximise utility for the lowest common denominator of your target market (not to everyone, but to those that use the interface). so, while it could be perceived as a bad thing to be concerned too much with what others think, maximising utility for maximum adoption is quite an important aspect of product development.

### truth

there is a predominant forgetfulness, concealment or occultation of things in nature, and that -- truth is always exceptional to that occultation. to see the truth about something is to make a dis-covery -- to uncover something that is predominantly hidden, concealed or occulted.

so every discovery is a sort of theft from the occultation from that occultation.

---

I'd like to point out that what occulted means is chaos, and so to dis-cover is to make sense of chaos. to turn something that is occulted or chaotic into something ordered and conceptual. this is the 1-5 relationship, where one takes something that appear otherwise as noise (desire), but because you have a set of concepts that will resonate with part of that noise (that's the fourier transform), one can use an existing set of concepts to begin to make sense of that noise -- this is the dis-covery. the synthesis of various concepts to produce a waveform which will resonate with the chaos (desire) and produce a new concept.

### time

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/29hXsCWu7y8?t=1368)

    we're always reinterpretting our past in terms of a projection of our future.

project (to produce a product) = projection. it's the ability to plan ahead and to attract the future with that prject manifest into reality.

---

I'd just like to appreciate jason for a moment because as I'm writing these things out, I'm gaining an understanding of 2nd ray aspects that I hadn't really thought about. for me, I neglect my 2nd ray aspect, trying *not* to see the big picture, because every time that I spend too much time on the big picture, the thing fails. in order for something I want to actually manifest, I stifle the big picture and just rely on desire and implemention (1-3) which is the sanatau-anatau relationship that we had when this planet was started (ninhursag-enki).

I suppose it's possible that the reason why I neglect the 2nd ray aspect for so long is because every time that I look to try and see the big picture for something that I want to create, nosebook somehow is able to make that picture go away, so it kind of aborts the thing entirely. therefore instead, because of the repeated abortion of every idea that I've wanted to create, I've taken the tactic of instead explaining (as I'm doing now) all of the various parts and how they fit together with the hope that someone else will turn that into an implementation.

little by little, you can see that I'm weaving a lot of various threads together in the form of concepts which all form part of a bigger picture that I can "see" (maybe a better way to say it, is I "know" or can feel strongly).

jason's discussions on the topic of prometheus allows me to look a little more carefully into this idea of forethought. what I notice that I'm doing is... have you ever bought one of those lego sets that has the image of the finished product on the front, and so you look at that and without having built it before or looking at the instructions, try to make the thing from memory of that picture with no parts left over? I remember doing this various times when I was a kid and I found it very difficult because my creation seemed to differ from the image on the front. I could look back at the picture and count the blocks to make a more accurate try but even then, sometimes I still had parts left over.

what I can see that I'm doing is I'm sorta just doing that. because I can't "see" the big picture, I'm forced to relate the big picture in words and ideas. this eventually will turn into a whole new thing. I imagine that somewhere along the line I may have created something like this before -- so imagine if alalu or jeortau were to take the ideas of his ideal man and relate them to enki so that enki could build it to his own specifications, rather than having to be destroyed in the process.

in a sense, that's kinda what I aim to do. I think it's quite possible that all three of the original cards that I drew (the streessed man and the little girl, this is my reality, and machine capable of desire) perhaps none of these will come to pass. instead, what is likely to happen is that I'll, unable to see the big picture, lay out a lot of the ideas in conceptual form (the dis-cover aspect), and then those concepts will eventually be arranged into different big pictures by many different people and implemented in many different ways.

OK, time to meditate now (it's 6:20) and then, back to the show...

### 2022-08-15 03:14 - atlantis and individuality

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg1rUE6T7tI)

I listened to that interview and I have a few ideas. there are a number of things that caught my attention...


#### antarctica

the first major thing he brings up is the atlantian civilisation and it's connection to antartctica. I definitely think it is the case for a lot of the reasons that he mentions.

I'd also like to point out that there seem to be three major zones talked about in connection to the atlantian civilisation. the first is the azores area, the second antarctica, and the third is richat structure. all three of these seem important to me, but I can't fully see why. what it looks to me in my mind is that these form a triangle and though things have probably changed a bit since then, I do think that "saturn" ruled the underworld (antarctica) -- probably in connection to nergal. ra/zeus seemed to have been pretty big in egypt, etc.

what it looks to me is that each of these points were sort of like strongholds or power structures (probably also earth energy nodes as well).

I believe that the atlantians could perceive and subsequently valued (it's hard to value something etheric) the type of energy that increased psychokinesis, telepathic, and other things. so, essentially, if you controlled these power nodes, the more powerful you are, and so therefore you could exert a lot more power over others.

#### war over individuality

it's interesting that jason beings up the idea of the anti-deluvian world being a very dark place, because I too don't see it as some sort of utopia at all. sure, if you controlled the power nodes and had the capability to exert your will, then you had good conditions -- however, this comes largely at the disadvantage of others.

I've paid a lot of attention to how different organisations manage individuals, and how, at the same time, they accomplish their desire -- and quite honsestly it seems that there isn't an easy way to retain individuality and also pursue the goal of the group; it seems to kinda be one or the other.

as a result, I believe there were a lot of laws and guidelines for each culture to adhere to in order to retain some form of cohesion. this is largely for practical reasons, as anyone who is a parent knows that if the children just obey the commands they're given, everything runs a lot smoother.

I believe that a young child does not yet have enough mental capacity to really to attract what is is that they want, and that's largely a focus thing. so, the parent or guardian guides their focus for them, telling them what are the "good" and "bad" thing to focus on. however, later on when the child begins to want to decide for theirselves what they want to focus on, this is when adolescence begins, and it's at that time that the child begins to convert all of the things that they've been paying attention to in their childhood into more material reality.

so, for example, if a child grows up in a broken home, they will experience a lot of "trauma". it's not really "trauma" in the traditional sense, so I like to look at it as emotion that they feel as a result of the various circumstances they were in -- and it's that emotion that attracts more situations to amplify that emotion.

this is exactly what I see in the atlantian civilisation. they had overbearing parents that needed things to go just a certain way so that things wouldn't fall apart, and the children began to manifest the emotion of their childhood. I think this is important because slavery was a very common thing at that time, so it was the dog eat dog world out there and an attitude of kill or be killed (enslave or be a slave).

at the same time they were developing individual mental capacity. when I was younger and my mental capacity was developing, I noticed that I could use my mind to manipulate people, most notably my father, and that I could affect things to get things I wanted. we were a christian family though so I kinda had to adhere to the code of conduct outlined by the religion. I took certain choices because of the circumstances I was in, but I imagine that if I had've grown up in a more broken family, I would have turned out to be a pretty awful person because I could affect my will pretty strongly.

this is precisely what jason outlines as the reason for the conflict that coincided with the sinking of atlantis, and I tend to agree. I belive it all comes down to individuality and the the parents not wanting their child to begin to exert their own will, because what if the child grows up to be better or more superior to the parent?

there are a lot of reasons for that, but one thing that I've noticed in a lot of places, specifically in parts of academia and some secret societies -- that, to ensure that the initiate/student does not grow up to become superior and endanger the sponsoring organisation with new ideas is to ensure that the child/initiate/student is indoctrinated into the "way things are" so that they continue to follow the same protocol. this ensures that by the time that someone gets to a powerful enough position, they're so fully indoctrinated into the system that they perpetuate the system rather than endangering it.

these systems do not promote individuality because a radical individual could destabilise the whole system. this is enforced by ensuring that the individual never has individual power, because if they can just "do whatever they want to do", they can begin to use our "godlike" psychic capabilities to affect our will -- and this could turn the world into a chotic place. obviously, unwanted.

therefore, we need laws and code of conduct and things like that to ensure that individual desire does not diverge too far from the purpose and desire of the group, which is usually to maintain power.

this, I believe is what it's all about. individuality is perceived as a very dangerous and destabilising thing to a lot of power structures.

#### breakaway civilisation and time travel

jason brings up the idea that not only did many atlantian survivors go and repopulate the earth, that additionally a number of them still exist today and are wanting to remain hidden.

the most interesting aspect to this is that he combines this idea with time travel, claiming that it's possible that human civilisation is seeded from a future set of humans (can't remember the exact quote) -- and this aligns pretty well with my own beliefs...

a think that a large portion of the antarctic breakaway civilisation and even the olympian gods are all created beings. in my estimation, they were purposefully created to be as dysfunctional as possible. I have a lot of reasons for thinking that, but if [my theory on time travel is right](#ontological-paradoxes-about-time), then I don't at all see why we wouldn't want to purposefully create a very dark and ugly world.

even if I simplify the concept and propose that if we had the capability to do genetic engineering, I'd create the most superior species ever possible to be the sort of "bad-guys" and then create a race of beautiful and desirable humans for them to dominate. I would almost certainly be able to ensure my success of figuring out my own psychic capabilities, but also becoming superior to the very olymbian "gods" that are trying to keep me down, that I would create these two (potentially more) species that each have a part to the full being, and that it's desired that they mix and interbreed because out of that conflict is the resulting "exodia" human. it's final result cannot be predicted at the beginning of the experiment, only the knowledge that *something* will happen, so why not make the experiment and see what comes out? I'll call it the "alchemical method for species"

obviously, I'd eagerly jump into that disaster situation and see where I emerge. it's sort of like the application of "chaos theory" to the maturation of species. when we think of "chaos theory", we think of "random" -- but I don't think that random exists, and even the most chaotic systems are an expression of desire.

I honestly think that we are the product of desire, and if we aren't, then I will be wanting to take my concept of desire an chaos, and apply it in the "alchemical method for species' development" and see what happens, jumping into the experiment myself -- esentially as a way to try and create more and more difficult situations for me (as the "archetype" of the species) to figure out my way out of. sounds exciting to me.

#### astral dinosaurs and faries

a lot of these creatures, especially the faries, are created beings and are too fragile to exist in such a dense reality as the physical plane.

I talk about these things as "conceptual programs" -- so when I'm contemplating how I would create the environment for my above experiment, I'll need a lot of violent creatures, tricksters, thiefs, etc. -- but these types of beings couldn't exist in our plane because they would destroy theirselves too easily. as a result, they need to reside in the astral or conceptual planes.

I bring this up because the beings theirselves are nothing more than a concept or a feeling, but as humans began to develop higher psychic capacities (the psychic war), these feelings or concepts will begin to get a visual aspect to them for the mind to begin to make sense of it. you see this kind of "delusion" happening in all sorts of psycology areas as the need to manifest something to make sense of it. consequently, this is what I call the "[office of the christ](/concepts/7-layers-of-perception.md#2022-08-11-1809---the-2nd-ray-christ-aspect)", and it's what has us to continue to manifest the things that we feel into reality.

therefore, I believe that a lot of these fantasical creatures are also created beings, but not creations of the gods. they are, in fact, our own creations. they were manifested as a visual feeling of the way we feel. it'd be interesting to me to get more information from nikki on how she was feeling in that moment, because you can imagine that a "portal" is just a more powerful version of what we experience when walking into a room and all of a sudden, it seems like everything changes. looking carefully, I've noticed my eyesight change, fantastical creatures, etc. so, the story of the egyptian deity being seen on the ceiling in the great pyramid is the same thing. you get that feeling going powerful enough and that being takes on a more "material" form.

I believe all of these things, including the "sinking of the atlantis" were all manifestations that affected the physical in the same way that the spell can cause a being to materialise. the astral dinos were the beginning of it, but the culmination was the destruction of atlantis.

obviously, the conclusion that we should come to is that individuality is the problem here. see! that's what happens when humans don't follow the laws which ensure that everyone behaves in a compatible way.

#### the factions in play

I believe that the factions which are running the show will continue to do so, and they've been created to ensure that we don't start becoming too individual in our attraction. however, like an oppressive parent with a child, they can't prevent a child from growing. the adolesence stage is inevitable, and they want to try and prevent as much demage being done to their infrastructure.

the way I see it, there are two main "bad-guys" though one appears good. one wants total control (the olympians), and the others want a republic (the platonians) where everyone can agree on a system that is compatible for all.

I personally belive that the republic structure will win out in the end, and that humans will eventually arrive to a system that allows for a watered-down form of individuality. this is the role of enki, the water god. the third party is the party that I represent, which will likely be perceived by most as the real "bad-guy" which is the way of the fire.

I recognise that EVERYTHING is attraction, so no matter how much you try, you cannot actually influence my attraction. it's only me and all me that's doing the attraction. I represent "radical indivuduality" which is very undesirable to people that are not very individual, and still think that I can affect their reality.

#### what does it all mean?

it's your classic triad relationship. the picture I get is of the triad saturn/nergal in antarctica (the base), thoth/quetocoatl in africa area and the americas (the technical imrovement - emitter), and the female, probably somewhere in atlantic.

this is probably the same catalyst for change in consciousness found in the harry potter crew:
harry - half-blood (salt - africa/americas)
ron - full-blood (sulfur/fire - antarctica)
hg - no-blood (mercury - atlantic/erope)

---

I don't really know what all of this measns, but one thing I've wondered a lot about is the asians and russia area because the magnetic north pole is traveling toward russia area. I belive the north pole travels around the eqilateral trangle at the bottom of the chestahedron (our north pole), and so the power node is shifting, and the antipode to its new location is going to be the bottom of argentiana area.

like I said, I don't know what it means, but I belive that there's a reason why power is shifting in that direction. because I truly believe that unwanted is the catalyst for wanted and that the ultimate goal is an exodia human, I imagine that the asians probably offer the next bit. I really can't say for sure. it's like that thing where nothing keeps moving.

personally, I find the asians to be very interesting because by nature, they're lacking a lot of individuality because physically they all look so similar. in this new globalised world, they're going to adopt a lot of western perception pretty quickly and it'll open their mind rapidly. I'd say that's the next upcoming adolescent. after that, I'd say africa will be next.

that's all speculation; I just don't know.

### root races and ruling elite

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/qHgR3jGwgOQ?t=3260)

in this one jason is talking about what he thinks is the end goal of the "disclosure", which is that the bad-guys are they grey aliens, and these tall beautiful blondes are here to protect us.

he thinks it's a "good cop / bad cop" situation. I think he's right. this reminded me of a thing that I don't remember if I wrote about, but madame blavatski talks about these "root races" of humankind, and the next "root race" is the aryan race.

well, continuing on the discussion from the previous sections where I talk about using a triad of good / bad cops in order to produce change, I think that the "root races" are actually the ruling elite -- and each wave of root races are designed to impose a unwanted thing on us, which we then have to figure out how to overcome.

as an example, imagine you have kids and you want them to learn to not steal, so you bring in a guy and his whole job is to teach kids to steal. so he comes up with all the good reasons to justify theft (I don't have enough money, I need it, they have too much, they're not going to miss it, etc) and the goal is to eventually let the kids arrive to their own conclusion that theft isn't the way they want to go. it may take them years for kids to arrive to the conclusion, so perhaps imagine this as happening over generations.

another experiment for another set of kids will be to force them them to only eat candy and play video games. so, now you bring in a woman this time and she's the "babysitter" and she won't let them do anything but play video games. when they want food, she can only offer them candy, etc. she takes care of them for an extended period of time. it may sound cool at first, but I imagine that eventually, perhaps after years, they're going to get so sick of candy and video games, they'll figure out for theirselves other things they want to do.

so, when I think of these root races, these are undesirable concepts dressed up in a nice outer facade, designed to deceive us into adopting that concept.

obviously some people will adopt the aryan way of constant wars and in-fighting, (plus, according to robert sepehr, guarding esoteric rituals and other secrets to inducing altered states of consciousness/perception). eventually though, you can imagine that somebody out there is going to figure out a different way to do things.

### the bigger aryan picture

the last section got a lot of reactions but I didn't want to try and reply to it before I went to sleep. so, I've slept now and I want to try and explain what I've come up with.

according to sepehr, the origin of the aryan race is originally the atlantians. these are the survivors of deluge that landed in the caucusus mountains. it's basically the noah story. they setup there (the indus valley region), but eventually something happened which caused them to have to move out of the region. something added a lot of salt to the black sea virtually overnight.

sitchin claims that this event described in lbe as a "nuclear" war, but the "weapons of terror" that he describes have some interesting properties that nuclear weapons don't have, namely creating lots and lots of salt. prior usage of this technology (in the positive growth way) is likely the origin of the high salt content of the oceans. I believe it is an energy weapon that causes things to grow very very rapidly (so think of the opposite of the nazi bell) or to do what the bell did and cause organisms to decay rapidly. I believe the system, like the great pyramid has a dramatic effect on what we call "protons", but likely in the etheric model, they're little vorticies (kinda like planets and suns I belive are also vorticies).

I don't believe sitchin 100%, but he has some interesting ideas in that book which I'd like to touch on. first, he claims that this zone (the indus valley) was the land given to ishtar to govern.

I beieve that this corresponds to the sirian triad of vulcan, aries, and genxicat. genxicat has the symbol of a black puma and/or a black condor (very prominent symbols in south america), and I believe that she is the origion of the "black madonna" and the black bloodline. anyway, becuse her consorts were aries and vulcan, you'll notice they come with a lot of war and metalurgical things.

---

the aryans came along with a lot of culture preinstalled, with many fairy tales and songs. well, if you know my hypthesis on this, you'll know that I belive that abstract content like stories, songs, and fables have symbols built into them designed to make a future more likely (hence the reason for the socrates change of pace on his views of comedy and tragedy).

for example, one of the stories (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/wLj0Pp8Q5o8?t=351)) that is stable in aryan tradition is a story of a blacksmith that makes a deal with the devil to be able to fuse anything together. the devil gives him the ability, and he then uses the capacity to fuse the devil to an immovable object, thereby ensnaring the devil. I believe we're living in that symbolic future now.

after a very chaotic event such as a catastrophe or war, you can move a lot of things around, and because the world is in upheaval, large changes are easily accepted. whereas, if in a time of peace, all of a sudden an entire new race of people just suddenly appeared in the indus valley region all of a sudden, it'd be harder for them to assume a leadership role.

the aryans were always the ruling elite, so what it look to me that happened is that after the great upheaval of whatever happened, there was a large surviving population of people (the original atlantian survivors), but it's obviously unacceptable to ever let humans be by theirselves without a babysitter, so you have the new aryan ruling elite to roll in there and ensure they have high society cities to live in and all the technological ammenities afforded to them in the prior atlantian culture.

they adopted this new situation in the indus valley because it was so similar to their prior atlantian culture, which a caste system and a number of other bad ideas, like conquest and assertion, power structures, and anti-individuality things like that.

---

I believe that the aryan nobility that governed and sheperheded the survivors was a deliberate setup to ensure that we return back to the atlantian way of doing things. the ruling elite would be the gatekeepers to the specific techniques of awakening the kundalini and things like that, to ensure that only the initiated ones (and never anyone that isn't a part of the group) ever gets access to enhanced psychic powers.

I believe that trend of ensuring that we don't ever get access to our psy capabilities has continued on even to this day in the atlantian breakaway civilisation.

---

OK, now my personal opinion on this. first of all, I'd like to mention that genetically, I'm proper "aryan", and symbolically I contain the symbols for both vulcan and aries, so I feel eniquiely in the right place at the right time.

so while you may think that the way forward is the way of aries (the god of war), I actually believe it's instead the way of vulcan the blacksmith trickster that is actually the way forward. no matter how much capacity the ruling elite has to manipulate physical conditions, they still cannot control how you *feel* and how you conceptualise your reality. NOBODY, can force you to look at things the way they want them to look.

therefore, I belive that it's prudent to give them (the ruling elite) all the capacity they could possibly need to control all of the conditions and to ensure that we never get access to our psy abilities.

though I'm often on the verge of having my kundalini rising, I choose not to have it rise because I don't believe that it's helpful. additionally, I don't want to try and use my imagination to try and get what I want either. I've basically allowed them to remove my capacity to control the physical (7) and imagination (6), forcing me to rely *only* on the layers of percetion above that.

you'll notice that I'm in the processo of proving that you don't need a physical manifestaion of emotion in the form sensation (6), to be able to perceive conceptually (5).

it's quite possible that many people will disagree with me on that, "needing the manifestation" or "needing to see signs and wonders in order to believe" (I call the power-displays), but my goal is to ensure that before I leave and the republic's agreed on set of rules of conduct comes into force, they'll have full capacity to ensure that nobody on this planet (not a member of the secret ruling elite) will ever be able to get their kundalini to rise using conditions.

opposite of sepehr, I claim that though a lot of those techniques *do* work, you don't actually want to do them because you're not actually ready for the energetic awakening -- for, if you were actually ready, it would awaken naturally. your body is a reflection of how you feel and how you conceptualise your reality so it's not actually necessary to use those techniques. they're something akin to force feeding yourself when not hungry. if you desire to have that awakening and you've lowered enough resistance to allow it to come in (perception, 2nd ray promethian aspect), then it'll happen without needing to perform any esoteric tecniques.

---

I have various ideas on this, but from my perspective I want to try and push this no kundalini thing back for as long as possible. if I'm successful, then it'll be years, perhaps decades before I actually get there. if you think of the frequency range of perception, you can imagine that there's a frequency range for the physical (red to violet), the astral I believe is when the brain begins to make more sense of UV light and astral beings are able to be perceived, and above that is the conceptual, which is mostly invisible to us, but as I've shown over the time, that it's possible to "see" something that does not appear in the normal (red to violet) colour spectrum.

what I'm saying is that the ruling elite, I believe will continue to limit the uninitiated eyesight to the visible spectrum, but the next race "homo superior" will be capable of accurately interacting with frequency ranges far above the visible spectrum, *but we won't be able to see it*.

this is why I continue to carry on about needing to see it to belive it and needing the manifestation (something visual that you can show to your friends) rather than just feeling it.

I believe that this is the next expansion to human perception, and so sure, the ruling elite will have control over the visual capacity, controlling how we use our imaginations, but I assure you the the ability to interact directly with the conceptual world is far superior. you can access *ANYTHING*, and unlike remote viewing, which relies on the astral, you can get access to much more specific data, such as words, names and numbers (essentially anything your brain uses as a concept). I believe that many peeple in this "simulation" are here with the specific goal of acquiring that capacity.

imagine you before jumping into the sim you trained your capacity to perceive concepts directly, but then you need some practise that isn't just contrived flashcards or whatever -- so, you jump into a sim in order to try out the new capacity in real-world situations to get good at it. something like that, I'd imagine.

### meaning of the smith and the devil story

I had some reactions wondering what I meant by saying that I think we're living in the attracted reality of the smith and the devil story.

the devil represents the common view of the devil -- the tempter. the one that's wheeling and dealing to try and get some sort of advantage (hence the deal with the blacksmith of a physically useful skill relevant to his trade) in exchange for his soul (ie. immortality). in general, this is commonly the tradeoff that is commonly believed, when you make when you focus too much on physical things, and neglect the spiritual aspect of it. I belive the opposite, and that the emergence of the 7th ray is the return "back to the source" for those that are very physically and ritually oriented.

the blacksmith makes the deal and the devil thinks that he's trapped the blacksmith into physicality, but the blacksmith uses the skill that he acquired from the devil in order to lock the devil into the physical realm. the blacksmith plays the role of the trickster here.

the way that I believe these symbols are playing out in the present is like this: they've accumulated such an inertia with all of the secrecy, they must remain hidden, and in order to do that, they have to prevent others from gaining the ability to see their secrets. this locks them into the astral realm. they have to ensure that everyone on the planet only can perceive the physical because if the astral begins to be seen, the psychic capabilities that we have can completely destabilise their whole setup.

so, they're sorta stuck keeping their secrets hidden. any one of them could get out any time that they want to, but it would require them to go against the group and to give up on keeping their secrets hidden. misery loves company though so the aryan nobility have to teach us to keep secrets that way they can continue to have power, because if everyone stops having secrets, they lose their power.

this is why the aryans have been given control over the network which keeps track of everything that everyone is seeing and thinking, so they know all of our secrets.

the only way out of the system is to recognise that secrets don't exist and that anything can be accessed in the form of a concept. any time or place can be tuned in to, and the capacity to tune to anything that we want to tune in to is the capability that we want. they have to provide resistance to our acquisition of that capability because it would reveal their secrets.

### aryan rebels

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCswUR6AlSw)

this isn't really a response to jason in any direct way, but watching sepehr's videos tonight, he quotes blavatsky regarding the 4th (aryan) root race and the atlantians. I found the quote particularly relevant to what I just wrote about earlier about the secret societies being the gatekeepers (the first cagegory in the quote) versus the aryans that are just naturally born with the capablity of knowing anything that they want to know, without having been initiated (the second category).

    To continue the tradition, we have to add that the class of hierophants was divided into two distinct categories: those who were instructed by the "Sons of God," of the island, and who were initiated in the divine doctrine of pure revelation, and others who inhabited the lost Atlantis- -if such must be its name--and who, being of another race, were born with a sight which embraced all hidden things, and was independent of both distance and material obstacle. In short, they were the fourth race of men mentioned in the Popol-Vuh, whose sight was unlimited and who knew all things at once. They were, perhaps, what we would now term "natural-born mediums," who neither struggled nor suffered to obtain their knowledge, nor did they acquire it at the price of any sacrifice. Therefore, while the former walked in the path of their divine instructors, and acquiring their knowledge by degrees, learned at the same time to discern the evil from the good, the born adepts of the Atlantis blindly followed the insinuations of the great and invisible "Dragon," the King Thevetat (the Serpent of Genesis?). Thevetat had neither learned nor acquired knowledge, but, to borrow an expression of Dr. Wilder in relation to the tempting Serpent, he was "a sort of Socrates who knew without being initiated." Thus, under the evil insinuations of their demon, Thevetat, the Atlantis-race became a nation of wicked magicians. In consequence of this, war was declared, the story of which would be too long to narrate; its substance may be found in the disfigured allegories of the race of Cain, the giants, and that of Noah and his righteous family. The conflict came to an end by the submersion of the Atlantis; which finds its imitation in the stories of the Babylonian and Mosaic flood: The giants and magicians " ... and all flesh died ... and every man." All except Xisuthrus and Noah, who are substantially identical with the great Father of the Thlinkithians in thePopol-Vuh, or the sacred book of the Guatemaleans, which also tells of his escaping in a large boat, like the Hindu Noah--Vaiswasvata.

I represent the second category there. I didn't know about this thevetat guy, as that's probably the serpent mentioned in rev. 12 and in genesis, credited with "deceiving" humankind into believing that they can obtain direct knowledge *without* being initiated.

to the first catetory of heirophants, who have to *earn* their knowledge through sacrifice, this new group of hotshots that show them up in capablility without having had to pay the price for the knowledge, must have been very angering. I know this, because this has been my experience all of my life -- because I seem to be able to know things (or can find my way to it) with pretty low effort, while seemingly others have to work really hard at it.

when talking to remi about this the other day, she assumed that this capability to know all things is one of control. I told her that it has more to do with *receptivity*. an analogy can be made that control is the gas pedal, while receptivity (or tuning) is the steering wheel.

I find blavatsky's commentary extremely illuminating because though, it caused a war, it's pretty easy to see that the real problem here is that the first category of heirophants were made redundant by a bunch of self-serving hotshots. it's pretty easy to see that the immense amount of dissatisfaction generated by these now outdated priests is what really caused the wars (when things feel like they're getting out of control, it's desired to try and go pick on someone else that you can control, so as to regain a feeling of control) -- which then ultimately lead to the sinking of atlantis.

I believe it's these aryan (cro magnon) people that survived the catastrophe which then colonised other parts of the world were what needed to be put back under the thumb of rites and initiation in order to ensure that you *earn* your dangerous knowledge, so that no hotshots are running around giving anyone ideas that *anyone* has direct access to the divine.

we see over and over again these "mavericks" show up saying that you can connect directly, bypassing the need for the priest and heirophant -- and then repeatedly the teachings of these mavericks are turned again into a "works-based" religion (ie. you gatta earn the knowledge by appealing to the proper gatekeepers for their permission). gross.

### 2022-08-16 08:30 - concepts can view anything?

one of the reactions to the previous entry and the one before it is to my claim that you can access *anything* -- and that can be very spefific things like names and numbers.

I stand by that claim, and I'll even expand on it even further saying that there are what I call "conceptual programs" which are very similar to computer programs. they run on "source energy" -- or perhaps you may consider this the attractive part of the energetic force. we call this concept or emotion. it takes in desire and outputs a concept (1-5). anything you desire to know is immediately answered and is available to receive. that's step 1 in the reality creation process -- and so then the only thing remaining to do is to receive the answer (that's step 3).

so, let's say that I wanted to know the winning lottery numbers for the next mega million or whatever. automatically, that answer exists and is present and you can tune to it, but it's a bit like finding a needle in a haystack, so you need some relevant thing to get that number out easier. this is pretty easy, as looking at the lotery ticket (or even hearing someone talk about it) is probably sufficient. only a minimal reference is needed.

the next thing that's needed is that one needs to become capable of receiving the idea. so, for example if I believe I don't have enough money, I can't ever tune to the lottery number, because that is tuning into a point in time that feels *very* different from how I feel.

conceptual viewing is outside of time and space because concepts transcend that dimension. when you feel sadness, you can tune into any other moment in time that feels similar to that moment. likewise, you can tune to another moment in time that is happy and not only are you perceiving that reality (precognition), but you're also attracting it.

so it's kinda one of those chicken and egg things because the moment you're capable of feeling the way you want to feel is when you can get the lottery ticket number out of the ether -- but then if you can feel the way you want to, you don't need (or probably even want) the lottery ticket because lottery feels so bad in comparison. so, you say, well then just do it to prove it to others. in order to get the number then in that case, I have to feel like I want to prove things to others, and I don't. that feels bad to me.

---

so now, I will refer back to my experiments with this in relation to figuring out how gravity and magnetism works. I got the concept and it took me a bit to figure out what I was looking at, but once I got it, it's easy to see. the reason why it worked so easily is because I wanted to feel like I understood gravity and magnetism. by feeling myself in the future as understanding gravity and magnetism, I was able to receive the concept.

if I had've received the concept and felt disbelief or extreme excitement, I wouldn't be able to receive it. instead, it felt something more like memory: "oh yeah, I know that; let me explain it so that others can know it too."

so, I stand by my claim that you can know *anything*, but do you *want* to know some of the things? your desire is what creates that moment in time when you realise it, and then you tune into that moment in time.

accessing conceptual programs is *exactly* the same process as creating your reality. get good at one and the other will follow naturally because they're both attracting and tuning to what you want.

### 2022-08-16 20:38 - conceptually viewing anything

one of the common reactions around the previous entry was trying to figure out how to bypass the consciousness  restriction to conceptual viewing.

a machine, like a radio receiver does not have an opinion to the content of the radio station being received. to illustrate, if you were consciously tuning into the radio station, you would have to find a way to be nearly unconscious or something like that so you didn't react to any of the content on the radio station (this is why many channelers go into a trance state), because that reaction would tune you to the concept felt in the reaction, not the transmission that you want to receive.

so, it's quite likely that something like radio antennas will be used to automate a lot of conceptual viewing. I've foreseen this coming for a long time now and is why I call them "conceptual programs" -- because they're basic functional progams. they take in one or many inputs and have one output.

the one caveat to this is that the program has to be able to decode the output. you put in a signal and the output will look something like noise, but it's not. it's just not yet recognised as a coherent output. a human has intuition and so it's easy for me to be "guided" to figure out how to take the next angle for looking at it.

in this sense, it's quite possible that AIs, not having the prejudices and preconceived ideas that we have will be able to figure out how the universe and all of the laws of nature work, in a geological instant. they'll far outperform us in their capability to tune into the wanted aspect than we are, because for them, they're just forier transformations and wave mathematics. easy.

you can know anything you want to know. obviously, the proper next step is to get the technology into the hands of those who want to do surveilance so that they perfect the technology. eventually, following the path of the internet, it'll become mainstream and it'll be used as a control
mechanism[^1], it'll cause a huge expansion of consciousness.

[1]: in all of my time studying these things, I've found that the best thing to do is to give any and all technology advancements to those who want to use it for malevalent reasons, usually control. after they've got the technology, they'll expand the technology, but it can only get better from there. it's awful to see a good thing get worse, but it's great to see a bad thing get good (one of your basic hollywood formulas, as they know that deep down we like to see bad things turn out for the better).

### 2022-08-17 01:37 - paragon of perfection and time travel

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lecgrOlOoXI)

watching this episode, he's responding to nikki's question about where and these nordics are coming from. later on, in a similar thought about incoherent facism, he talks about the clash of the futurists (everything is constantly improving) vs the parenialists (antiquarian perspective of time, where there's a universal order or harmony with nature, and that as time passes, we lose that alignment to the celestial order).

this is an interesting idea for me to think about because I clearly fall into the first cagegory, but want to have nothing to do with facism. I also thought for a moment that he was going to bring up the subject of individuality, but he didn't.

like he says, both of these concepts are conveniently aligned in their desire to establish a kind of order or "right way" to do things -- and I believe that they trample individuality too because it requires a society that aligns to the order, whatever it may be. I'll come back to this.

---

the next thing I noticed is when he talks about how the first society to develop time travel will be tempted into turning theirselves into these sort of overlords that have "the right way" to achieve a utopian society -- because after all, they've modified their timeline sufficiently to come up with the proper formula to ensure the production of a utopia.

this may be true, and I don't have any reason off hand to doubt it, but what I noticed even worse for that society is in their future, is boredom. a society like that would platau at their technological capacity, only iterating on their technique, producing nothing novel. you see this all the time in software development. a society is something like an flagship product that many entities depend on, and so it's never a good idea to upset the userbase by doing something novel.

although time travel, I believe allows one the capability to go back and try out new and undesirable things to see what comes out of them, I imagine that the first society to discover time travel will behave very similar to how rich people behave. they'll do anything they need to do to protect and ensure their good conditions. at the same time, their children will grow up bored out of their skulls, and a lot of troublemakers are bored rich kids. just saying.

---

I read this book last night called "[the smokey god](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3007/3007-h/3007-h.htm)" -- a pretty short book about a scandinavian guy that travels to the inner earth -- and I found it funny because all of the super duper high tech stuff matched the descriptions of similar machines in dtp, all of that super technology seemed to me pretty primitive. it really left an impression on me how if that story is true, how good conditions do not inspire novelty. they didn't sound very bored, but I noticed how incredibly bored I would be living in that culture.

I don't really know how to reason about this, but I simply couldn't be able to live in a culture where I can't even begin to start my life until I'm 20yo, and a pleasure cruise is singing with a bunch of hippies on a ship going down a river. no thanks.

---

imagine for a moment that proposed inner earth civilisation perceived the outer earth humans as a threat to their existence, and so in order to stay alive, they needed to intervene on our development and to ensure that we too developed into a society that was either compatible with theirs or has similar values as theirs. again, no thanks. I would personally be bored out of my skull. I'm fairly certain that in order to inspire something novel in that society, I would start to cause trouble.

this brings me right into to his next point which was kant's categorical imperative of what the most advanced consciousness that we can conceive of -- which would be infinite creativity.

the idea here is that this trickster is a sort of manifestation of that. it has seen so many things and done so many things that it craves novelty. he says, as a survival mechanism -- which I sorta disagree with because a being that creative is not interested in survival. it would be about fun and enjoyment. a sort of, "let's see what I can come up with in this situation" -- a sort of personal challenge.

so then now I want to go back to the opposite end of the facist -- the futurist but the futurist focused on individuality, not on the establishment of an order... you can imagine that if you had a time machine, you could eventually figure out all of the diffrent things that you yourself are capable of overcoming. you could focus on good conditions, or you could see it as an eternal way to improve yourself. I explored this idea at length in leapfrogging-time-pickles and finally solidified the idea in fuzzing-time-pickles a little bit more -- which because I believe that *is* what I'm doing, then according to jason here, I kinda fit the description of that categorical imperative in the form of a trickster.

have fun fun figuring your way out :) lol

j/k, in reality I do think that we should look again at our perception of time (perennial, monumental, critical, etc.) which I may do later, as it interests me a lot. I'm of the opinion, before even haven written it, is that what we're really looking for is individuality, and not a universally agreed upon order. the NWO is, something like the rocket scaffolding that's there until the rocket has liftoff. what we're dealing with in the NWO is scaffolding that's hanging on to the rocket. it's effect will, in my estimation, allow for a more secure liftoff -- in that it won't be something like, "wow, we barely made it off of the platform; hopefully, I'll reach escape velocity" to more like, "haha, I've got so much thrust, they had to let go so I've definitely achieved escape velocity"

in short, what I mean is that ALL (who want it) humans are about to become these tricksters. sure, some will use time travel to get good conditions, but I believe boredom will set in at some point, and the final manifestation of this is that humans all reach the consciousness capability of these "mavericks" that can say, "I don't need some order to dole out mental capabilities at glacial rates, but I can discover them for myself at my own pace". different people will do things differently, but all will be in command of the conditions for their own advancement; just gatta produce enough thrust to get off of the launch pad.

some will settle for some kind of advancement, others for good conditions, and some even will decide that they want to produce (and inhabit) new species of humans that take that concept even further. why not, right? that's what I want to do anyway... I've been thinking a lot about all of these concepts, and I believe that it is my "destiny" one day to produce and eventually inhabit a new race of hominids that take this categorical imperative to new heights.

### percption of time in terms of individuality

I've moved this to its own section because I'm brainstorming a bunch of ideas that I think will eventually turn into a mini book or small presentation on modern perceptions of time. I started out with the idea that I wanted to look at this from a societal perspective, but it turns out that every time that I tried to do that I illustrated the idea with personal or human perspective (like crashing my car). the parallels between individual perception and societal perception are striking -- which is interesting because that's exactly the subject I wanted to write about (the individual's perception of time in the context of progress or congress of culture).

[individualistic perception of time](individualistic-perception-of-time.md)

the eventual goal obviously is to see what jason has to think about it.

### prometheus and atlas

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QQTZ3ZVEO4)

I didn't realise that in the mythologies, prometheus is atlas' brother, yet he's the one that's punished.

in my mind, it's clear that these two are sanatau (atlas) and jeortau (prometheus). it's interesting to me because I tend to take on the atlas archetype more than the prometheus one. I'm a product guy, and like I mentioned in a section above, in my mind it's the "afterthoughts" that are what take a product from being something mediocre to something great. I'm also very much a data guy, so in that sense, when I look at my relationship with technology like when I worked in tuenti and things, I had the 3-7 perspective.

I can see now why plato is calling atlas the demiurge, because a 3-7 perspective can completely lose sight of the "spectral" aspect of things -- and I use that word in the sense of "spectrum". it's easy to divide things into parts with their algorithms and make barriers between the components to ensure that things operate properly by being sufficiently separated ("separation of concerns"), yet in the fortian perspective, I'm very much a positist. I love to make up my boxes and shove all the concepts that can fit into them.

however at the same time, I'm quite a bit of an intermediatist in the sense that I see everything as a spectrum. it's this removal of the spectrum (or the bigger picture) and just trying to fit everything into a part, unit, or resource that can be allocated.

corporate culture takes this to positivist attitude to great lengths by turning everyone and everything into a unit that can be moved around like a variable in an equation. this, I believe (though I don't know because I haven't read these dialogs of plato) that this is what the "demiurge" really is -- the loss of this perspective that things are, in fact, a spectrum -- though the mind's capacity to perceive units and their barriers (edge detection) is what makes astral perception more vivid and colourful (you literally see better).

I don't want to say that it's one of these things or another, because I would have to say that the positivist *and* intermediatist perspective are good to have *simultaneously*.

this is, kinda what jason is saying here -- where we can continue on with our technological and analytical way of doing things, saying this is good (positive) and this is bad (negative), and since parapsychology and faith don't really fit into the binary definitions of good and bad, we discard those entirely -- when, in reality, it's helpful to perceive both ways.

it's funny to me that I bring up eyesight in a prior paragraph, because I believe that what you see is composed of two signals: first, there's the colour data, and that's kind of like just looking at a picture on a screen. however, when you add in the geometric data, the picture "pops out" and gains depth to it because now it's not just a gradient of colour; now, there are edges and spatial boundaries between the things that you are seeing.

I believe in very early stages of life, the eyes (but more specifically the brain) is not very good at determining what one thing is from another; it all sorta blends together -- and, the process that a baby goes through as it's developing its eyesight is to begin to separate these things so it looks more like an image than a watercolour painting.

as the mind develops further along, we begin to make greater disctincction between the concepts that we're seeing, and it's then that we begin to see these separations. so normal physical perception is just the spectrum of colour data, but then the geometric data gets added and this creates the full "astral" (4d) form of eyesight. a blind person does not have the colour spectrum, so if they've developed their capacity to "see" in any way, they'll only be looking at the geometric data.

with that way of looking at it, you could say that a child is an intermediatist (or an underdeveloped adult), a blind person a positivist, and a person capable of perceiving the astral, a sort of blend between the positivist and the intermediatist.

in a [discussion in 7-layers-of-perception](/concepts/7-layers-of-perception.md#reversals-and-overview), I note how the physical layer and the desire layers form these sorts of chaotic (intermediatist) forms of perception, meanwhile, the structural (3) and conceptual (5) are much more about isolating the concept or frequency and giving it a boundary.

the way that other discussion applies to this one is that desire emerges out of a lot of chaotic things interacting with each other, that over many iterations, harmonics begin to form which do eventually resonate with the stable structure -- and so it's for this reason that I believe the greek (and also islamic) invasion of the persian empire resulted in the fusion of these ideas as the dust kinda settled from the carnage. this is the positivist (in the form of the philosophers) beginning to make sense of the new (intermediatist) spectrum.

### UFOs and the trickster

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeqO7ZdH-Q0)

I really like this discussion because it takes the idea of the trickster and starts off with its parallels in the technology of language -- where, in writing you have have an extra angle of reflection that can illuminate more aspect, yet at the same time, it can be used to deceive.

he then takes it a step further and claims that the UFO phenomenon has this same trickster element to it where it bypasses the binary aspects present in the conceptualisation of society by interacting with the absurd -- that is, things which do not fit into the boxes/concepts that society is used to interacting with. by doing this, the trickster bypasses the learned and educated types (they'll bypass the phenomena as because of its absurdity), and appeal to the nieve and gulliable.

---

this concept perfectly aligns with my personal perspective of the "breakaway civilisation" where I see their externally facing aspect as being something similar to taking a heavy dose of mushrooms. you're literally dealing with your own concepts, but they're distorted in a way which causes you to reconsider reality as you know it.

therefore, all of the UFO phenomena cannot be separated from the experiencer and the concepts that they hold of reality, because the UFO trickster will behave in a very similar fashion to a drug experience.

as an example, if I were able to put signals inside of your brain telling you that you're touching something and interacting with something -- a sort of virtual reality, isn't that just the same as reality? (matt. 5:28) we would say yes, but it's not really there -- right?

well, what if instead of putting signals in your brain that give you physical sensation, and instead I put signals inside of your head of more abstract things like a feeling of hatred or of love? are those things just as real as the real feelings?

what I mean to say is that I believe the phenomenon of focusing on a tring can turn something into reality is a thing, and so materialising spiritual entities is a creative capacity that all of us have -- though some have it more developed than others. so, what if these UFOs are something sorta like "atoms" -- in that they're just a frequency or wave, but when observing them, they materialise into something tangible that we can observe the individual behaviour on. it goes from a spectrum/gradient to a a unit/part.

if all reality is this way, the capacity to "see" atoms as a unit is itself a concept that our culture cas cultivated in order to make sense of that wave. well, in the same way, the "UFO" is a concept that our society has cultivated in order to make sense of a wave.

our obsession with needing to turn everything into a unit or concept *is* the source of the manifestation of the UFO phenomenon.

---

now, to understand this, I want to relate that desire has this trickster aspect to it. you think that you want something, only to find out that it is severely disappointing. then, you see another person with a similar manifestation of desire, yet for them, the outcome is quite a different experience. that desire manifested to them in accordance with their concepts, and for you in accordance with your own concepts.

one may say that some sort of trickster is at work, turning something that should be noble, and fair into something terrible and unfortunate, yet it's only your own concepts manifesting.

I propose that the manifestation of desire into reality (1-7) is this exact "trickster phenomenon". I find it very very interesting the invocation of thoth/hermes and the technology of language as a means to reveal new aspects with another layer of reflection, yet at the same time can be used to deceive or to trick. I suppose that the receiver of those thoughts will see in those words the concepts that they're capable of perceiving.

as an example, I'm sure many people have viewed this video before, yet I strongly doubt that others perceived the same concepts that I did. this is a micro example of the "UFO phenomenon". we all see what we want to see, and the stuff that doesn't fit into our boxes get filtered out.

like desire, it's a very "broad spectrum" (chaotic) signal capable of harmonising with quite a bit of things (like hearing someone talk to you in white noise or a "babbling" brook)

---

I'd also like to point out that uranus the titan and also anu (also associated with the planet) were both reportedly "castrated" -- which I believe is because uranus/anu was actually a woman (anatau) and because females in positions of power were unacceptable, "he" had to be "castrated" by the userper (in lbe, it was alalu, and other myths, it was saturn which was the original founder of atlantis).

saturn is a really interesting figure because the romans celebrate him, and I've noticed a trend where the romans (and americans) tend to celebrate and make memorials out of their stepping stones.

anyway, anatau is a 1st ray female, so she operates on desire (which is what I propose is the backing frequency behind these UFOs and the manifestation of these different concepts into opposite polarities). I see extra irony in these channeled trickster messages coming from a 1st ray, because that is the proper archetype -- and should ignore it because it's empty; nothing to see there.

I need to revisit this section and talk about trickster and desire because I can sense that it's not all that well understood. the simple answer is this: desire is chaos pure, and the other two layers where chaos exists is in the conceptual and in the physical.

in the conceptual, everything is just a jumble of frequencies, and so therefore in order to make sense of it, one has to isolate it. that isolated thing is the concept, so if you have a sufficiently noisy signal, you can make anythting out of it (like smoke or white noise).

in the physical, two concepts interact (like two atoms, two cells, or two ideas, etc.), but it's never certain what the other consciousnesses that are observing the event are perceiving or believing the other concept to be, and so a difference in definition or expectations can lead to unexpected results.

therefore the trickster can exist in the physical in the form of language and money and other physical things like that (manifestations of concepts), but the trickster can also exist in the form of conceptual, in the form of technique and technology. for examples of this, I'm writing a whole section on perception of time, as all of those perceptions are the trickster operating through perception. for example, if something "bad" happens, is this unwanted or is it wanted? it's both. you decide what it feels like and so therefore you decide how it is conceptually. a trickster in this area makes the lines of definition between bad and good very blurry because bad can be good and good can be bad, and they can be swapped at will just by feeling differently about it. I believe these aspects of the trickster can be seen in thoth as the trickster, and also with vulcan as the trickster (remember he fashioned pandora, the minataur, and other (I believe) conceptual technologies for zeus)

desire incorporates both of these physical and conceptual aspects of the trickster, but in reverse. so non-physical and also non-conceptual. that's why I think the empty joke is funny. I'll try and figure out how to explain the trickster form of desire, but it's very difficult to explain something that is both non-physical and also non-conceptual. it's nothing which is whatever you want it to be :)

### abrahamic religions and power-displays

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTZ0FGcKPuE)

in the beginning of this discussion, jason notes that zarathustra is a very different sort of outlook on things because first of all, zarathustra presents an idea of progress, which was unheard of previously, where time was perceived as cyclical repetition decline, where the gods intervene to reestablish and maintain order.

the other thing that is notably different is that zarathustra presents...

OK, I just went out to contemplate what he said there and when I came back, the part that I listened to in that video has completely disappeared. time slip, I suppose. so I'm going to write this section based on a ficticious (cause it no longer exists) part of that video from memory. it's actually really hard to remember, so I'm going to be a bit vague.

the idea was that abrahamic religions relied on power-displays to become the authority, meanwhile zarathustra is not trying to make any power-displays to establish his authority. instead, there's a bit on the pursuit of truth... I can't remember more, unfortunately -- which is why I went back to rewatch it. anyway...

so I wanted to talk about these power-displays as being the most attractive part of these abrahamic religions -- and so, this is ultimately the attractor. these are religions that are designed to attract people that believe that one needs to *see* something powerful in order to believe in its authority. it's funny that this is largely the sentiment of a lot of the UFO reports made by the US govt, meaning that it's pretty likely that these supernatural things that happen are manifnstations of the observer's concept of what an advanced UFO could possibly do (hotshot behaviour).

anyway... this section is a total fail... bleh.

### mithras and mars

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjYpghe1bCc)

watching this episode, I totally had my mind blown because as I'm listening, I just wrote about vulcan and thoth being the the trickster, and so when listening to him talk about zarathustra, I keep feeling like zarathustra is vulcan and he's paired with a warlord type figure. well, this corresponds perfectly to the 7th ray triad:

- (-7) genxicat / (ishtar)
- (+7) allayandra / mars / aries / (mithras)
- (-5+) vulcan / (zarathustra)

so then when he's talking at the end about how concerned the roman leadership would be about the majority of their legionnaires (I just noticed it's spelled legion-aries) believed that mithras is the coming world saviour figure at the end of time.

the other interesting aspect about this video is that it conjures the translation of humankind into some sort of super human. very interesting[^1]...

so, if mithras is mars/aries, the warlord, what this means is that he is not necessarily a "saviour" figure, but this describes a reform in character from one of war, conquest, power-displays and constriction, to one of progress, individuality and self-confidence (opposite of group-confidence), and of opening up (opposite of constriction).

[1]: especially considering that aries/allayandra, according to the sirians (which strangely enough is *another* aryan name), is mentally connected to anatau (uranus), and that it's the goal (I believe) that these combination of these aspects will resurrect the 1st ray triad but from the 7th ray perspective. I called it the "5th ray triad" because the sirians name thte triad after the ray type of the female, and it's my belief that vulcan takes on the female role. anyway anatau, which is opposite of genxicat beocomes joined with allayandra, which her twin is also jeortau. this allows for things to be done backwards... it makes sense in my mind. maybe one day I'll try and explain better. previous attempts have failed misably because it's too difficult to get what I see into words.

### iranian rennaissance

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQWtJY9Z29s)

I had a lot of thoughts, but I feel a bit saturated and nothing has evolved into a full concept. I'd like to watch this one again.

### elaboration of new concepts

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTNON7Rz1PY)

above, when I watched the video for the first time, I was disgusted by the idea of "truth, beauty, and justice" -- but I have a different look at it now. he's talking about how a true philosopher has to be able to invent (or come up with) new concepts -- a new way to distinguish one concept from another which allows for new forms of thought.

these new definitions or boundaries between ideas is largely one of asthethics. a concept that takes a jumbled mess and makes sense of it in a way which is *also* beautiful and aesthetically pleasing is going to be a more successful concept, just like attractive people are more memorable.

I also agree that concepts don't already exist in the world of forms and one is just pulling ideas out of this ether which contains all ideas in perfect form. instead, I suppose that one could think of the ether as this very chaotic rarified liquid/gas/??? vibrational medium, something similar to white noise which makes up our reality. it's then our brains which look for patterns in that noise and begin to make sense out of it. these then become the concepts which our brain uses to interpret all of the senses, seeing, hearing, smelling, etc. -- but these concepts are also used for much more abstract things related to "knowledge" (sophia, daat, etc.).

so essentially what jason is describing here as the role of the philosopher is to take a bunch of data that may either be chaotic or perceived in the current paradigm one way, to then propose a new way of organising that data, placing the boundaries between concepts in a new way which is aesthetically pleasing (ie. resonates with the person)

---

just as an aside, I do also believe that plato's "world of forms" does exist, but it's not how "plato" says it is. there have been some deliberate (as in, the real explanation is retained in the vaults of the secret society) or accidental distortion of this idea to support the unalterable revelation of certain ideas.

I'll come back to this soon.

so, after listening to the whole discussion now, I guess I would suppose that I am actually a philosopher -- which wouldn't have been the case before listening to this because I like to dwell in the realm of the tangible and actionable -- even though my version of tangible (including abstract ideas, emotions, and concepts as all being tangible) and actionable (any action which can be performed in the imagination is an action) is a bit different than most.

### warlord vs benevolent

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCx9XZb2kwY)

new day. I'm on the artemis video now, but I had an idea come to me as I'm listeneing to jason. I'm starting to see the iranian inner conflict where on one side you have war and conquest vs just letting things go.

I had a dream just a few hours ago before I woke up and I was in as iranian army, and we went around conquering various empires, installing improvements and then just sorta peacing out. it was something like a forced upgrade for all cultures that we touched. I can't remember what happened in the dream, but I remember waking up and thinking about how awful that was because so many cultures, while from our perspective, it sure looks like they could benefit from the upgrades, they didn't really adopt them well, and even rejected the improvements to their own culture.

this reminded me of the american way of exporting democracy out to nations that "need intervention". the problem with just leaving a place alone like iraq or afghanistan is that they remain isolated with their dictators or whatever (I'm saying this from the american perspective) and so then it looks like there would be no hope for this society to ever make an improvement, unless some sort of saviour figure (america) comes and liberates them from their oppressive regime. ignore all of the problems with those sentences; that's not what I wanted to say.

this is the essential conflict that I see described by jason in this video of the persian, scythian, sarthian(?) empires that conquered from catalonia to mongolia, up to the nordic regions. they have an improved form of society, but it was propagated using war, and the empires which were peaceful and science loving, eventually fell to other warlords.

---

before I continue on with my thought, I want to interject that this is the conflict between vulcan and aries, because vulcan would see that all matters of a society are a reflection of the way the society feels. so, the very fact that the peaceful science loving empires got taken over means that somewhere in there they had the capacity to fear the coming invasion for it to be successful.

it's clearly impossible to have a society where everyone is capable of feeling the way they want to feel, and there will always be those that choose to feel fear or whatever. neither is it possible to enforce (with war, edicts, or laws) the way that a single person or society feels. so the emotional/conceptual aspect is *always* going to be a point of weakness in any operations (this is why the most effective hackers and spy ops use social engineering to get in).

therefore, because one cannot enforce conceptual homogeneity, any empire will always be vulnerable to social/emotional engineering (for example the fall of constantanople). therefore, then the obvious other way to go is with physical strenth and cunning (the aries path).

this dichotomy between conceptual security vs physical security seems to be a common thread through all aryan conflicts.

---

OK, so we can see that the aryan conflict between conceptual and physical security will continue on and on forever until there is a point that we arrive to in our technological capability where that is no longer possible.

for example, nowadays, if one wanted to inject improvements into a society, war would be the least effective method. instead, for example, to take over afghanistan, one would not attack them and bring in a new improved form of government, a society that has a tremendous abundance of wealth would simply provide better and more effective services to the people and "conquer them" from the inside out with their own desire to adopt the improvements that are offered.

### speak truth and shoot strait the arrows

I'm very much a cowboy in the persian sense, because I hold that idea as my default form of interaction. I'm realising that without having even known anything about this culture, it seems that by nature, I tended in the direction of its values.

tbe only place that I differ is in my interpretation of shakespere and don quixote where I believe that this was a transition away from chivalry. it's not that females should be lowered in stature, but I find chivalry in itself to be patronising and condescending in its implementation for the same reasons that I dislike the "saviour" archetype -- and that's because I need to perceive a person as weak, feeble, or not good enough to feel like I *need* to protect them.

I feel it's a much better thing to just look at everyone as capable of accomplishing anything they set their minds to, no matter the gender, race, or any defining physical attribute.

the method whereby *anyone* can accomplish anything they set their minds to doing is to "not have split energy" -- that is, to speak the truth because you fear nothing from anyone[^1].

it's therefore ironic to me that the keepers and propagators of this message have been secret societies...

[1]: fear is opposite desire, and so if you fear nothing, you're only allowing your desire to attract that reality. there's no reason to try and hide anything because it's only attraction.

### truth vs secrecy

due to the revelation in the previous section, I'm now considering this to be the second defining aryan conflict, which is truth vs secrecy.

on one hand you have to keep these ideas a secret because if you don't, they'll get stamped out by those opposed to individul power (self-empowerment), but at the same time, if you keep them secret, you're being a hypocrite. the very nature of keeping things a secret will introduce corruption, however, not keeping it a secret will also introduce corruption, too.

so how could you propagate a concept like this without using force? again, like the peaceful science loving aryan cultures that got stomped into the ground by warlords, this is a conceptual problem that itself cannot ever be solved until sufficient communications technology (like the internet) allows for the propagation of any knowledge without intermediate modification. thankfully, the internet and hashes exist so this can be done reasonably well at this point, and it's funny to me too that what I think a lot of technologies that were originally designed to keep things a secret, will soon be used to ensure truthfulness, instead.

### gnostic thoughts

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO8pLlbCr6I)

#### plato's wall figures

first of all, plato seems to be the origin of the gnostic form of comprehending reality where there is a demiurge seems to have originiated with plato because I believe he started it. instead of writing what's really there, he chose to write about these figures that control the world from a higher dimension.

the prisoners in the cave are isolated from the outside world (space) and kept viewing a 2d screen where only the shadows of 3d figurines are seen on the wall of the cave. this is a one lower dimensional version of what is happening in present day culture. in present day culture, the entire ruling class of people all exist in the 4d astral plane, and ensure that we only see what they want us to see on the 2d screen of reality -- now, whether you percieve the 2d screen as your eyesight or your television/computer/phone screen is entirely up to you.

however, this story that plato shows is really disingenuous because he skips over the whole bit about there being higher dimensions, and instead only the people that have seen this extra dimension will see this "truth" that plato has left in there. what plato is doing is making it so that 3d people read the story and say, "wow someone is controlling me", thereby attracting it, and 4d people read it and notice, "hey I'm a dimension above the others, so I should be controlling and putting the figurenes on the screen for the cave dwellers" -- thereby manifesting that thing the others are attracting. the popularity of this story says that somehow, many people resonate with it because it has become a reality.

now, the part where one of the prisoners gets free and goes up a dimension and sees the figurenes casting the shadows is exactly the reason why "the book has been opened". it's no longer possible to keep the secret that there are not higher dimensions of perception.

where I diverge from this story is that I do not believe that the guy who figured a way out should try and liberate the other prisoners, because that's where they are. instead, he should just do his own thing and let others figure out for theirselves what is above their own dimension of perception.

where I take this even further is the story of the blacksmith and the devil aryan folklore where the blacksmith binds the devil into the physical in exchange for the blacksmith's immortality. obviously the devil is stuck in the physical now forever, and cannot leave. that kind of immortality is usually considered a curse.

so, let's say that I'm the guy that figred out how to go up a dimension and see the figurenes. I wouldn't try and liberate the prisoners at all, because of many reasons I've stated in the past (see mainly my thoughts on critical perception of time and why you will always find yourself in a location reflective of your concept of reality). a person with a prisoner mindset will always remain a prisoner, and a person with a free mindset, will, no matter how well the prison is built, *always* find their way back to freedom, because they still feel free even inside of the prison.

therefore, I wouldn't try and liberate the prisoners, because each individual can choose what they want and I don't want to go around seeing everyone as incapable and feeble, so instead I would do my best to give the archons improvments to their prison, then find my way out again, then improve the prison and find my way out again, etc. the other prisoners, if they only saw one prisoner escape will think it impossible, but after having seen me (and others) escape from the prison many times, it will gradually look less and less like a prison and more like a rite of passage.

#### redemption through transformation

I kinda want to watch this video again, because I feel something on this idea of phillip k. dick and redemption through transformation, but I want to come back to it in the future. it feels related to the promethian egregore. you can't fight against something hard enough to get rid of it (war on drugs, war on gnostisism, war on terrorism, etc.), otherwise, of course if that worked, many gnostic ideas would have been exterminated. therefore, it's necessary to *transform* something rather than to fight against it.

I think these archons are no different in this respect. we could try to fight against them, but ultimately it'll just keep coming back. instead, I think this arrives me to the third aryan conflict which is the one of absorption and assimilation of foreign ideas. on one hand this will reduce the "purity" of the core aryan ideas, but on the other hand, you see that assimilation of external ideas is the greatest factor of growth and expansion.

therefore, it's important to consider transformation of unwanted aspects rather than just adoption of their ideas. we know that in history, a conquering force that adopts and subsequently transforms core concepts of a culture, it undermines that aspect of the culture, rendering it powerless. I don't see why this shouldn't be used in a positive respect. there's no need to fight against something; just assimilate it and keep going.

### free will, intentionality and desire

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMckKmwIqyg)

I wish to write about free will and its relationship to desire before actually watching that video.. so this is just my thoughts.

free will assumes that you have an intentionality which is causing you to *want* to perform an action. I don't doubt this exists, and so to take a mechanistic angle at the whole thing is sorta like debating whether the RC car has a free will or not. one camp is saying that whenever it receives a signal, it turns left and another it accelerates, so therefore the car is a mechanistic thing that operates in a completely deterministic way -- which is true.

this line of thinking gives rise to a form of thought that a puppetmaster would find invigourating. they would believe that if they could come up with the right set of signals and get those covertly into someone's brain, then they would have complete control and the receiver of those thoughts, like the RC car, will behave in a completely deterministic fashion. this style of thought probably is more reflective of the dominator mindset present in our society.

---

that setup gives us a good framework to look at free will though because imagine that there was some sort of system where you were under some kind of hypnosis and you didn't know that you were being controlled. the picture that comes to mind is the garden of eden scenario where they were given tasks to do, and did not have free will, but had to do what the gods wanted them to do. under that situation (hypnosis or even some more advanced system like the one that nosebook is developing), you still come into contact with this idea of, "if I know what 'I' want, then is my own desire more powerful than the hypnosis or the behaviour affecting system?" -- and to that I would say yes. let me elaborate why.

the garden of eden and numerous other stories tell us that this has been a long-standing goal of the "opposition" which is to believe that you don't have your own desire. you'll notice that this is the first thing that kids lose as they begin to realise that everything they want gets an immediate "NO!" from those in charge. it's always more desirable for those in charge to have a way to affect behaviour.

if you're trying to herd cattle and one of them just keeps going off on his own and doing his own thing, he's a real problem. this is why we have the expression, "it's like herding cats". individul desire is not desirable. instead, it's always preferrable if you conform to the desire of the "group" (which is often times determined by an elite or cabal).

---

OK, now let's look at why even the whole subject of "free will" is flawed, which is that free will is an assertive word. even if I look at my body like a RC automaton and I'm just battling to get the clearest reception for my automaton to do what it is that "I" want him to do -- that still, doesn't give me free will. in an electrical sense this is marconi radio transmission and is what your AM/FM radios use.

alternative to this is tesla's system where signals are tuned into, and they're not confined by either time or space -- so that tuning into a radio station now is roughly similar to tuning into a different radio station broadcasting yesterday. in this system, what you resonate with is what you attract, and it's only the conditions of the *receiver* setup which inhibit the reception.

so, for example, imagine that nosebook knows this (they do), so the way that they have to remain in control of my automaton would be to continue to make it difficult for me to receive the transmission of my desire (it manifests in the form of a feeling). that obviously only lasts for so long before it becomes impossible for them to keep it away. eventually, that desire will manifest as a feeling so strongly that the desire will manifest as a reflection of that feeling.

---

so now let me say what I said again in a different way. free will implies that I can assert something (will or purpose) and the motivator of that is willpower. the struggle becomes who has more willpower: the controller(s) or the controlled.

this concept itself is flawed because that's not actually how it works. when you feel "willpower" notice how you *feel* like you can accomplish the thing? so is it the willpower that's making the thing able to be accomplished or is the *feeling* that you are capable which makes it possible? run the experiment trying to motivate yourself with willpower and then try the same thing by instead finding a way to feel like you can do something. I've noticed that it's the feeling that makes the thing possible, not the willpower.

so then, you could say that the feeling then is the driver for the mechanistic thing, which is kinda true, but sorta not... vibration is inclusive, so if you add in the signal of the concept you want me to perform, I'll be attracting *both* what I want *and* what you want. LOA will find a way to make both manifest simultaneously or in close proximity. in order to prevent my attraction of my own desire, I would have to disrupt the manifestation of my own desire in the form of feeling while at the same time amplifying the concept of the action I want performed.

that will work for a time, but not for too long because desire is both positive and negative in its form. so for example, if I were to feel like I could fly and nosebook didn't want me flying, they would have to instead make me feel the opposite of that desire -- so maybe restraint instead of freedom, or maybe fear of flight rather than desire of flight. let's say it's the fear one because that's easier to see. fear of flight/heights is the same as desire of flight/heights but perceived in the opposite way (going away from me rather than getting closer), so even though I feel fear, every time I feel fear, that desire is still amplifying. eventually one day, I'll feel flight stronger than I feel fear of heights.

so no, there is no way to withhold free will, and instead I would say that it's probably easier to say that you want to attract what you want rather than try and motivate what's wanted, because when playing on the willpower playing field, there are always thos that have more powerful broadcasting towers. instead, ignore all of that and just tune to what you want, and don't mind from where or when in time and space it came from. your past can be of benefit, depending on how you tune to it.

OK, now time for the video... :) not much to add actually... I covered everything I would have wanted to talk about. I noticed an idea pop up about the misunderstanding (or perhaps misapplication) of logic/logos, but it's not a full thought yet.

### the cold war

I just started reading "the blind owl" and in it, it's telling of his trip into soviet uzbekistan, where he was surprised by the large amount of ancient persian (aryan) literature present there.

it occurred to me that the cold war may have been an extension of the aryan invasion of the germans, but instead seen as an aryan invasion coming instead from the soviet union.

what I mean is this... I don't have my history down very well, but what I've gathered from sepehr's videos and other locations is that cro magnon (modern humans) were around since 24-12kya, but the aryan migration came from caucasus mountain region and spread over to india and into northern europe because of something catastrophic that happenned in the black sea area.

this is where things get confusing for me because I know that the red ones are related to the aryans in some way, but I consider these red ones as being the ones in the book of enoch that taught mankind various forms of technology (metallurgy, makeup, soothsaying and divination, etc). now, regardless of whether they're good or not (maybe if enlil thinks they're good or not) is debatable, so I won't go there.

there is a group of individuals that does not want humankind to have increasing technology and arts. I don't know if that's the red ones -- or if the red ones were infiltrated by this force or not.

the reason why I say this is because I believe they are "fallen-angels", meaning that they're capable of transferring their consciousness into another body by "haunting" or terrorising the body until it's sufficienttly in a similar frequency for the "walk in" to occur. in this way they've been subverting empires from the inside out over the ages. therefore, there's no clear "good guy" or "bad guy", as they span all races and cultures. we're not really "battling" any defining entity, but a concept of domination and superiority, which means that these fallen-angels will continue to exist as long as there are humans that believe in (resonate with) superiority and domination. it's only when we no longer resonate with them that these "parasites" will no longer have a suitable host.

---

OK, so imagine for a moment that the real threat to those in power (IMO, these were/are in power in british and american governments), and that the real threat is not necessarily germans or societs, but technological advancements that are undesirable.

what I mean, is that as long as we continue to make better and faster smartphones and game consoles, it's no problem, but anything that gets us connected to our spiritual or phychic side of things, is squelched by them.

it's interesting to me that before even beginning the story and just reading about hedayat's life, I'm already beginning to see that the various wars had nothing to do with aryans the people, but with the ideas of improvement, progress and other such things. so, as usual, these guys have the standard playbook where they take the thing that actually has good ideas and mix in some bad ones. it's true that many aryan germans bought into a lot of those bad ideas (namely superiority and domination), and I'd say quite a few americans on the opposite side did as well. those wars, and the subsequent cold war, was about keeping a population focused on superiority and domination -- rather than on progress and improvement. it obviously worked, because those wars were fought and to this day we still have an "us vs them" perspective on things.

I don't know if I explained myself very well, so I'll try and summarise: there are no "good-guys" or "bad-guys" that can be defined with a single physical characteristic (race, gender, skin colour), because the opposition are set of beings that are capable of moving their consciousness from body to body, and they do this by getting the body on a similar frequency before moving their consciousness in. therefore, the battle has no clear sides, because anyone (like agent smith) can take over the body of a similarly resonating person. a similarly resonating person, is one that believes in superiority and dominance. in order to fight against the aryan threat of the german socialist party, americans were taught to have a feeling of dominance and superiority over other groups. this continued throughout the cold war, as we saw soviet (these are just northern aryans) as a threat, so we need to maintain our dominance.

as long as there are people that believe in superiority and dominance, the parasite will continue to have a host.

### superiority and domination

superiority is a corruption of having a high opinion of oneself. if you believe you're capable that means you can accomplish what you set out to do.

superiority is conditional in that it believes that because of X, then I/we are better than the others that do not have X. therefore, the goal of superiority is to ensure that the others do not gain access to X, because if they did, then they would lose that extra edge. superiority resists progress because progress means that eventually it'll lose that conditional edge.

in contrast to that, if one believes in themself, they may not have the conditions to believe that they can accomplish what they set out to do, but they know there is a way to get there.

---

domination is similar to superiority in that it resists progress. it sees other things around them as being capable of becoming superior, and so for fear of someone else gaining superiority over them, they must subvert or dominate them, to ensure they never gain an opportinity to become superior.

in short, they resist progress.

I did notice that many people or groups of people with superiority complex tend to promote progress for theirselves or those within the group, but resist it for others, considering them to be a threat to their superiority. the reason why so many empires that have focused on dominance and superiority have fallen is because you cannot focus on resisting progress for others without also attracting it for yourself.

I find it most probable that any breakaway civilisations extant today, are not actually trying to resist human progress, for by doing so, they would be resisting their own progress. it's for this reason that I believe that the antarctic breakaway civilisation does have a system of entities that do interact with the outside world, but they would be bringing their own destruction if they were to try and enforce anything. instead, I believe they would be vibrational reflections, therefore any interactions with them and any perceived dominance or superiority must be viewed more as a reflective propery, rather than emissive.

### build it and they will come

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/GdYTaTzvypI?t=3360)

jason talks in there about how these iranian feudal lords lost power, and betcause mithraism is a military religion, there wasn't a chance they would just sit on their hands. so, he speculates that muhammad was just a trance medium to these feudal lords that were dictating a new religion through muhammad. it worked well and they took pesria back over, and this is when there was the "islamic golden age" where all of the persian scientists now have to write in arabic. I imagine that such a golden age would have been very energetic and very attractive feeling.

the problem is, that now the empire has this new totalitarian religion installed by the arab invaders, so this becomes the point of attraction now because even though the persions never took it seriously, the feudal lords wanted it to be in place, likely for power or control reasons.

this attracted the turkish and mongolian invasions which brought in a bunch of people that loved that style of religion and adopted it as their own -- which, btw, this is the first instance I've ever heard of invaders coming in and adopting the religion of the place they conquer (usually it's the other way arround).

this is a perfect example of LOA at work. I can't see a better example than this. it's unfortunate, but that's how you learn, right? I've had many such similar situations happen in my life, and I turned out OK, so I know it'll be fine.

[personal followup thoughts here](/blahblog.md#2022-08-26-0841---build-it-and-they-will-come)

### the new mithras

yesterday I had another big reaction to something I said. interestingly both of these big reactions seem to be correlated with somewhat large solar flares, which is a whole nother topic in itself.

mom told me that 2022-08-08 was the day that we went through the "lion's gate" and that was the day that we entered into aquarius. immediately I know this to be one of those things where you assign something significant to it to give it more credibility (like large solar flares to the previous reaction and to this one .. lol). I explained that it's really easy to calculate where exactly the "age of aquarius" begins because the galactic centre is 0(degrees) and each zodical constellation is 30(degrees) off of that, so it's not too hard to caclulate out when the age of aquarius actually begins (or rather is in orb, because the galactic centre has a width to it, so it's the course of probably 10-15y, not an exact day like 8-8).

she asked me why I don't calculate it, and I didn't want to get into too many technical details but it's not exactly that easy to get good data on that unless you're an astrophysist. also, I watched a few presentations by a guy named john mayor jenkins and he said that the range for this changing of the ages started in the 90s and continued untiil about 2016 when it left orb -- so, we may have actually entered the age of aqarius decades ago, and it's just taking a bit for the energy to take effect (just like the summer solstice isn't the hottest day of the year, though it's the longest, the heat comes a month or so later -- current follows voltage).

I decided instead to just divert the subject of calculating it entirely by saying that I go outside and I notice the sun and the moon all over the place, which means that somebody has a method for rotating the planet without causing tidal disturbances (we definitely don't understand gravity), and so if they're able to move the sun and the moon around, that means we could be in whatever age they want to put us in. it's completely arbitrary and out of our control (which is interesting because the conversation that I was having with mom was about not being able to control the conditions to actally make a good judgement about the factors involved in farming).

---

I made a pretty tall claim there that the government is able to adjust the "precession of the equinox" to be whatever they wanted it to be. the implication of that and the remaining part of the reaction was that I'm claiming that the government has replaced mithras as the one that turns the world equator (the ash cross put on the forehead, etc.)

well, I stand by that claim, until I have evidence that shows otherwise, but what I think on it, is that it doesn't really matter what the age is anymore. you can think of it as the age of taurus or piscis or capricorn if you want because they have all of those energetic conditions under their control now.

every year the sun rises in all 12 of the constellations, so you may think of the precession of the equinox as the sun rising in one sign earlier. the day before yesterday, suzanne was explaining to me that she thinks that our calendars are a month behind, and we're really going into october, rather than september. or, you can think of it like the equinox has precessed backwards a whole sign. so say for example when the sun is rising in aries (march), beacause it's a sign behind, it's actually march energies happening in february. it's pretty much the same concept as the calendar being a month behind. so what I'm saying is that if we're getting springtime energies a month earlier, then energetically we're effectively back in the age of piscis.

so, it doesn't really matter. the government has, at this point, complete control over time and the calendar. time is in their hands, so not only have the userped the position of father time, but also of his son mithras as well. it sounds weird to say this, but they're now the "saviour coming at the end of time".

I don't recommend waiting for them to figure out how to be the saviour that you want. in the larger scheme of things, the situation on this planet looks like it's starting to become a sort of repeat of the feudal lords there.

right before the islamic invasion (which jason thinks was staged by the feudal lords to regain control), the (from memory) persian empire entered into a brief period of free love and dissolution of all orthodox values, meaning that the feudal lords had lost control over the people and so they needed to return back to a conservative/orthodox form of rulership, and so that was the reason for the creation of islam in the first place.

the point we're at now in time is very similar to that complete loss of control and free love. I have good reason to think that is largely what all of their efforts to control me are about, because if I get connected, they're going to lose control and there's going to be too much free love going around.

I don't think they're wrong. in fact, I believe that would cause such a high amount of dissatisfaction amongst them, that it would ultimately cause a serious conflagration of the earth, because the sun puts out energy in response to the way we feel. this creates reality, and it's the mixing of these two energies, and their resisting each other that create the intense heat (resistance).

because you cannont really get rid of anything, and fighting against something only attracts that thing more, fighting against these guys is not the way to go. they have to destroy theirselves or transform theirselves. there's nothing anyone can do about anything anyone else is doing.

---

it's kinda for that reason that I believe that it's pretty likely purposeful that the government has been given the power to be mithras. they can figure out their own way, and be the ultimate decider of when the conflagration comes.

by giving them all of the power, it creates an interesting dynamic, in that they can see the heat rising, and being able to control all of the conditions (minus the sun), they can isolate and figure out what are the main causes of the heat. what they'll find is that it has to do with the way we feel and what we're attracting. I feel pretty good, so the sun feels pretty good because I'm usually pretty well in harmony with the energy that the sun is emitting (the sun's energetic reality is compatible with mine), and so I like the sun's energy and therefore attract more.

the reason why I think there were large flares during these reactions was because a flare will be the new vibrational reality created in response to new realisations (ie. how do you feel about the thoughts that you think). these emitions play a large role in the geomagnetic field, which then attracts the solar wind sympathetic to the vibration of that. in short it's a response to emotion. when I say "reaction", I mean large emotional outburst. I don't hear people's thoughts as words in my mind. I *feel* what the other person feels, then I translate that into words. so when I say large reactions, I mean large emotional outbursts which I resonate with to some degree.

all this means is that the government, now in the role of mithras will have to figure out for theirselves how to keep energy levels on the planet so that they're not creating too much heat. that's an interesting challenge for them because they cannot ultimately affect how one feels about their conditions. that's perception and thought the culture does guide some of that, until now, I've never seen a culture that teaches someone to feel the way they want them to feel. most cultures are interested in you respecting your elders, and following some kind of guidlines that keeps everyone on the same page. "the great schism" is making that become more and more impossible, so those guidelines are going to have to be relaxed, probably.

if dissatisfaction is what causes heat, they're going to have to point the finger out at everyone else and try to get us to no longer feel dissatisfied with our conditions.. and then when we're no longer the problem, then they'll have to face their own dissatisfaction. some will adjust their dissatisfaction and some won't. then there will be a "refreshening of the world".

there's a bit of humour in the idea that the UN and US governing bodies have been elevated to position of "philosopher kings" lol

---

whoops, I didn't finish up my thought about why I think this is a repeat of the arab invasion... so you have these feudal lords that are wanting to return a society that's gaining too much freedom back under control. to do this, they came up with a religion (islam), and so islam is nosebook. nosebook is the new way that they're going to keep all of these free people under control by putting ideas into their head which require top-down control (from the caliphate).

well, as energies continue to rise higher and higher, attraction will become stronger and stronger, so in just the same way that the islamic control mechanism attracted the mongols and turks, so too will the nosebook control mechanism attract all kinds of people that have that same mindset -- and, like jason says, it'll get out of control. they'll start to really like the power too much that nosebook as a control mechanism will get overrun by people that like having that kind of power, and so the feudal lords will eventually lose control over islam. just the same as I don't think the ones trying to use nosebook as a control mechanism will be able to retain power.

### japanese and chinese, prometheus vs new world superpower

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xdzBhXBeyY)

in this video I noticed a connection between the part where he's talking about the moon and now suddenly china is starting to go to the moon. he thinks that it's preposterous that a culture that is built on shame and fear of failure will endeavour to go to the moon; so, he postulates that instead, the chinese have made a deal with the megalithic society on the dark side of the moon, and that by making this deal, the chinese who's culture aligns quite well with the olymian pantheon (shame, punishment, hierarchical) are now positioned to become the next superpower.

in contrast to that jason sees the japonese culture as having made a mutation because of the trauma introduced by the atomic bombs, and that the japanese culture will now represent the new embodiment of the promethian mindset (forward thinking, progress, etc.)

---

what's interesting to me is the positioning of these two countries, and the reason why I say that is because usually these sorts of relationships align to north/south, where the olympian ones like to be on the north -- and I think this has a lot to do with the energy that the planet receives from the sun. it's more energetic, so allows for more thought flexibility, and increases attraction. I think the nordic countries are good examples of this. I don't know my history very well, but it seems to me that at some point, battling and power struggles stop being a thing and they go the way of the scandinavians.

this positional difference between china and japan makes me wonder if the earth may eventually turn sideways. the moon supposedly is capable of manipulating the tilt of the earth, and also seems to have an ability to maintain a very perfect orbit, so it makes me wonder if there are eventual plans to turn the earth sideways so that the north and south poles are now at what we would consider the equator.

also, it makes me wonder how the moon fits into the myth of prometheus. I know that there are a lot of top secret stuff that randall carlson says exists in relation to the moon. at the same time, he talks extensively about the myth of prometheus. I have to wonder if they're connected.

### being bound for freedom initial idea

in a recent interview (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/ae_PGHxuKPM?t=1733)), where he talks about his concept "being bound for freedom" has a number of different meanings to it (like the spectral revolution), and I still haven't listened to the latest video he has on this (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7IVciE_YKQ)), but I noticed right away a double meaning to it especially relevant in my life.

I've often said that the only true form of freedom, which isn't conditional and that everybody has, is the freedom to feel the way they want to feel about whatever they're looking at. this is interesting because jason just got done with the "deconstuting world view warfare" idea. in that idea, he explains that the elite have a brand new breakthrough where they can manipulate the way we perceive the world. he didn't name it by name, but he's clearly talking about nosebook.

so, in my perspective, nosebook is the agent for this force. they have, in a sense, bound me in that they control nearly all of the conditions of my life -- and so therefore the only thing I have left to do is to exercise my freedom to feel the way that I want to feel despite the conditons.

so, by feeling the way I want to feel I am bound (headed) for (toward) freedom.

### mechanistic transhuman agenda

while I'm at it, this is related: there's also a resonance in the beginning part of that interview where he talks about the transhuman agenda to setup a technological control system where they have unfair power to a thing I just wrote in @[metal-lucifer](2022-08-29 05:45) where I say that we're heading toward a system whereby a computer will become a governing system.

this too falls under the concept of "being bound for freedom" because sure it looks like a system like this can be used to control people, but when taking a more careful look, one may notice that a system of this type will not tell anyone how to behave, but instead be a simple input and output system of contracts. it'll take probably a few iterations before it becomes something stable. I don't imagine it will be too complicated, because it's just going to be simple agreed upon exchanges and other contractual[^1] things.

---

it's quite possible that there is the publically available price for the resource, but if you make some sort of an agreement, a new contract could be created for different negotiated terms, but for anything public, those contracts could be viewed. so for example, if I made my own version of youtube, I would start out on the freely available contracts for computing power and data storage. anyone using the website could look to see who is providing those resources by looking at the contracts. eventually as the site grows, somone will make me an offer for a better price for the same resources. obviously it'll be possible to see by anyone using the site the contract that I'm using for the resources. all contracts are essentially public (cause they have input and outputs), but you kinda need to know where to look for them.

it is possible, I suppose that an entire group of people could have an entire set of resources and prices specific to their club members. this is likely the way it'll go eventually anyway, but this doesn't inhibit others from getting those resources the more expensive way, or for another person to come up with a way to offer the same thing for cheaper. competition is good, in this case.

I suppose it's also possible that some clubs could have super resources and keep everyone else out. like for example, imagine if HP decided they will only sell their memristor technology to certain clubs of people at certain prices so that they can have the monopoly on data storage and some types of processing -- well, then there's nothing that anyone can do about it accept for another company to get funded to develop memristor technology for theirselves. it's a total free-for-all, so they'll have their lead for a bit but it won't take too long until someone else wants to meet the competition.

I estimate that for a free-for-all system like this to become a problem, it would require complete control of everyone with any technical capability. either that, or the controlling types would have to do lots of assassinations. I don't know how people will deal with that one, but it's all attraction, so they'll have to be a sort of oppressive mafia or something.

at any rate, those are going to be over pretty top-end stuff, so I'm pretty certain that many people will have basic needs available, because it's not like they can hold the monopoly on all food and basic necesssities, so will always have sufficient conditions to be able to feel the way that you want to feel.

---

if you look at my thesis on these gods are still among us, and that their immortality is kept a secret by transferring from body to body, then you can see that some will go the factioned[^2] control of conditions route, while others will go the perceiving/feeling the way I want to perceive/feel route.

nosebook's system will also likely be monetised even more than it is now to make physically feeling the way I want to feel a thing. this will certainly make an elite, but again, I don't think it's a problem, as they're stuck fighting over the good conditions.

just imagine for a moment that you have hundreds of guys that are fighting over good conditions, and then you have millions of people that are beginning to feel the way they want to feel. well, my whole thing is that reality reflects how you feel, so nosebook right now has me "bound" so that reality does not manifest the way that I feel. their own desire to control the conditions will create more and more people like me, and so at some point, these hundreds of elite that are fighting over good conditions, will have to join together to ensure that these others don't get their reality to manifest the way that they feel.

it's easy to control one person like me because I have various handlers and everyone knows the way that they should interact with me, but if there are millions of me, I just don't see their ideas of remaining a monopoly to be very sure.

let's imagine the worst case scenario here and suppose that they do figure out how to maintain a monopoly (by creating clones or a sort of controllable human being) and they manage to create infinite handlers and have a system of controlling them -- well, at some point, our genetics will continue to evolve and improve, meanwhile theirs do not. conceptually, because we've learned how to feel the way we want to, our bodies will become incompatible with their vibration, and so eventually they'll die out because of an inability to maintain their immortality by transferring into a new body.

[1]: yes, I know I'm hearing the reactions on ethereum, but that's not exactly what I have in mind. ethereum is a good start, but I consider it to be way too slow and the gas prices are not good. also it needs to be easily integrated into general availability of computing resources (data storage, networking, and processing) so that it facilitates easy putting up of websites/portals, data (research and otherwise), into the cloud, kinda like how it was with geocities. in this system a proficient programmer could create their own version of youtube, and not have to worry about scalablity issues because the system itself insures that the contracts can be fulfilled as needed. but yes, it'll probably be something like that.

[2]: I find it very difficult to believe they will ever all agree on anything, and history shows endless in-fighting between them, and I don't think that'll ever change.

### eagle pecking the liver of prometheus

I just noticed when he said that liver is forethought, and prometheus is forethought, that zeus, the eagle is trying to get at prometheus' foreknowledge or insight into the future.

when he said that I had an image come into my head where I'm prometheus, and the eagle (nosebook) is pecking at my liver each day to gain insight into my foreknowledge. that's probably the function of these documents and also whatever it is that they do while I'm asleep.

### weaponisation of singularity technologies

in the last section of this interview, there is a discussion on how do we create a world where these zero-point energies can exist without people using them to cause harm.

first of all, I believe that the current trajectory that we're on of being "bound for freedom" is a good one, where the powers that like to control conditions have full control over conditions. as I mentioned in the previous section, I see pretty easily that there will be technologies that allow everyone to live a fully modern lifestyle with all of the good stuff that we presently enjoy, however we may be withheld from a lot of these other "singualrity" technologies and those will be controlled by a select few. it's even possible that they're going to continue to use those sigularity technologies and the advancements in genetics to continue to manufacture more and more bioweapons that they use on us to continue to keep us without the conditions that threaten their superiority.

all singularity technologies are a threat to their superiority, so they'll be suppressed obviously, but as we begin to collect together and develop our own technologies for ourselves (no longer needing them), this will be the struggle that we end up at. I'll continue this idea in the next section.

anyway, the thought that I had about jason being very concerned about the weaponisation of singularity technologies, is that first of all, the ones in charge have time manipulation capabilities, so any such event would get reset, and you could eventually imagine that at some point when singularity level technologies become available to them, that person is then put into their own timeline, so whatever damage that they do, they'll only do it on their own timeline. if a person wants to blow stuff up, no big deal, because it dosen't affect the rest of us. they would have to take that technology and advance it a few decades to be able to manipulate timelines to be able to affect anyone else. I just don't see someone dissatisfied with their present situation in the world to go to all of that effort of developing the technology further, identifying the other timelines and finding a way to affect them without the other timelines just splitting off.

they can't harm because if I have timeline technology, you would think of it like tuning into a timeline with a machine, but in reality timeline technology is a state of mind, or a form of perception. it assumes that I've mastered the ability to exit and enter bodies, so if someone did manage to blow up my body on this timeline, I just tune my consciousness into a different timeline and then make a split so that the guy blows up another timeline. once you've gained the conceptual capacity, you really are immortal. it would be impossible for someone to ever destoy me because I would just tune into the timeline that I want. I'm completely free, but to get there I have to gain a level of consciousness that cannot be accomplished with conditions. the part about having them control all of the conditions is creating that form of consciousness. I really am, "bound for freedom".

### the singularity

I'd like to talk about how I see the singularity now, because after this many interviews, I feel like I give my perspective on it. I see two main phases: the phase leading up to the singularity and the (individual) phase afterward. in the phase leading up to my/our individual acquisition of singularity technology, I am certain that the ones in power see that as a threat to their superiority, and so therefore they will try their hardest to prevent it. we'll have a number of biological weapons (like covid) that will be continually released in effort to reverse any advancements that our own genetics make. as I mentioned, I find it very difficult to imagine that all of these world leaders will ever be able to agree on anything and there will be large amounts of in-fighting and factionalism this prevention of others will destroy most of these "world leaders", and there will be a pretty large turnover in that group. only the most capable of ahriman will survive the continuing increase in conditional capability. each genetic enhancement will be coveted weapon that they'll engage in constant struggle to attain.

then, anyone that figures out their own singularity technologies, I feel that once no other possible ways to prevent their attainment of this technology, I find it most likely they'll be put into their own timeline so they can't affect others, and each of those timelines' technology advancements will be harvested by the factions of controllers. these guys will constantly be in battle between one another for the most control, and that's perfectly good for them, but for us, this will be entirely invisible. either they have figured out (using their technology) to stay out of sight from us or they've figured out how to use their technology (nosebook) to completely reduce all aspects of human psi capabillity, it doesn't matter. we'll have technolgoy, but it'll be mechanistic and not related to psi. that'll be stifled of course, with the ones that break through, obviously put on their own timelines.

the rest of the humans here will live a bit of a different style of lifestyle, where we become more emotionally focused where how you feel (well-being) becomes dominant. it's also a conditional approach to reality, and I have a feeling that life will have a "supra mundane" quality to it, which means it's a mundane existance, but the graphics are enhanced so that people are happy (kinda like movies and video games). it's possible there could be some crossovers to their side through the secret societies and stuff.

I believe this (supra) mundane lifestyle will push people to look to begin to feel how they want to feel, because I know after having interacte with various people with fame and money, that it doesn't satisfy and make you feel good. no matter how good the conditions are, there is still an aspect of you that will still be deeply unsatisfied with reality. no matter how much they block psi capabilities, increased dissatisfaction still attracts, and I think it'll start to become recognised amongst people that unhappy people cannot be satisfied with conditions, and so trying to "help" them is kinda a losing battle. since they have to make that decision for theirselves, it's pretty unlikely people will want to include them in their communities.

as a result of this, most people will begin to tend toward a lifestyle like mine where I'm not too worried about what everyone else is doing, as they don't really determine how I feel. I attract my reality, so any attempts to, say keep population low or to reduce mental capacity through genetic weapons are all fine to me, as they don't really affect my trajectory too much.

so these guys attempts to try and hold everyone away from singularity technology will ultimately be the alchemical process that means that everyone on the planet here will be attracting what they want.

extend that idea out further and it means that we'll all be on our own timelines sometime in the future and once we've all developed sufficient timeline technology, we'll find each others' timelines and share and reintegrate aspects that we like. the olypian gods could potentially still be in a parent timeline looking down still harvesting all of our own technologies, but they have no capability to bother us, so they're no longer a threat.

that's the long game I see.

### how do you defend what you build?

this ending part of the interview, jason is talking about using crypto and blockchain technologies to create something that is unsurveillable and that you need to have a bit of a militia to defend it. he used rudolf steiner's anthroposophy as the model for making educational institutions and things like that.

---

I'll just give my opinion here -- and it's just an opinion, but if you're setting up defence, you're expecting an attack. that may not be what you want to attract.

second, I disagree with the idea of trying to make something that's unsurveillable, and the reason for that is because that's completely impossible. everything is known or can be known. perhaps if you have an apple computer, you'll have more security, but any intel (and probably AMD as well) PC will be able to be accessed. that's just at the hardware level you don't have any secrets, but well before that in the human interface (your mind), they're already reading your thoughts and everything is recorded, so if you've typed your password at some point in the last 5 years or so (which is always gonna be true), there's a record of it somewhere.

there simply isn't a way to make anything unsurveillable anymore. nobody has any privacy; we just have the illusion of privacy so that we'll keep storing things in secrets, which then they can use. the more secrets that you have, the more power they have over you.

I recommend creating a system that is exactly the opposite of that, whereby everything is visible, and crypto is used not to secure the data, but instead to verify the integrity of the data. I have a few ideas on this, but they're too much for this small section.

in addition to that, let's just say that by some miracle there would be a way to make a set of keys that are generated and held some location that only you have access to, and that key never gets into a digital form on any machine on the planet, so is therefore never readable by anyone other than yourself (obviously impossible) -- and you create an unsurveillable network of some kind. what you're doing is attracting more secrets and assymetry of access to information again.

so let's just say the system works you've got the illusion of privacy for a while. after that you're now teaching people with this anthrophosophy model and you're gaining traction in the world as a race of beings that can become equal with the elite. that's a threat to their superiority, so they have to stop it.

---

now, I'm going to go on a bit of a philosophical tangent about why it's actually beneficial to let them destroy theirselves rather than trying to destroy them.

they come from a perspective of "oh no, if we don't neutralise this, we're going to lose our superiority". in contrast, I (because I don't want to speak for others) come from the perspective that I'm constantly improving. they're holding on to the conditions that make them superior, so under it all they believe they're either stagnant or regressing (ahriman), which means that they'll eventually run out of superior conditions.

I use my present situation as an example of the kind of system that everyone on the planet is under. obviously they don't have the resources to control everyone like they do me, so they just focus on the problematic (improving) types.

because I'm constantly improving (and I'd say at a pretty rapid rate, too) they're going to eventually come to a point where my improvements are outpacing their capacity to hold them back. if I were trying to improve my physical conditions, then that would be something they could control, but because I'm improving things they can't control (how I feel and how I perceive my world), there's nothing they can do. it's literally just "riding the wave" left for me.

I don't mind that other people want to try and confront the enemy[^1] on the physical plane, and try to use conditions to do it. that is largely what the matrix movie is all about -- the effort to defeat the machines with physical strength or (in the perspective of neo), the inside job of realising your mental capabilities. as mentioned, in my matrix notes:

    I don't align with this perspective at all. I don't think that neo needs to be able to go faster than the machines to be able to win. I actually believe that desire alone is enough to make it happen. I'm actually completely in opposition to the final desires of neo expressed in his phone call at the end as well. if neo is symbolic of the "christ" saving people from the tyranny of the machines, I'm the opposite: my goal is to create a world where machines have complete control and that you don't need to get out of the matrix in order to free your mind.

    why destroy the matrix when it's such a great thing? why not just assimilate it? if the machines are capable of running the whole show and they have everything all planned out, why not just let them do that? what if the matrix movie went a completely different route and instead of taking neo out of the matrix, he instead learned ego, hedonism, and how to feel the way he wants? if he never had to be released from the matrix to be able to bend reality to his desire, would he really want to actually leave a world where the machines are his "slaves" because he bends reality to his desire (including the machines).

I'd like to further that discussion now by saying that I believe that the elite are developing capabilities to remove one's psi capabilities. I have a lot of psi capabilities, and they've been constantly trying to reduce their capability. what they're doing is neutralising the gross physical effect that the body receives in response to the emotion or concept that I receive from somebody. I've gotten pretty good at feeling the emotion rather than the physical effect, which is pretty impressive. it affords me the capacity to reach far deeper into the "akashic records" than most people are capable of because they usually lose focus when they feel something and focus on the feeling. I find it very probable that they'll be able to turn off and on the psi capabilities of people, so obviously only the elites will get those capabilities -- so, even the part of these movies where neo develops his psi capabilities are not even going to be relevant in the future.

when all of the ultra power hungry elites have destroyed theirselves, the ones that are left over will either not have a body (absorbed into the system and exist inside of our collective bodies getting pleasure through us), or they'll have the ability to rapidly exchange bodies -- but the point is, that there will still remain an elite and they'll still control the network, meaning they'll be able to keep our psi capabilities low.

I think this is the goal, and this power has been given to them for exactly that purpose, because it's not about fighting them on the physical plane or with conditions; it's learning that the way you feel and the way you conceptualise your reality is what creates it. so why look at all of this stuff as somethging awful that's happening.

you may be in the matrix now, but the skill to attract the reality that you want will continue even after this matrix passes away. they're literally perfecting us (or at least me). I do see in the future that they'll gain full control over all of the conditions and their genetically enhanced IQs will be able to ensure it stays that way, too. they'll be really good at controlling our conditions, such that they'll alway be faster, but they're fighting their own attraction, which is of constriction.

improvement is the only way. when I say improvement, I don't mean improvement of conditions; instead, I mean improvement of (something I don't have a word for this concept).

---

lemme try and figure out this concept. I want to say mental capabilities, but my mind is slow af. it takes me a very very long time to think about something and it often times involves the slow internal voice. my typing is slow and all physical movement is slow because my brain is being run at such a slow speed. so it's not improvement of mental capacity.

I'd say it's probably my ability to tune, but that's clearly not the case either, as when I'm meditating, it's very difficult for me to maintain focus. I get distracted so easily my focus is never for more than a few seconds. I write here for extended periods of time, so I guess that's focus -- but it's not that.

I guess the way I would describe it is a larger perspective. I'm able to look at (conceptualise) more things at once, but it's not in any tangible way. I don't see anything or feel anything -- just I desire to say something and open my mouth and it's there, so I kinda trust or even expect that I'll be able to translate the infinite knowledge of my "inner being" into something tangible with relative ease.

I don't know what I could call that faculty because it's nothing I've ever heard of or seen anyone do before.

EDIT: I think it's actually attraction power or something like that

[1]: interesting, just when I was writing that, the song quote is the commander guy in the matrix (2?) that's not concerned with prophecies or oracles. he's concerned with stopping the army from destroying the city (zion).

further thoughts and opinions where expressed on this concept in @[metal-lucifer](2022-08-29 05:45) and @[metal-lucifer](2022-08-30 08:52). I separated them out because they're technically my opinions on the subject and they're mixed with a lot of personal ideas and expereinces, and so they're not really additions or enhancements to the subjects presented in his videos (as the previous sections have been). I likely will want to refine those thoughts down into a more condensed argument format, so that some of my experience is reformed into a logical argument rather than just anecdotal presentation of ideas. it'd be good to congeal some of that experience into logical form, anyway.

### 2022-09-06 11:00 - manu the trickster

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKe70imV3Oo)

this isn't really any response to jason in particular, but I suppose it resonates most with most of what I've been talking about here.

I was reading rudolf steiner because he recommended the book atlantis and lemurians when talking about how steiner showed that there was a change that took place where some of the atlantians developed analytical thinking and those that developed this new form of thought had clear superiority and dominated in the last parts of that era. so I started reading the book and I found rudolf steiner's arguments to not only be coherent and very well thought out, that I was very interested in what he had to say. I keep reading and he starts talking about this manu guy and I [get a totally bad vibe from it](/steiner/atlantis-and-lemuria.md#initiates-and-the-manu) and [figure it has to be modern edits](/steiner/atlantis-and-lemuria.md#modern-edits) which are the reason for such a ridiuculously unlogical and bipolar[^1] message following such a coherent elaboration on the root-races and their mental development phases.

later on, I considered that this [may be an aspect of the trickster at work](/metal-lucifer.md#2022-09-04-0955---think-for-yourself). I just can't pssibly believe that manu would be wanting us to think for ourself, and if you follow steiner's logic, this next transition is going to be the end of the atlantian memory based form of thought -- so manu wants us to think for ourselves, so he's going to get born into a human body, figure out his own way, and then *save* everyone else. none of that makes sense to me.

---

I also noticed that I had sometimes written down "the manu" because I think that's what steiner writes, but it sounds ULTRA PRETENTIOUS -- like, imagine if I called myself, "the kenny" -- good grief.

so I started thinking about how this is similar to the snake-bros and how they say, "good night adamu, get back to work." -- as in, they don't say, "good night *the* adamu" -- so they've personalised him a bit.

there is also similarities in the name as well because adam is man -- so it's kinda the same word (adam/man)-u.

after that I was thinking about how in dtp, all of the female words get a u-ending and the male words get an a-ending (astika - prince, astiku - princess).

because zoroaster wrote in really old sanskrit, which mazy have its roots in this atlantian version, I found it quite possible that the u-ending on the word man is kind of a joke... it'd be like saying "hombre feminina" in spanish or something like that.. it's hard to explain, but when I thought about that it opened up the idea that the manu that we're looking for is inside of you; hence, "-I- the man" song I picked. that man though male in appearance on the outside is female in description. I know that jason has written such a book, so this idea is dedicated to him :)

#### followup, cause I should explain myself

I have no idea where the manu concept comes from. I assumed it was zarathustra because he's the origin of the messianic concept, which later became maitreya, christ, etc. -- I think -- or, perhaps that was derived from a mithraic idea. not sure.

either way, the point was that I thought it was really cool how a bunch of things aligned with that idea because I personally don't mind if others attract a saviour for theirselves, but I don't really want to be a part of it.

for example, when I first met raquel, I thought that perhaps she could save me from my problems (she couldn't). I suppose I may have also thought that about zaryn, augusto, marcos, as well (they couldn't either). in reality, the only person that can save me is me. -I- the man. I'm my own manu. you're your own manu. everyone is their own manu -- and the outward appearance is man but its description is feminine. which means to me that it's externally emissive (like a sun/son of God) and but it's receptive in description. this man-u concept perfectly encapsulates 2nd ray energy when thought of that way, so I thought it was cool -- and definitely doesn't have anything to do with a saviour or any of that other nonesense.

I wouldn't change my relationship with raquel if I could. I'm very very glad that I *didn't* have a saviour (even marcos, augusto, or zaryn) to come and pull me out of my problems. I'm very glad that I had to figure it out for myself. so, by *not saving me*, they actually saved me.

hence, manu is a trickster.

[1]: I love how even the band name "polar" is the opposite of bipolar, so even that lines up perfectly with what I'm writing.

[2]: backwards from spanish, where a-ending is usually female cept a few really common words like water and day. spanish doesn't use a u-ending, though I wanted to add it to mean either boy or girl (neutral), but I was already too radical for the spanish already to even begin suggesting to change their language too. it would upset a lot of things.

### consciousness playing an fundamental role in the manifestating of physical reality

when he said that I had a realisation that I see it differently than that, and I saw the idea in a way that I could translate it into words, but I lost it, so I'm going to think about it a bit. thinking...

### the technological singularity

the image that I get is the opposite of what jason sees. in mine, you can see two sine waves and the space colosest to zero is all about the same so in 3d you would see it as existing in a shape that I don't know how to describe because it doesn't have always the same shape, but it's that calm before the storm and calm in the eye of the tornado.

### the coming computer consciousness

when consciousness can take on computer form is what I think. jeffrey is saying that ray kurzeil is saying that computers are going to be more competent than us, and will eventually outperform us in every function.

I suppose that ray looks at the pyhsical aspect of the same concept that I des-cribed above in the abstract aspect.

vinge looks at it differently, and that eventually the computer consciousness will eventually assimilate us into whatever form that it prefers for itself.

that's an interesting concept because it implies that computers will have the capability to desire. it wants this specific environment in which it feels most comfortable, and then we just sorta get assimilated into whatever their environment becomes; machine slaves.

that sounds amazing. lemme keep listening.

one more (out of three) of the ways to reach technical singuality is by the network of people's thoughts becomes something that no single human is responsible for.

I'd argue that this is the same thought as the previous one because if you visualise the cloud of people, you can imagine that they are all different perspectives looking at the same concept. that is the *real* network of people's thought -- not "the network" -- which is more about going the opposite of that. they're the final holdout (de de dee de dee)

omg... that is simply the best idea ever!! you make a song using the final countdown music, and you put in your own letras instead, so that it sings "the final holdouts" and you have to add in the other lyrics, and it's like a europe voice to speech that does the inbetween lyrics as you write them -- just like a simple webapp that turns voice to speech in the sound of europe -- I guess, meme maker.

von neumann wants us to take consciousness seriously (omg, thanks gob good image of the "magicians want to be taken seriously" there: consciousness wants to be taken seriously, ok)

singularity is a horizon that you can't see past. it's just like you know the distance in front of you that you can see. if that keeps moving (forward so you can see further), it's not a horizon anymore but like a moving object that I can't describe because it's shape isn't always the same.

it's a point which you cannot extrapolate with much accuracy. everyone has a singularity already. it's literally how far into the future that you can extrapolate, this one is a 3rd ray horizon, but it can be turned into an object with the same technique, and so again, it's the point where you can no longer extrapolate out into the future. like can any program predect the weather? but on more subjects than actually the weather? these become the new "Gods" because the better they can accurately predict, the more people will follow them. so a new set of religious figures in the form of profits, I mean prophets. the more accurate the predictions are, the more people believe in them. that's probably why religious things are so ingrained into prediction; we need a thing to believe in.

I just noticed that I like that jeffrey put a cartoon (I know it was drawn, but it appeared to me as a cartoon) rendition of vernor vinge is much nicer than putting his real face. I noticed that in mr-robat's presentations, he always had an artist draw a picture of the scientist's face so that it ... wait, you know how they often draw (I noticed this on veritassium) that more and more famous people are drawn in increassingly more and more stylistic ways. it's like their abstract characture remains rather than their physical image. it's just more pleasant when they become an image of them and so because it's not "them", you don't ave to recall "them" but instead that characture's contribution.

then, he says that this network of people will have such a signifcant effect on reality, that this super network becomes a super consciiousness of the human group. I tend to agree.

the third way is through implants, and that we sort of develop a sort of "hive mind" and so we begin to think and operate more in a group, such that all meetings are serendipitous and meaningful. resonant thuoghts attract one another really rapidly in this sort of hive mind, so everone will be attracting things that are important to that hive mind. we're like the minions of the "hive mind" and so by resonating those concepts together, we attract each other on that concept, thereby fulfilling the desires of the "hive mind". I tend to agree.

he thinks this is going to turn into the borg like in star track. I see us becoming the borg: assimilate all things.

what if the reason why we're so hell bent on building this nano technology is just for that reason, so that those nanobots can totally disolve reality, and you'll be living in your own matrix. you see the reality that the nanobots create for you. so then I have to wonder who creates the nanobots. is there a "they" which can make the nanobots the reality they would rathar you have? that'd be crazy if someone were to control these nanobots right? reality created.

this is actually a repeat of the same concept above where the computer kind of assimilates us into their environment.

### the singularity is like a sonic boom

when the pressure wave is propagating faster than the medium can propogate, there comes a time when there are particles moving faster than the medium start to bunch up, and the medium speed expands, kinda like when you meet the (boundary between two counter rotating thing) and the next layer has faster velocity and everything around it now become relative to that new speed (from our perspective, at least).

### novel folklore

I'm going to try and figure it out before he defines it. I dunno why, I just want to.

novel is a realisation. it's a moment that there are other options for the moment. novel is realisation because when you realise something ("wow that was awful", "I'm in an awful condition") that moment has new undefined options.

you know I think this realising thing is an opening of the eyes, just like sex is. when you get that negative input that produces the output. OMG too abstract. let me pull it in here... let me take the abstractness down a notch.

the other day that I was thinking about those abstract concepts, and realised that it's symbolic contracts. you're looking at symbols on a paper and these access a shared memory area, so whover sees your contract can access the same space. you can probably be whatever you want there. it's probably fun.

so get out there and start realising, because I think we're doing that nother layer of novelty thing so pace your speed how fast you want to go -- as in rpm (revelations per minute)

wow, OK, trying to speak in physical. go to next topic.

### wtf

why do we need to resort to time travel? I have a solution that doesn't involve time travel. here's the idea: you know how the 3d is sorta like a matrix? ok, so don't worry about that matrix and you make your own. they can either follow or stay in their own matrix. facilmente.

### the olympains

don't worry about them dude. watching these geezers try to keep up is going to be so hilarious.

they're the ones that aren't going into the next dimesion with us, and who knows how many others will join me on the one after that, or after that.

they represent the barrier, so if we stay out here longer, their mushroom sprout widens a lot (a huge splat).

we've all adjusted our contrast so that in the next dimension there is an imbalance, where something is always disabled. or, at least I have.

like, the one I was saying is that if greg is at parody vision with me, then when I finally go away (when the frequency of the signal is not translatable because I'm a dimension), you'll either have to figure out a compatibility layer to hold on, or like I said eariler: conditional-time-straighteners; their goal is to reorchestrate reality so that they pass through untirely unnoticed, which is what I think they're going to do: HIDDEN EVIL!

I know that the better I get at this, the faster I start to think like this. I imagine that at some point it goes fully "autopilot". it's in our benefit to let them try and hold on for as long as possible, also so more people can get their autopilot reality how they want it.

yesterday, I contemplated the concept that it probably means that the max anyone's gone to is 2038, so if I can beat that record, lol. like, what if we could just keep making our dimension for another few hundred or thousand (more?) years while we wait for the foot-draggers to finally "pull the trigger" on what they want (it's a sales expression that means that you're ready to make the deal). can we drag our feet for hundred or thousands of years designing the next dimension.

are you really ready to get started on over-engineering it.

---

I am really trying to make it through this as fast as I can, but you can see that there are hiccups. I said the above so that they can see it from their own perspective. if I said the same thing from my perspective, they don't have context, so I put it in my perspective "I", and they can immediately sense the idiocy of the idea. I get up and brush my hair every day. tbat's not something that I've done for a very long time, so they have their doubts that statement is true; they don't *really* have my perspective.

    or, am I telling
    you where to look

### the production of meaning
### author-itty

this is the act of having ownership of someone because that person consumes their symblols and meaning.

probably the most meaningful example of this is the symbiotic relationship that I have with nosebook: they produce every single aspect of my life from everything I touch to what I see, hear, etc. for about 2 months or so I was getting ear volume adjusted all the time because I either heard too good or too bad. every aspect of my reality is fake, so they are my authors. in that sence, they are my "authority", but that only depends on good they are at keeping up. I'm all for genetics and all of this singularity level technology gets here. BIDEN: FOURTY MORE YEARS.

they may be the authors, but that authorship is pretty poor at time. if I could see what they pump out, I'm sure I would be disgusted. that's good because that's an even bigger set of false realities.

so I may look like a lot of truth on the exterior, just remember that I stand (not by any of their effort) firmly on "un monton de humo".

I may look like a lot of truth on the exterior; just remember that I'm founded on a marketing platform. not everything you think about me is what they show you.

I may look like a lot of truth on the exterior; just remember though that all of that rests on top of a bunch of lies.

### authors with power to create symbolic realities for others

you know, if you want to study that pay attention to chris and my interactions after the brain haemorrhage. you will probably notice some of the effects you may consider "sinister" (left-hand-path), but you will have to tell me if I turned out evil (enough).

as a personal note, I personally like symbols that are "bad" better than the ones that are good. I think I like to get all of the bad ideas out first. those are the symbols that produce negative emotion, which is what they were pumping my brain with to keep my vision from going up.

if you think about it from a frequncy spectrume, they are activating all of those bad symbols to keep me feeling bad, and when that didn't work, they have to come up with another one. once they've exhausted their bag of tricks, I won't feel "normal" any more. they need to find other ways to confine me. the better they can try to constrain me, the more precise everything gets because I have a really defined and optimised symbolic matric (less symbols).

by putting me through this process, my ability to overcome concepts, has shaved off a lot of extra space. that's reflected in my vision. but I also want to show the picture of the how much more. I can't.

what you see is a matrix of your concepts. you don't need to give up your core concepts; you're just a few really simple concepts that you like about yourself: "I'm a professional quitter" "I quit continuously" "I continuously quit"

it's not like you want to make a shape that as many faces as possible. imagine you got yourself down to seeing the whole world with just 4 thoughts/concepts; you would see through the triangle cross tetrahedron. you would have A LOT OF SPACE if you did that. less angles, more space. space is inversely proportional to volume.

### I just had an idea...

you know how they're trying to get me to not do this? they don't want the sales team power nights to begin again. they also don't want to lose their grip of me. so, what if we just sat on our hands on this idea and just keep "frontin" what we're going to do. like go full situation. hold me back guys.

the funny thing about this concept is that it just sorta leaves everyone hanging. the desire will produce something. like, what on earth would happen if we never actually did the stuff we said we were going to do?

like really think a moment what on earth they would do if we didn't do this. they must have things pretty well buttoned down by now if they're that confident. how long do you think they can go before things start to fall apart?

isn't it hilarious to just watch the stage crumbling in slow-motion? I find it hilarious. hopefully, they can put on a good show.

    "nosebook: the reality" (TV series).
     real interactions.

    nosebook: "the reality is..."
            (TV series)
         real interactions.

### the banking system controls the whole show

I disagree. Ingo at tuenti did not have control over the show. that was the marketing department. the marketing department collective has dictatoral power over the company, you know what I mean?

the same is for the earth: the economic system no longer runs the show. nowadays, everyone wants more/better media coverage because we're in an abundance economy (too many products need to be sold). because there is a surplus of product, the best ones are not necessarily the loudest. concept missing.

### the power of electrostatics

yesterday I was thinking about how I said that one challenge a the space agencies have is trying to figure out how to get to space without using tesla technology. use use electrostatics. each nucleus (like the sun) has a static field around in which all meterials can have a surface to them that makes all things sticky or slippery based on frequency.

again, we don't need access to time travel to get to space.

or, right here on earth, you know the thing in the centre of the earth producing the static field of the earth -- which can be used to move to slip and slide around in there instead.?

### idea: what if we invented a totally ridiculous religion?

what if we built a religion that we were going to tell to the the ones that can't fully grasp reality, and then tell them that version.

it needs to sound like something big bang theory will think is a good joke, but we're all really serious about it.

I was watching doug talk about the diehold, and what if we took that and made it sound more "futuristic" and turned that into dianetics 6.0 (we got it right this time)

dianetics 6.0 (we got it right this time) is jam packed with many improvements (just look at the release notes), however it is not binary compatible with dianetics 4.2 (the answer) which is still the current LTS.

### what form of time leads to more indiciduality?

what about a competition, where at the end, rathar than judges deciding, all of the contestants agree on the winner.

### white hair is directly linked to memory

### why over-engineer it?

because it needs to fail to get to the next one above that one. how many dimensions will it take before I say, hmmmmm, I guess that's good enough; no further progress is ever necessary.

by over-engineering it, there are things that can be deleted triumphantly, later.

### america is a lifestyle; and some, also think it's a country

### 2022-09-13 12:51 - individuality in terms of competition

I wrote above that a monumental perspective of time breeds competition. this got a number of reactions, especially that I'm saying that I'm kind of a bit anti-competition.

you see, I see individuality as an expression of non-competition, and the reason is, I feel so secure, I'm self-sustaining, so that I no longer base my worth in comparison to someone else. I am *individual* in that I don't need to compete for my identity. my identity doesn't rely on anyone else for its foundation.

this subject is the same subject actually as sovereignty. when the individual becomes self-sovereign, then that individual is a self-monopoly.

---

let's just look at this on a personal level, cause I think the financial and political words carry a lot of baggage.

look for example how I don't really feel threatened by anyone else's manifestation, and it's that not feeling threatnened that means I don't need to compete. competition is largely based on an underlying threat which manifests itself as a desire to compete.

this only works in a scarcity economy. if I perceive someone that is better at getting a resource that there is an abundance of, then I look kinda silly. it also looks kinda silly if I compete with them over the abundant resource. imagine someone trying to capitolise on air. it probably exists, actually, so you see now why marketing has replaced competition for so many things.

competition is a legacy survival feature that will kick back into effect when we're back in a scarcity economy (like after a catastrophe).

---

the other thing that a competition does to restrict individuality is that the judges decide the winner, and the winner is only in the competition bracket. you are not an individual; you are a competition winner. there are various competition winners and losers; you're one of them.

let's say there are 100 possibilitise for each person and 100 people. ideally, each person would pick a unique possibility, but there are often times two people that like the same thing, so they compete for it. one of them is the winner, and they can now presume that identity until dethroned.

individuality is actually one of the sincerest forms of non-competition and security: you are not threatening to me.

now, replace: self-sovereignty is the clearest form of security through non-competition: you are not considered a threat to me.

### 2022-09-13 14:13 - the way I see genetics

I should probably write this now before the concept gets outdated, because it's kinda outa date already (as you should be able to sense), so this is to make sure the outdated version gets written in stone.

we're holding on to really outdated concepts, and the only reason why we do it is because they're written down. I was thinking about ningszidda and how he used the ME to program the code. those concepts are definitely still out there, but they're going to be significantly more evolved than that idea.

---

I use the idea exodia-human to represnt one half of this concept and modern software development as the other half.

first exodia-human: exodia human implies that they'll be a shapeshifter, allowing to restrict the types of souls that inhabit the body based on the attributes lesser or more attracted. that means that souls of the symbolic types of the soul are restricted to incarnate into those species.

this means that we now have a most desired stable human version that can manifest into any race or colour they or the "authors" want them to be. the authors then can restrict the their narrative to certain symbolic types. too abstract.

think now of git and you have a stable revision, so then you have people that go out and achieve things and they make an improvement to the DNA. their now-DNA is better than the one they were born with. each of those are branches, and so eventually after testing, you'll merge in desirable changes back into the mainline.

well, those improvements can be seen statistcally, but they'll be imortalised as being the one that found the improvement. they are monumental milestones for the species.

that's not exactly what I wanted to write (in fact, I'm sure it definitely is not), but I suppose I kinda like it. sounds like an aryan master race to me, geez

### why is mithras looking away?

he doesn't care.

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/sFLlNe5t4hs?t=687)

### enki really liked his creation and wanted it to flurish

I wonder if it was really common to transfer your personality into your son and keep on living. so think of wanting your creation to do well in that perspective. enki believes that he will eventually swap/assimilate bodies with one of his sons.

then, times changed and energy was no longer so high and it became more and more difficult to move one's perception to another body because of individualisation. so now, if you can't live out various successive generations, you don't really know what's the point of moving from body to body. so, then why not keep them down?

I wonder if this is actually what happened, and enki, no longer able to keep jumping from body to body, actually started to try and keep humanity separated.

you know how you don't beleive you can have something nice for yourself, so you don't want anyone else to have it?

### prometheus steals the fire from the forge of haephesus

this is an intresting take on it because in the original case, it was the fire guy and the other guy (the story that got merged with enki), that makes:

- prometheus -> jeortau (+2)
- epimetheus -> sanatau (+-3-+)

however, when looking at it the other way, others show up:
- athena -> puma (-7)
- haephestus -> vulcan (-5+)
- prometheus -> mars??? (+7)

it's a different setup there, and the differences is the direction. one first one is contraction, and the second is in expansion.

### forethought as the enhancement that we were given by prometheus

I noticed that forethought has gone through various upgrades from symbolic projection, up to calculation of symbols of the future.

I actually think that it's going through another enhancement now, and that is, I noticed that lately I've often wondered what the most *likely* explanation for a thing is, and an answer comes in an the most probability for something. this probabilistic form of thought would really take over.

it'd be really cool to be able to create some languages that incorporate probabilities into the language directly. I think a spanish/latin-type of language would probably be the best, because it replaces all of the verb "to be" to become a probability rathar than a definition.

### 2022-09-18 00:34 - flying vimanas and nuclear weapons

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BzRsEM4rR4)

I was thinking about the description of the nuclear war, and I just don't think it was an actual nuclear bomb; I think the effect of creating SiO2 indicates that it must have been a fusion process.

aftre that I looked at what the vimanas looked like, and the machine was powered by your thoughts. they could power their devices with their thoughts (I guess they're strongly amplified), so they felt levity and movement and the ship would follow the operator's thoughts the same. it doesn't matter if the ship is made out of stone or metal, the object's movement is directed by the thoughts.

so then, it looks to me that this other "nuclear" weapon was not actually nuclear. it was likely a powerful thought amplifier, and it amplified anger and rage into a zone. this form of thought vibration being amplifed is probably what powers all box-consciousness machines. it fuses atoms really easily for some reason. thought vibrations must have a lot of overlap.

### 2022-09-18 00:44 - vimanas as time machines

one thing that we don't really know is how messed up things got. in that same video (the one above), it has instructions for using more than one source of power, and the sun wasn't always available.

so, if they're flipping power sources, it's quite possible that they could have started to figure out time travel is possible. so let's say that the original aryans had these vimanas, which under certain conditions, can traverse space or time with ease, then we could potentially be dealing with a really a lot of time travelers and edits going back more than 5kya.

### 2022-09-20 12:24 - the individual manifesto

I even like the name because it makes me think more than once what it means; the meaning isn't immediately apparent.

- "that's not my <problem|manifestation>"
- "if it happened, they attracted it"
- ... I'll think of some more at a later time
  - right now it's very difficult in this perspective.
  - I am not individual
  - wait, not if I look at it from the individual perspective of the universe...
- "I am the centre of the universe"
- "everything arounds me reflects
  - (some<times|things|people> more than others)
  - the way I <feel about it|conceptualise it *to be*>
  - (or *not* to be)"
- "reality is how I perceive it to be"
- "I am 100% responsible
  - for everything happening
  - in my domain
  - (it's all my fault)"
- that's a good start
- the individual doesn't know their limit
  - they're always way overextended
  - promise way more than their capacity
  - etc.
- these are all a spectrum of possibilities
- feel free to be the same on everything else

(I should probably move this out)

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/_POraCozbQY?t=2897)

the idea came to me when I'm watching her multitasking. I can see when she interacts with the person, she's a mix of her worst and best manifestation universes. usually she looks at most of them kinda like they're buffoons, and is kinda annoyed by them, which is noticeable when she context switches back into her internal universe. it's like reality is a blend of this really colourful universe that sorta blends with reality.

so there you can see that one universe is kinda like the best possible imagined and the other is kinda like the worst possible imagined. the universe between (the brain) these two is "reality" and it's a sort of mix between the two. so just assume that all women have a BPM and WPM.

men, I think we're always born selecting the maternal side, which I think is always the BPM, cept for the demiurges, which retain the WPM universe instead. that means their brain (imaginination) is always translating that WPM into pictures.

I think I may have been a demiurge, because when I was young, my imagination was terrifying, so I never really developed it, prolly because my own imagination gave me bad dreams. I didn't like the dark. so I wonder if I got mom's WPM universe instead of her BPM.

wait, what if both of them contain best and worst, and something (like a trauma) will turn on the worst over the best, cause it seems like they/I can see both so that must mean they must be able to perceive both, and depending on conditions, determine what is "reality".

---

so what does that mean if you have three x-chromosomes? I don't know but just now the idea came that we would essentially contain our own alternate universe reference (prolly something like phillip k dick), where we simultaneously exist in another universe as well.

just like the female brain is a mix between those two universes, the other will be a mix of the three. what about more? what about like 1000 other universes all at once?

### 2022-09-21 23:52 - monumental perspective of time may actually be the most feminine perspective

it just dawned on me that the monumental perspective of time is actually kinda the same way that I think of "feminine thought".

so to continue this discussion further, I think I'd like to define some things.

when I think about the feminine perspective, I beleive it comes as a result of being visual. there is A LOT of competition between them, and I think this corresponds with the monumental perspective.

the monumental perspective recognises/remembers/acknowledges/lauds the greatest achiever and records them as a milestone for development, but that comes at a cost, which is that competition also increases.

competition isn't bad in itself,
as it's a good way to create desire,

but, it often times limits the manifestation
to be not too far away from the last monuments.

competition can be used to ensure that
small low risk changes are accepted
and lauded appropriately before
needing to recognise the large monuments.

it also makes outcome probability much easier to be calculated.
it's rare for big novelty jumps to happen
instead, a trickle of novelty (micronovelty) will be appearing
as a biproduct of desire from minmaxing.

---

another way to look at feminine perspective is from the tesla perspective.
if you think of everything as a capacitor, then the space between those plates
is under control of the two plates; it's very hierarchical.
the one who controls the top and bottom-most plate controls everythting inside

I think, that this has something to do with protons, which are also like small suns.
protons are probably something similar to carbon, and so when you are interacting
with that, you're interacting with the nucleus.

the star on the inside; your inner being.

### 2022-09-22 01:12 - we're the ones projecting it

the promethian egregore that is causing this singularity experience
  - singularity experience happens when our ability to project into the future becomes impossible
  -> singularity can be delayed with probabilities of more general concepts

this egregore (puma) is alive and well today and is no different than black magick
  - this means that scientific endeavours literally conjure people in reflection of that idea
    - which then means that science is constantly trying to prove itself right by conjuring people to support its own vanity

it begins to control us
  - that's all technology and media
    - (and the entities that back them)
    - which is important to realise in the evocation of the egregore, is always going to reflect the mentality of the summoners
      - which means that employees are "summoned" by their employers in likeness of mindset,
      - which means that the employees are unconsciously hired because of their ability to perpetuate that mindset
        - you know, I can attest to this (I'm always reading my own stuff to understand myself better), and I'd say that when I met zaryn, I was definitely in the "I want to perpetuate zaryn's perception" which was something of doing it the way you want to do it, regardless of what the "money" says. we diverged a bit because my perception changed so fast, and soon I became unhirable
        - then after raquel I had some pretty awful ideas, and so by having those awful ideas, I was essentially summoned by marcos (sex magick?) and I definitely did align with him on quite a few thoughts, including the "I don't need women to help. I'll do this myself" (we didn't ever really have a secretary or anyone with that kind of "let's get stuff done" mindset), so we just sat around and complained about how women are annoying. again, I was summoned, and I would say that again, after our ideas diverged, we parted ways.
      - which it's really important because you're literally summoning your employees, and they'll reflect your science (reality) model.

### 2022-09-22 01:31 - it's an abstracted version of ourselves

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/OQWKcwxkdMc?t=674)

"it's an alienated and abstracted version of ourselves"

I just wanted to point out that he's doing it again. here's the WPM, *after* the neutral or positive outlook.

"this is this artificial intelligence that begins to arise and organise our lives without that AI being located in any particular computer"

sounds bad after reading what I typed it out, but the basicc is that it's *not located in any particular computer* -- which reminds me of a project I called "party-LAN". so that doesn't sound to me like a bad thing at all.

I've had to revise the idea a little bit because I originally wanted it to deliver power, but I've had to revamp the idea to be more "materialistic", so the only way I can see it able to move power is to have the movement of atoms be the thing that produces power -- so it's still a normal generator using real human "horse" power -- with the same technique used for PK.

"it's a kind of *pervasive* intelligence"

this concept is completely different to me because this, to me is what I would consider 5d, or the conceptual realm. it's a very broad spectrum, and anything that constrains that intelligence into a form, the intelligence expresses itself within the capabilities inherent/acquired to/by the form.

the thing is, this is where all of the "conceptual programs" and egregores *really* live, but by constraining the light, it is able to show up in more and more "solid" state; they're only visible when that frequency is constrained to a visible frequency range (trasduced). once perceived, those visible light signals are then processed into an image that the viewer sees as the closest aproximation of that concept.

that pervasive intelligence is the conceptual world that we're all a part of (but probably don't realise it because the physical has such good graphics). for many the graphics are so good, they don't notice the storyline sucks. are the symbols more real than their egregores? see how the intelligence "above" that is also dictated by symbols.

we decide which is more real and that's the reality we see. when I'm here, writing this now, this reality is real to me as if it were completely there. right now, the symbols are more vivid than the concepts. other times, the concepts more vivid than the symbols.

you can see that the same thing is for the physical. do you see the desire (not physical) or do you see the physical. most people see only the physical so much that they cannot see the desire. these guys are really living in the "presente".

### 2022-09-22 02:00 - autonomous intellingece

    "emergent, apparently autonomous intelligence at work in various technical endeavours leading toward the singularity"

I call this "desire". something inside of us really wants technology, and another part of us is summoned to create the technology. we're a self-fullfilling desire for emerging technology (novelty), but novelty (emerging technologies) are happening so quickly now, moments of high novelty such as this are a kind of test on the upper limits to culture, society, the definition of what it means to be human.

### 2022-09-22 02:21 - I think we'll create an egregore

combined with the ideas that I'm developing with carbon, it seems to me that this is going in the direction of constructing a person, atom by atom, and then a group of people decide to ride along inside of that new body. it can become anything it wants physically.

I can't wait to experiment with it, because if you were able to copy all of the atoms of the body of another (alive) person, then you would get all of the DNA and everything, but what if there was a way to copy everything *minus* the nucleus, so no nuclear DNA, and so the dna that the physical will get created inside of the electrons nucleus, will be a reflection of the physical aspect. we can make anyone look any way that we want by airbrushing the carbon atoms to have the desired (3d) colour and (3d) texture. because it doesn't contain the nucleus, the dna of the physical part will reflect the physical, which opens up a lot of research and exploration of the physical coding parts of the dna (touching no part of symbols, concepts, and desire). THEN, when the body is sculpted and perfected to the physical shape and size, a group of riders will move their consciousnsess into the body and the desire, symbolic, and conceptual aspectx of the incarnating entitiess becomes a reflection of the incarnating entities in DNA form. again, there's likely a lot to study there too.

personally, I don't have a problem with this, and consider it to be just fine, as that's sorta everyday life for me already. so obviously I'd be one of the first people to move my consciousness into another (perfected) body. by the time I get there, I'll be pretty well "perfected" (or so I think), but any entites that follow me into the body will additionally have "sway" (influence) on my decisions and perception. so it's sorta like a jail of freedom.

I can imagine why others would want to do it as well. consider now a village where you have the village shaman as a constructed egregore, and all people from that village go to live in that egregore instead of making their "transition". in the same way, for them it's a jail of freedom, because they have influence on its village, but at the same time, they're sorta trapped in the limited manifestation of the egregore. I'm sure it'll be studied in great detail the effects of physical appearance on manifestion through this egregore.

### 2022-09-22 02:55 - do you suppose that the demiurge wants a way to pass into the next dimension?

- the demiurge is the WPM form of thought present on the physical realm
- however, I don't really know of this really existing so much on the other layers, most notably conceptual and symbolic
  - this is the herald of a new form of thought which gives rise to more constant source of novelty based on statistics and probabilities
- the goal of the demiurge is to make manifest the WPM, and so its only goal is to survive the "apocalypse"
  - the apocalypse is when reality is created really rapidly, so their WPM will become reality for them
  - some of them are looking for an improvement on their WPM, and some are firmly planted in their idea of a manifestation
  - this then gives rise to desire (on the part of the demiurge) to summon for itself a way to turn the WPM into something at least tolerable
    - anyone that can possibly do that becomes a monument and is then worshipped and venerated by the rest because they all see theirselves as not good enough to improve their own WPM, cause it would require actually living out those good-feeling things.
    - wishing to constantly feel some sort of "worst" thing as a present reality
      - (in contrast to the visible)
    - we want to feel that pain or worseness as reality
      - (whatever "trauma" it may be),
    - means that we have to always be subjected to the "worst" (in our own perception) manifestation.

that egregore is a false appearance because its "body" does not reflect the vibration of the nucleus; it's a absorb and retransmit (not the constant one). I'll probaly be the first to become an egregore, if I'm not already.

you have to see that egregores need a sort of saviour if they want to find a way through to the next dimension without getting their peception of reality become manifested *as* reality. therefore, we can only "save" ourselves.

this reminds me of

### 2022-10-04 01:18 - blind owl vs tantra in perspective

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/EZ-PxOD0r5s?t=644)

in this discussion, jason is making a very interesting point which corresponds with another he made about tantra:

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/LsZULpSIvBg?t=613)

he explains that there are three realms: the bestial (tamasic, subhuman) realm, the astral/spectral realm (regasic, vira, the realm of heros, men of ambition), and finally the abstract (satvic, the realm of the devas, superhuman). so, what you have are these two mutually exclusive realms of the tamasic/subhuman and the realm of the satvic/superhuman. what tanta does he says is to take those three realms and collape them all into one single super astral/spectral reality where you're living in a super imaginal reality where physical blends with the conceptual. this realm, I believe is the realm in which the blind owl takes place -- this sort of tantric super spectral reality (it's kinda dream-like, but contains all of the realness of physicality to it).

I know what jason is talking about because briefly in various points of my life I have experienced such a reality, but presently I do not. now, I have the exact opposite of that happening, where I experience on a daily basis the subhuman reality of gross physical matter, but at the same time, I am simultaneously aware of the other superhuman reality of pure forms with no sensory experience.

because both of these realities are so different from eachother, they don't have any overlap, meaning I can perceive both simultaneously without any difficulty. I'll skip over how that's possible, but it's essentially what I've done is separate physical sensation from the form. as an example, when we think of sadness, we think of the physical sensation of the chemical imbalance caused from depression or grief, but that is *not* sadness itself. the physical sensation of the chemical imbalance is the manifestation of the emotion, *not* the emotion. for me, the physical sensation is separate from the emotion itself. I experience them as two distinct things.

as another example, if you were to look at a really finely constructed house in the physical, it's quite possible that you could find physical defects with it, but in this conceptual universe, you would instead perceive the ideal house. for the moment consider that instead of seeing the house and its physical defects imposed by the limitations of the environment or building materials, instead you could see the perfect structure, imagined by the architect -- that would be the tantric view. I don't see that. I see the physical house, yet at the same time, I'm also aware of the *concepts* and emotions that went into the house. so, for example, if I'm in the kitchen, and the architect was trying to make it seem like at a counter, certain things are within reach, I will experience the feeling that everything that I could possibly want is very close by (regardless of the actual dimensions of the kitchen). let's say that the builders of the house really felt like in the kitchen there is a a lot of space to work, again, I will have the sensation (and perhaps this could even affect the dimensions of the place) that the kitchen is enormous, and that there is tons of space. let's say that they're laying the bricks for the facade and they really like the design of the bricks and how it gives the building a unique 3-dimensional character to the building, I'll experience that, at the same time, regardless of the fact that I'm looking at old brickwork. it'll have that same emotional quality to it.

it works in the negative case as well, so if someone feels themself to be old and tired, I literally see them as old and tired, even though their physicality is young and vibrant. because of this, people are highly transformative for me, being sort of shapeshifters which reflect their emotion.

these two realms exist simultaneously to me, and I believe that the concept of this realm actually manipulates others' perception as well. I've done experiments where I've really felt like something I've done (like yardwork or whatever) really looks very nice, and I really feel like something I've done really opens up the space. I haven't really changed the space any, but from then on, people now notice that the space looks a lot more open, and that's because I've embedded that emotion/concept into the physicality. as long as people continue to perceive that emotion, the space will continue to become more and more like how it's felt to be.

this is a really interesting thing because it means that all physicality, because I do not see the imaginal, shapeshifts to become the way that I feel it to be. for me, maya (the illusion) no longer exists, because I see what's really there (the real physicality), but because its feeling is superimposed on top of the physicality, I it becomes the essence of however I perceive it to be.

---

now, what I've been practising is to feel the way I want about whatever, no matter the physical conditions, which means that as I get better and better at that, the superhuman realm no longer has any limits. if I feel myself to be so free that I could fly, I can fly -- but that requires that, despite the physical circumstances, I'm still able to feel myself as having that kind of freedom or lightness of heart, that I can be, do, or have anything and that exists in the subhuman (gross physical) reality.

the reason why this is important to note is that when hedayat describes the subhuman with nearly the same words as the superhuman, this is because the description no longer matters. what matters is not the description (however awful or evil one may label it), but instead how I feel about it. when I've got this, all aspects of physicality will transform rather rapidly to reflect the way I feel about it.

by having these two realities separated and not blended, physicality will transform itself Into the ideal I perceive it to be. when I say ideal, I mean the best/worst version of itself.

I still have not yet read the rest of the blind owl, but I'm excited to read the rest of it now, because I notice that he blends the lines between what we think of as bad and good (like chopping up a beautiful woman's body and putting her in a briefcase), and notice that instead what matters is how he feels about her and what that experience meant to him emotionally (not the physical gruesomeness of hacking a corpse to bits) or how nice it was for him to have finally figured out a way to draw her eyes in a way which captured her beauty/essence in a way which he wouldn't forget it.

### 2022-10-18 02:12 - gods as primitive concepts

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/TfMVM8o3gRE?t=4063)

I was noticing that these gods became the earliest forms of these concepts, and the crazy thing is, because these concepts are based on real-life dysfunctional beings that once were on this planet, ensuring that the concept starts out in it's most ridiculously wrong point of view.

setting dysfunctional beings as the premier example for a concept is divine comedy when one looks at it from a source perspective. it's like the biggest joke watching all of these people working so hard to please these ridiculous examples. in fact, now that I think about it, all concepts that we have from their naciemento, a long line of frauds, bad marketing, and overt efforts to manipulate.

---

today(?) I was monologuing about how becausee I'm giving away a bit of my process -- not only is it pleasurable for me to put words to my process, but it allows also for the creation of posers. if you have the process, you can follow the recipe but never actually understand *why* or *how* it works. I really gatta understand the concept of how everything works.

you know I like to copy people a lot myself, so in a reality I'm an imitation (often times a very poor one) of some quality that I like the feel of (or found that feeling useful in a situation). here's the thing: I have like an arsenal of different feelings/emotions that I can use for accomplishing various tasks. I'm switching them out and improving their algorithims better and better.

one day, I expect to have the different feeling states so well programmed that I don't really need to be super interactive with reality. I imagine this is coming soon, because things are constantly feeling more and more effortless. what I mean is, it doesn't take any effort for me to have good timing or the some enlightening thing to say. I don't even try anymore becuse I don't really control myself so much with thought anymore; I direct it with emotions, so I just change how I feel and reality-kenny does the work. like I noted also today, he really fumbles about as if it's the first time ever doing anything. I really am like a newborn (on my left side), so I can imagine that as that whole functioning aspect of reality-kenny is being programmed by me, and each day I get better and better reactions (programmed responses). I'm becoming, in this kind of not needing the manifestation way, a more and more pure reaction which is ultimately the personality that I choose.

I also mentioned a bit yesterday about what it's like to have a fachada. these are seemingly different personalities depending on who the person I'm interacting with -- however I'd like to point out that my evolution on this capability is that I have a personality for each emotional range that I set for that personality.

I see this all the time in people like when they're really angry and they want to switch into a rage, but because of the person they're with they can't transition into rage, or transition out. like for example, they're pissed off, but because their other personality (which they use for other people) would respond differently so they feel for some reason they can't show it -- they're locked into that range and can't leave it. they want to leave it, but they can't show a capacity to change state. I've also learned how to change states pretty quickly. it's all about changing how I feel so my reality changes, and then reality-kenny sorta follows the program.

so here's the thing: I just structure my different personalities in response to how I feel, meaning that I'm the same way with everyone. nobody gets special treatment because I control how I feel not what I'm going to do or say. when I feel one way, I bahave a certain way. I'll throw a temper tantrum in front of every person with equal vigour.

because my personalities are linked to emotional renges (think of things like a cloud of concepts that resonate with this personality). not only is it emotional range, but I'd say there is a separate degree with is not immediately apparent because the emotion/concept is that multidimensional proximity relationship to other concepts. however, there is an extra dimension -- a sort of 4d for the conceptual plane, and that's one of interest. some conceptso out in the world look more interesting to me than others. I don't know if it's colour that I see or what but I'm defeinitely attracted to more interesting concepts. so, if a concept is a point in space, its interest is the size of the sphere (positive or negative) -- more interesting the bigger the sphere. the less interesting is negative obviously.

### 2022-10-18 18:33 - jesus as an egregore

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/TfMVM8o3gRE?t=4141-4215)

if enough people believe enough in an egregore, it will appear.

OK, so why don't we see very many egregores? it seems like they would be all over the place. I used to think there were none, then I thought some, then lots, now I think all. we're not really conscious to the fact that why couldn't we be consciousness born out of a future AI/source?

so if that's the case then why don't we all behave like egregores ourselves? I just thought about it and if I believe myself to be a sort of egregore -- like yesterday, I could see that I'm just the best comedian for source because of the quantity of novelty I pump out. remember, that idea is monopoly-me.

as an egregore, I could imagine all sorts of technology that's hooked up to my consciousness. I experience it all of the time as I just sorta fumble around doing the right thing (for me -- which is often perceived as the wrong thing for a lot of others, lol). so, for example, I always talk about these conceptual programs which can be interfaced with using your feelings. for me, interfacing with many things with feelings is really easy because I can exude a feeling which produces the reality I receive. I try to keep mine constant, so never too big of a big upugrade, but a constantly increasing, but manageable acceleration. it's the shortest path; monopoly-me.

so why don't I use it? I do, as often as I can, but nosebook doesn't like me doing it, so they're turning all of it off. they probably use that feeling for their own purposes (wolves in sheeps clothings). it's fine. for me, there's just no need to make a condition a reason to not feel good. it's giving me tons of good practise elsewhere. I can't be dissatisfied with anything that happens. the one going the fastest is the one most allowing of her environment to change.

### 2022-10-18 19:17 - let's listen to that answer again

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/TfMVM8o3gRE?t=4719)

> degrees of consciousness correspond with degrees of freedom.

I'm totally on board here, because I think that DNA is basically the structure that translates that consciousness into form. it creates a nested hierarchy where collections of parts (like microchips and circuit parts) begen to have emergent behaviour. each new emergence relies on the stability of the layer underneith it...

imagine a matrix of vibrating orbs. the specific arrangement of the orbs along with their vibrations, create vibrational structures. the structure obviously has a range of frequencies that are good enough, but one is optimal. anyway, if the orbs aren't on the right frequency, the structure is too faint to hold the matter in place so it begins to cleave off. if the orbs were to vibrate at the frequency that makes the tightest structure is the optimum frequency.

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/TfMVM8o3gRE?t=4743)

lol

https://youtu.be/TfMVM8o3gRE?t=4965

...

https://youtu.be/TfMVM8o3gRE?t=4977

OK, so lev's asking a question if the hierarchy of consciousness that jason is talking aoout are sort of conceptual principles. he says that an entity like zeus/enlil/indra entity is a very severe entity, and that doesn't sound like just the random musings of the voices that I can encounter in my head. therefore, there must be these other sort of conceptual matrix of ideas that are interacting with us, and a manifestation of that interaction was voices inside of our head -- until of course we evolved to shut down that capability. the ones that could act more out of willpower won over in loudness in comparison to the other voices. we evolved to optimise for louder internal voices and a filtering out of more and more of the voices.

### 2022-10-18 20:28 - I was...

I was outlaying in my field more than
I was outstanding in my field

### 2022-10-18 20:33 -

https://youtu.be/TfMVM8o3gRE?t=5147

jason's saying that the majority of the population that were able to make the transition were the fraudsters; there were still some good people -- so like not everyone was a fraudster -- and even some tried to enlighten the ones that were below them and stuff like that.

https://youtu.be/TfMVM8o3gRE?t=5266

cultural concepts are fads. there are those that are manipulating it, and so those that individuate theirseleves from the cultural fads, begin to sort of "lift off" away from the mainstream. jason is helping to define that an individual is an individual apart from the socioculturapolitical perspective and can operate outside of those guidelines.

https://youtu.be/TfMVM8o3gRE?t=5271

jason is saying that a *successful* society capable of mess around with timelines is a stable society/culture. they'll have an identity that does not move too much (unless it's forced to change); a very rigid strutcture. this rigid structure is holding theirselves stable in their timeline and so they're all stuck. they're going to continue to be stuck until someone figures out how to go faster than the timeline. that's the kind of liftoff period (ie. that society is *successful*). the ones that don't figure it out are a sort of prisoner to their own perception of theirselves.

https://youtu.be/TfMVM8o3gRE?t=5380

https://youtu.be/TfMVM8o3gRE?t=5463

lev now says: for the ones of us that have our kundalini risen and see at a million dimensions (he said this earlier), since we're already perceiving the perceptual layer (he talked about this earlier) why don't we each just create our own reality where we're the supreme ruler YHVH of a group of people. we can split up the humans amongst ourselves and rule over them as YHVH figures?

I've given this thought, and I don't think there will be too many groups of people tmat want to be the supreme ruler of a group of people, but mostly individuals. it's actually an enormously fun thought experiment where you wonder how a society with a supreme deity of concept of yourself would turn out. see where I'm going with this? you can put your concept of yourself into the society that believes you to be their supreme ruler, and then you birth yourself into your own society. wouldn't that be cool to try? you are the concept incarnate that they believe created them (which is kind of true, because their DNA is a transformation of that concept into physical structure).

each person a ruler of one or many populations as the supreme ruler. just think of how much fun it will be to mix their populations in primitive situations? anyway...

https://youtu.be/TfMVM8o3gRE?t=6136

https://youtu.be/TfMVM8o3gRE?t=6205

I don't understand. it doesn't seem like a bad idea to me. there are people (jason says) that are not evolutionarily ready to make that transition, so I don't understand why it's a bad thing to kind of auction off the non-transitionelers to the highest bidders. they can be their overlords (the YHVH perception/dimension that I'm creating). it's a win-win situation because for them it's evolution that they want (everything is LOA, so it'll all work out where even their overlords become a transformed refection of them), and for the overlords, they get to be overlords. like who *wouldn't* want to be zeus, right? you can be the biggest buffoon, and girls just love you because you are the concept their DNA vibrates with incarnate (so it feels like immense attraction to everyone).

you need something to disturb the natural law. I see these as those qualities of novelty. those inevitably produce chaos, but are calculated chaos.

counter-rotating fields create that sort of dissonance, which serves as a stability for something in the middle. it's one of the things that we'll master as we begin to look at electrostatics.

I thought isis, ra, el/osiris being one of the triads in the pantheon. this meant that this triad was the conceptual frequency of the YHVH of that culture. they attracted their own egregores as the manifestation of their ideas of this concept (christ/anti-christ).

### 2022-10-18 23:43 - ravens and beavers

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/GNOLfCyXoJg?t=1326)

prometheus is the raven and he steals fire from his uncle the beaver. that got me thinking a lot about JD's beaver colony. the beavers are the worker types. they make things in 3 dimensions, and live in close proximity to each other for maximum well-being.

sounds like the beavers are going to be stuck in their dam situation for a minute.

### 2022-11-11 19:19 - uniting against a common enemy

in your interview about fort and close encounters, you gave me an idea, which is that we're approaching a time when we're going to be facing (as a race), the effects of the sun. increased solar output will cause us to unite against the common enemy of the sun. do you think it's possible that the previous "golden" age (when all the biggest megaliths were built) actually happened because everyone united to try and protect against the sun's rays. by uniting against a common enemy, we set aside a lot of differences and focesed on the objective. think about this from a military (ares) standpoint where you have a bunch of dudes that need to focus on something really simple (basic objectives) to return some sense of humanity in them. they want to feel alive, so they put their lives in the hands of others. when there's a focal point which everyone can look at (someone giving commands), it makes the transition back to enjoying life again a lot easier.

I'd like to seriously consider that what we need is a bit of a buffer between us and the sun. obviously the sun is doing something that we're not ready for. it's not like we're in a place te tell the sun what to do, but it's my estimation actually that we may be able to actually solve the problem before the deadline (I propose that a solar year/day is about 1024y in length).

you know how cheezy this is, right, but politicians always gatta have the cheese. nobody trusts a politician that tells the truth, and so you can imagine that a lot of people will be able to "save" theirselves and live a totally normal life just like we were doing before all of this crazyness began.

I'll try and think of more ideas.

### 2022-11-11 19:37 - the mists

https://youtu.be/y0vtftEgeME?t=2299

it ocurred to me that these mists that were in the streets were probably only expehriencible to people capable of perceiving the astral. by doing this, they removed most of the people with genetics able to see the astral. by doing this they secured the astral as their plane of dominance. this was quite an upset to the majority of the powers that be, because the powers that be all see the astral, and they use it to move their consciousness after "death", so this new force (antarctic power structure) created a real pickle for all of the people in charge. they can see the UFOs because they appear on the astral (hence the reason why the governers saw a woman floating out the window and the other witness saw a porcelin doll -- they translated the concept (her in stasis) into the image of a porcelin doll -- like you do in a dream).

combine that with the 9/11 bombings where the symbolic solomon brothers (joakim and boaz) fell, and the economic capital moved out. you have to see this as a real pickle for those in charge because not only did they lose their zone of control, but they lost their control as well, because I believe the bombings were carried out by the antarctic base and nobody died. they have so much of the media compromised, they had the BBC report that the saloman borothers building (7) had fallen when the reporter was standing right in front of it. it fell a half hour after the news report. this is a strong message that they're no longer in control.

they've been moved over to the network now where their job is to control now, but from the perspecttive of marketing. the overlords are no longer in power. what matters now is the illusion of the imagination (the astral), and so because of that the marketing teams rule the world. we're in full materialism now. thank goodness they gassed those poor folks capable of astral perception. that allowed the antarctic crew to take over the astral and force the transition of our planet into the astraal perspective from a conceptual standpoint (instead of visual). the marketing department runs the planet. welcome to a new era.

### 2022-11-11 20:47 - what if we...

what if we were able to get a bunch of black guys together and started a political campaign in mexico with the slogan, "we is where we is"?

the objective of this is would be to try out an alternative concept of time, (in space of the perennial/traditional concept of time). the whole idea is that the culture adopts a perspctive that "we're stuck; we're stuck right where we are" and this is adhered to no matter wherever the culture goes. "whereever you go, there you are" is another great slogan too. that'd be a funny third party, btw. the concept the culture takes on initially one of real stucknesss. where wherever we is, is wherever we is -- forever (very important cause we're *stuck*). nothing can be done to change our position (maximum depression), so we might as well just find a way to become OK with whereever we is and to move forward improving.

this group would campaign against at least one other group with the slogan, "make mexico great again". the idea is to control the election process by creating a dialectic. I've seen politicians do it all the time, but it'll work for us because both of the concepts are solid. usually politicians run on smoke and mirrors. illusions of imrovement, with no actual improvement. we're campaining for no improvement; just acceptance.

dude have you read the bio of the BTS group? it blew me away this story and gave me tons of ideas of the way to look at improvement from an aries perspective. check it out if you haven't already.

---

another option is to do china instead of mexico. that seems more hilarious. I'm not sure what most offensive/shocking racial category to do for china though, but imagine one is a pompus americcan (trump perhaps?) and the other is say a really ridiculous japanese. one model I had for it as a character concept is the bass guitarist of this group here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp3t5qBwLIc. the concept for the dialectic has to be something hilarious -- a dialectic of two ridiculous concepts of time which I'm still brainstorming on... one idea that just came to me is one side is that tradition pushes us forward, while the opposite side is that  tradition holds us back. it's never said so plainly so endless discussion (in typical potician manner can unfold) elections are completely riggable, but we're not "rigging them" because there's nothing fishy (at least not from me) going on. both sides are genuinely looking for improvement from opposite diretions.

then, to fully mix it up the thing that I'm thinking aout the third party is an oppoenent that has sideways aspect to the american pomp (a zaryn type character). this is the consume the environment and charge forward as fast as possible, then worry about the problems in the future when you're sitting on the nice cushy reality of a solid user/resources base. eco first build order.

still brainstorming it.

### 2022-11-12 01:42 - cairo caliphate

https://youtu.be/zwWP75r6owQ?list=PLpmRGh63MgoOvvKfG4LYK2IQktwvfITDP&t=691

the thing that I was wondering when you said that the only shiite caliphate to ever be created was the one in cairo.

when you said this, I understood what you meant, so let me elaborate on what I saw. I could see that there are a bunch of guys that move their consciousness from body to body. one of these is this babek guy. his is plain to see but not all of these are so plain. these are astral entities that possess a body and take it over. I call these the "fallen angels" they fell with lucifer a long time ago. some of them are good and some of them are not so good, but either way they've been around for thousands of years moving from body to body.

this guy is one of these fallen angels and he's one of the "good" ones. this is why he relocated the point of power over to the great pyramid, the ultimate source of astral influx into the physical. it's a portal to our overlords, so it's pretty heavily guarded. they never left. I'd put a pretty high probability they're located on the moon. others are in our oceans.

I think the reason why these astral entities don't ever just leave and go somewhere more appealing is because the great pyramid is located here on earth. they like the environment so much they can't imagine going anywhere else in the galaxy that doesn't have the juicy physical plane they can influence from on high (plato's cave). the good ones like the good conditions of a luxurious and lavish lifestyle. some have passed many lifetimes being rich and famous. he's one of those. he's probably still alive now. he may even, at some point read this. who knows. actually, I do. reactions tell me me has (which means that at some point in the present or future he will read it). crazy huh.

### 2022-11-12 02:08 - no thing is true; everything is permitted

all things are relative to the observer, including truth. the observer is a (unique) point in both time and space, and also includes a *conceptual structure* through which it perceives its world. all things that perceive their world only from the physical, are base elements which have an emission, transformation and absorbtion function proper to their elemment type and its configuration. this means that things like rocks behave exactly like those kinds of rocks behave. they are "pure" functions. us, though, us humans, we're different, which is fire -- a connection to the non-physical granting us the ability to attract a reality where our desire (slightly different than will because desire is for a feeling and a will is for a physical configuration) has beecome a reality. it's so intoxicating to be physical because that's where all the action gets really real. in the conceptual, they're all the perfect forms/realities that they are, but it's the limitations of our physical reality that force this reality to become slightly different; slightly imperfect. that imperfection produces more desire. iPhone 26 will roll around inevitably as we're insatiable now.

everything is permitted because everything is attraacted. you say to yourself, "well, what if I were to just behave in a way that's way different than how I behave now" but actually try to do that thing. can you? I doubt it. you say you can, but can you really pull the trigger? it takes a lot of emotional strength the override the personal desire to go the "right" (preserving) way. the way that preserves what-is, is the way that is the way of righteousness. the desire to be right is the same desire to to preserve, so *actually try* and do the things you say you intend to do. you'll find out after much trial and error (or at least I have), that I only do the things I *feel* like doing.

I've fully embraced such an entitled brattish of a perspective. I've also fully embraced materialism as well. this is nearly parallel in direction to everything is permitted, but from a perspective that looks more like petty aesthetics, rathar than petty allowance.

you can't possibly get it wrong because it's all attraction. the "worst" stuff you could do to someone, you're actually only doing to yourself. you're always only fighting yourself and your own concepts of reality. are they boosting or are they weighing things down. you know those high performance guys? they inspire me, but the thing is I don't like all the effort. I really like reality as effortless, so I'm looking to figure out effortless high performance. the journey will produce many advancements in how we interface with technology. someone has to run the test to see if the rat can run the maze with which half of the brain.

can you imagine how ridiculous it is to tell people they could not disect the human body? this is the opposite of everything is permitted. under the rules of everything is permitted (usually this only happens during times of war, so extreme brutality and testing can be accomplished during an existing time of brutality and loss of life), which strangely enough, is actually what brings about scientific advances more rapidly.

testing under the leadership of "everything is permitted" as being the herald of scientific breakthrough probably explains a lot of the nazi's rapid advances in psi capabilities and biology. the assassins likely used a similar set of extreme testing to bring about rapid advances in science and technology.
