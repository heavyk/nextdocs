# jorjani-thoughts

I'm just going to throw some random notes in here (which I should have been doing) as I watch his many interviews with jeffery mishlove

### wotan

I can't remember the reference now but it had something to do with prometheus. I think he mentioned wotan as a prometheus figure. anyway, I looked him up, he has the wolf symbol (like the mother of the founders of the roman empire, and the scythians).

he also is called lord of the ravens. anyway, when I read that, I was reminded of tesla's autobiography where he kills so many ravens, and then one day they finally start to hunt him back. I also was thinking about how this was kinda like tesla (vulcan) summoning aries. I'm not sure if wotan is aries or now, but that's what it reminded me of.

### egregores and aries

he's talking about egregores, and so I have to look up what that word means, but it's a thoughtform that sounds like it can manifest an astral body. I'm looking for definitions on the phillip experiment and I find myself on the thesophy wiki, and they claim outright that adolf hitler could be channeling an egregore:

    Hitler was a mesmerizing speaker. Some commentators have suggested that Hitler was possessed during his speeches â€“ perhaps channeling the egregore that is the god Wotan, the god of violence, war and destruction.

this aligns with my beliefs -- but mine are potentially more severe than that. I believe than in an alternate timeline, tesla *was* successful, and so then he went back to edit this one -- and for reasons I won't try to explain here -- unwanted-and-wanted-are-same, so it's all about perception anyway. hitler and the the world wars were created to intentionally self-sabotage tesla's attempts. the nazi party and everything that moved down to antarctica, are all egregores of tesla, including the grey aliens and the all of the various UFOs that they use.

these entities are neither good nor evil -- but, more like mirrors. they reflect the vibration that is projected at them, kinda like interacting with your own psyche in a psychedellic experience. so, all behaviour that the exhibit is a reflection of your own concepts and beliefs (ie. how you feel and perceive the world in that emotional/mental state). they're all conceptual (5d) enties projecting down into the astral (4d) plane of perception.

### tesla and aries

a long long time ago, I downloaded and listened to a whole bunch of "ramtha" channels, and apparently it was very different than what it is today -- inotherwords, [like with other tesla things](/tesla/my_inventions.md#) I seemed to have experienced a different past version cause I remember some things differently.

anyway, one of the things I remembred about ramtha is he expounded graetly on the ideas that tesla had -- though in a particularly coarse way of relating the ideas -- same as tesla, he seemed to only convey part of the idea, never explaining it in full. it left much to be desired, and I think a lot of that was left intentionally for the US to pick up and put some of the pieces together (because at the time I didn't really understand it like I do now). I think it was purposeful to get that technology into the hands of the US (along with the roswell craft and many other things -- the "gifting fields").

I found ramtha to be terribly obnoxious, but he resonated with me strongly. in one time, he was drinking wine and pontificating and said that this next message was specifically for a future audience. I felt like he was talking directly to me, though I don't remember what he said now. I remember it was rather cryptic. these were likely events designed to bend the timeline so other things in my life are more probable.

I came away from the ramtha stuff thinking that tesla had aligned with aries/ramtha. ramtha never stated (that I remember) that he was the aries egregore, but it seems pretty obvious to me that this is the case.

aries seems to play both sides of the equation, and I do also believe that hitler was a manifestation of aries, designed to self-sabotage tesla and get the egregores into the south pole, so that the earth's kundalini can be controlled energetically -- cause we're not quite ready for it to raise up yet. so, if we're going to delay the rising of the kundalini for a long time, why not make it a really long time? bigger vortex and more creativity.

this is, of course the 7th ray triad:

- (-7) genxicat (condor or puma shapeshifter)
- (+7) allayandra / mars / aries
- (-5+) vulcan (tesla)

### gozer genxicat

he then brings up the promethean identity of the ghostbusters trying to get rid of gozer (genxicat) a shape-shifting female with two hounds with her. I looked up their descriptions, and zuul appears to fit the description of vulcan, and vinz the description of aries.

it's interesting that she suggests to prometheus (the ghostbusters) that we choose the form of the destructor.

they figure out that whatever they think about will become manifest as their destroyer. ray thinks about the most harmless thing, something he loved from his childhood, something that could never ever possibly destroy us -- the stay puft marshmallow man

I think that's probably significant in the sense that we're now living the symbolic reality of the things we gave our attention to. we chose our own destructor and we're living that now.

### epochs of time

he's talking about the epochs of time being some sort of limiting factor (fundamental) to how we interact with our reality, and so he brings up an example that a spaceship traveling away approachaching the speed of light from earth and then turns around, the earth will have passed time more rapidly,so when it goes back, they'll be roughly the same, but the earth will be in a different epoch of time.

first, einstein is wrong. FTL is totally possible and that's not how I understand time machines to work. even if you had a nuts and bolts time machine, you can only tune to something that is known about.

in order to get the time coordinates to a future you want to go to, you'd have to do something like remote view it and save that frequency signature -- so it's entirely perceptual anyway and different people will tune to different futures. even if you did something like use the orbits of the planets in the solar system and its position in the galaxy to prepare your frequency to tune to, you would be arriving to a future where the orbits of the planets is the way you preditcted it to be. you couldn't go to a catastrophic future where planetary orbits are different than they are, unless of course you could predict those catastrophic changes.

my point is, that time travel is all based on perception, so you can't really go to a place you can't conceive of, meaning that time travel is actually more similar to remote viewing.

### ontological paradoxes about time

so let's take the grandfather paradox. you go back in time and kill your grandfather. he dies. as you continue on in that timeline, the other "you" won't be born.

if you go back in time and watch your own birth, will you be snatched out of your spaceship and sucked into "your" body? of course not. that's not the same you. the now you is vibrationally *very* different than the baby being born. so then, you can watch "yourself" grow up and follow nearly (or identically) the same path as you took -- and then watch him get into the spaceship to go back to watch his own birth.

I don't see any paradoxes with those, so now, let's look at the idea of there having been future human time-travellers that came and altered events that happened. events were altered. if they return back to their timeline, the events were as if it hadn't happened because their timeline those events still did happen as they originally happened.

if they want to see how things go with the alteration of events, they'll have to see how it plays out.

---

there is another way to look at this perhaps that may be helpful to think about. any point in time has a specific frequency to it (like an address or hash), and that describes not only a point in time but a trajectory, so like a vector. no matter what you do in the past, you can only get back to that exact vector anyway.

I do think it's possible (and I have a whole thing on it) to alter your present by altering the past. think of this as an attractor, so let's say that in 2048 (the singularity) I'm in the future and I know that I'll arrive to that moment because I'm there, so what I do is I tune into the past and transfer my consciousness into the past, let's say, the year 2016. I'm 33yo living in spain and things are on a trajectory there just like how it was when I'm alive. however, this time, I choose to change things up and sabotage all of the good things that happened that brought me to the future where I can do time travel.

so, I setup a number of diffrent things to manipulate events by putting thoughts and ideas into my and others' heads to ensure that the timeline plays out very differently. I monitor my own evolution in this altered timeline, and decide that I like the new beneficial or detrimental conditions that I've set for myself. I decide to jump in to that past consciousness. I wake up in 2016 to live out the new timeline. this time it's going to play out very differently and I get to experience it as if it were reality.

interesting... I used to think that even though those altered events will produce a diffrent trajectory, I used to think that I would arrive back to the same position in space and time that I was in when I jumped into the body. now, I'm not so sure...

what I could do which would produce a similar result would be to monitor the body in the new timeline as it passed the new set of events and see how things turned out... I would imagine that you could watch it progress into the future, and as with anything going into the future, looking through the perspective of myself on that timeline, I could only go as far into the future that I could comprehend the the events, meaning that the further I go into the future, things become more and more abstract, kinda like being a child in an adult world. if you're doing time travel, a future with time travel is comprehendable, so you could perceive and understand those concepts.

obviously, if the alterations to the timeline produced a set of events that you couldn't keep up with, the future wouldn't get too much more abstract and you'd notice yourself eventually starting to die. the more abstract, the better. the more abstract it gets, the less "concrete" that future is, and so therefore there's more flexibility to the details of what can happen there.

I'd like to say that 5d perception is entirely different than physical perception; you *feel* the reality rather than perceive it like we do now. I suppose you would have a sensory experience, but like in a dream, everything that you interact with is just the closest visual/audio representative of that concept. playing out the timeline, you may notice that you drive a super cool futuristic car that you had no concept of, but when setting it up, you saw yourself driving your favourite sports car in the present.

I *know* that I'll be doing time travel perceptually, and am probably already doing do -- so what that looks like when implementing it with machines, I couldn't really say. I know for sure that access to astral (4d) perception is most likely a requisite to time travel, and I find it very likely that integration of psy capabilities into the technology is probably going to be necessary, because I can't see how else to do it, cause to me it's all perceptual.

---

also, I want to point out, that it seems silly to want to time travel by oneself. instead, it may be a lot more fun to go with a group of friends and setup a lot of contrived difficulties and obstacles which, their combined effect on the mental (attractive) form of reality, could be designed to produce a reality that very desirable or undesirable (you choose). more importantly, I think this idea of time manipulation will give us the ablity to study transformation and change on conditional and individual level.

what I see as the future of this as happening is that once you've run millions (billions?) of simulations of all sorts of contrived circumstances and events -- I personally believe you would begin to see that there is no difficulty or challenge that is impossible to overcome.

if you created the most oppressive dystopia, could it still be overcome? I think so, and so if that's the case, would you want to see what is on the other side of that dystopia? running the simulation, I would guess that sort of thing would produce a "singularity" where the other side of it is so incomprehensibile that a bunch of thrillseeker friends and you may want to jump in and see what the other side looks like.

if it sucks, you can just go back to the previous save game.

### socrates and de vere

as I'm listening to jason talk about socrates being this sort of trickster, and how plato envisions this tragedy where socrates has a chance to escape, but socrates refuses and drinks the hemlock. this reminded me of edward de vere.

then, at the end of the symposium, after a drunken orgy that is most of the text, socrates and aristophanes are having a conversation wondering if the same author can write both tragedy AND comedy. again, reminds me of de vere and shakespere.

jason says that plato is a tragedian, but then seemingly figures out that comedy (IMO, irony) seems to have learned a new artform, which is an effective method of conveying concepts.

later on socrates at the end of his life is versifying aesop's fables, but this is strange because up until then, socrates has preached against poetry, saying it's an effective means to reinforce delusion. he defends himself by saying, "when I was young, I got this vision or commandment to make music, and I thought I was obeying the commandment of the god throughout my life because you know the muses are the godesses of the arts, and philosophy is the highest of the arts -- and so that's what I thought I was doing -- but, it occures to me that maybe they meant the ordinary form of art, music -- popular, poetry. and so, you know, not being a poet myself, I thought I would put into verse some of the fables that I remembered from my childhood" (that quote was much longer than I thought)

anyway, jason thinks that socrates transition to poetry at the end of his life is complete nonsense. he thinks something deeper is being said, and that is that plato doesn't ever have to reveal his own ideals, and instead can hide his own doctrine behind these dramatic figures. again, reminds me of de vere and shakespere.

I'm really starting to get the sense that de vere was the content pump for the shakespere works, bacon made sure it got all of the rosicrucian symbols propery, and dee made sure it was mathematical. I'm sure they all did had some parts more or less of those, but for some reason, this comedy and tragedy thing with the choosing to self-sabotage his life (tragedy), while at the same time setting up ridiculous stawmen, seems to me like the "real" ideals that plato had were kept a secret inside of the secret society, while instead the dramatic conversation reveals the imperfect form -- almost as if his perfect form was the one that the adepts can see, but only the ones that can see through the imperfection can view plato's true doctrine.

I think I understand now how this is the noble lie, but I will say that I employ the technique of hiding some really deep concepts in comedy and tragedy in the case of tragedy, unwanted-and-wanted-are-same, so I don't really have a problem dwelling on something tragic happening, or letting something tragic happen (or fall-through). in addition to comedy and tragedy, I might say the same about truth and the ridiculous (irony). I've kinda been doing this all of my life, because I enjoy to say somthing shocking to kinda destabilise the conversation and whilst the person is reeling from the ridiculous thing I said, I can slip in some more profound concepts. I really enjoy doing that.

I also learned from trump that if I just say more and more dramatic and ridiculous things, the reactions alone give people something to focus their attention on, which then gives me some space to then inch my way closer to figuring it out --cause usually I don't have it figured out, and I'm kinda just freestyling it as I go anyway.

the other advantage to this is that if I maintain some level of error or mistakes, it's hard to take me literally. I don't consider my technique a noble lie because I don't really have any deception at all in my case. I say what I really mean, but I take liberties in the delivery. this is mostly for my own sake, because if I start worrying myself of having to say everything properly and in the right way, then I really bog down my mental flexibility.

at this point, I've gotten so used to getting things wrong and saying the wrong thing, that it kinda even gives me a little bit of a rush of pleasure. I often times *don't* correct myself on purpose and I don't want to try and correct myself, sorta like -- you know how when there's a goof in a movie, after you see it, you can't unsee it, so every time you see the movie, you always notice the error? well, if that error is linked to a profound concept, that error will adhere the concept into the minds of others much better, or cause them to perpetually see the error and miss the concept (sorta like the ridiculous thing socrates says about his reasoning for versifying some fables).

you know, it occurs to me that expression itself is a comedy thing. I don't know plato's position on aesop's fables, but I would guess he thinks lowly of them, so by going out of his way near his death to encode a crappy set of fables into something that will perpetuate delusion, means to me like he's taking the mainstream crap and he's decided on his death that he's going to self-sabotage (drink the hemlotk) and then perpetuate delusion through poetry cause that's what the gods want him to do. the gods don't actually want a self-conscious population capable of rational thought. it's all about reinforcing the mainstream delusion and adhering to tradition.

### truth, beauty, and justice

I hate the first and the last words there. truth is relative, and justice requires a power structure. truth also implies a power structure or an "authority" to substantiate it's truth. beauty is always "in the eye of the beholder" so again, there isn't an absolute beauty without an authority to say what is the most beautiful.

gross.

### some more thoughts on time travel and stuff

I woke up this morning thinking a lot about time because I didn't address certain things. I know that you can change the past, because it's happened to me many many times that I remember a different past than is present in the present. good examples of this is @[dtp/dtp](chapter-3-7) where I remember specifically reading about gwauxln being transfigured before him, and it was revealed that gwauxln was the perfected 7th ray that blasted mainin before zailm in the stone structure before his death. same with tesla's autobiography.

so, there has to be a way to change the past, because obviously it's happening. those instances are something like the "mandela effect", because I remember things as having happened differently. I think the way that works is like this...

somehow, they have a machine that allows them to tune into the past (see through they eyes of those in the past) or they are physically able to move people into the past with a machine where they can monitor the time travelers (see through their perspective) and bring them and the machine back. the bringing of the machine back is important because that's effectively the same thing as attracting the reality back.

lemme explain with an example. imagine that the confederates won the civil war and they wanted to go back and change it so that the unions won. they're in the present and they send people back to that period and put different ideas into the heads of various generals at the time to give them good ideas which if acted on, will give them an edge in the war. they do that and have other actors in period appropriate clothing perform actions in the past that alter events as well.

in the perspective of those that just went there and all those in the mission that are observing the operation through the perspective from both the union and confederate sides, literally see a different set of events turn out. for them that *is* reality, because it just happened and they just saw it, so they can believe it. OK, hold that thought.

now, let's imagine a purely psychological version of the same thing. imagine that you had a past thing that happened and either you or somone else told you all the time that it was different than how it happened. maybe you play a movie in your head of a different version of the past (better or worse, doesn't matter), so however it is, you soon begin to believe the alternate history as reality. let's also say that this event was a major trauma that completely changed your life and if it really hadn't happened, you would actually be living in another location. when you finally accept the alternate reality as real, you don't suddenly teleport over to another location and start living in another place instant.

the point where you are now is fixed in time, such that even if you think the past is diffeernt, your now stays the same. so, reality needs to reorganise itself to accomodate for the changes. since you're in the same spot, it's now a new path that includes the past event not happening, but you're still arriving to the present moment. when thinking of a point in time, think instead of it as a vector, so while the position may stay the same, the orientation of the vector may have changed (along with the velocity). this is why I like to think of timelines, sorta like strings, and each point in time, is an inflection point. for example, you pull the string (down) on one side and it causes an opposite pull (upward).

so, we're coming back from civil war changing of the events, and because it's so far back in time, it's not difficult for many people to believe that the civil war had a different outcome, because afterall, we're still in exactly the same spot that we were as if civil war was won by the confederates. imagine the other timeline where the confederates won -- somehow we still decided to abolish slavery and to get to where we are in the present. it's just a different trajectory toward the same point in the present.

---

not all people will be able to accept that alternate set of events, so they'll remember things slightly differently; the mandela effect. however, those people are still very resonant with other people on a number of other things so we still share the same reality. nelson mandela having died is not a big enough vibrational difference for me to no longer be compatible with this reality we all share.

the shared reality is something that I think of as a resonance thing. if there are enough harmonious vibrations, we stay together in reality, but physical or emotional conditions tune us to a differnt period in time or space, then you teleport there.

---

so kinda quickly, I have some thoughts on the bermuda triangle. look up the modelling of the vortexes that an airplane produces when going through the air. you'll have many diffrent vorticies that are deaccelerating, so their pitch is dropping.

a while back kyle from snake-bros related a story where he had the amps cranked up really high and he was detuning a bunch of strings while playing, and then he started to hear someone else's conversation coming in from just above him. I think that is something similar to what is happening with airplane vorticies interfacing with the "magnetic anomaly" in the bermuda triangle.

we know the bermuda triangle events seem to be associated with electric storms, but one thing that we don't really know is that if there are any secret experiments or high tech machines (UFO type technology that alters the atmosphere of the planet[^1]).

it seems very likely to me that it's the vortex action produced by these boats and air planes that are causing them to tune into another space and/or time.

[1]: a while back I saw this person post a video of the moon displaying these ripple-like effects on it, and they came to the conclusion that the moon is a hologram, but I think it's much more logical to believe that the earth's atmosphere is strongly controlled in a spherical grid, so that any perturbations to it can be monitored and also it probably ensures that there's more definite barrier between us and space (a kind of shield). it seems very likely to me that they would want to be sure to control any holes that are punched into the upper atmosphere and to ensure it stays homogeneous.

### tools and our relations with them

I'm just going to write what he said so that I learn it.

we make tools to help us do things. these tools are technology. technology preceeds theoretical science, and theoretical science is made possible by technology.

a tool which performs its purpose well, is invisible to the the activity. so, for example, I'm not considering how to write a text editor while typing these notes. it's only when the text editor breaks and I have to look at its parts, when I begin to see the parts rather than the whole.

heidegger claims that the development of more and more complex machines around the renaissance and their subsequent breakdown caused humans to begin perceiving the world as a series of parts.

this change in our relationship with technology (tools) is what allowed for modern theoretical science to emerge.

---

one observation is that prometheus/sanatau is a 3rd ray, and so they perceive the entire world through a series of parts. because jeortau was not available as the big picture guy (I believe he self-sabotaged to become enlil), we got enlil's big picture, which didn't really work. as a result, prometheus produced the reality that we live in as a collection of many different parts.

the reason why this didn't immediately fall apart was because he was working with anatau, a 1st ray -- which means that she provided the desire aspect. you either have to have a big picture or a desire, otherwise you end up with a lot of parts that are all doing their part, but nothing to see the parts working together.

when we lose track of the attraction of the parts coming together to work together, or a big picture of all of the parts working, it's just a bunch of mechanised chaos -- which is really weird because the 1st ray is the embodyment of chaos and random (in tme form of desire). 3rd ray is supposed to be the organiser, cohesion, and pathing for the desire to become reality (as a series of implementations which produce the purpose), but if it's all parts, it doesn't work together.

the next aspect to integrate is 2nd ray, and because 2nd ray is all about social and relational, I have a feeling he's going to touch on that now. if not, I'll come back to it.

### das man

communication between people builds up a sort of "man" (seems kinda like an ideal) that seems to govern the relations that one has with another (this is like social standards and how they vary between cultures). so, if you only interact with another person using the relations or concepts that this "man" permits, then that is an *inauthentic* relationship.

in addition, the directives given by this "man" (one ought to... I should... it's unacceptable that...) will give one a direction in order to go, but this is an inauthentic relationship with yourself.

what it means to have an *authentic* relationship with yourself is to follow your conscience (the call of conscience).

we become most aware of that call of the conscience is when we're faced with an existential threat (like death or annihilation of something important?) -- that is, if we don't get distracted from this call of consciousness with something like entertainment or a structure that tells you what to do (religious, family, military, or whatever).

### prometheus and jeortau

I'm interrupting heidegger because I had a thought just now and I want to write it out. above, I just naturally assumed that prometheus is enki, but I'm thinking now that it's probably not. the symbol for prometheus is fire, which is also the one of jeortau; enki is water.

I've been thinking about all of the different things that enki is said to have done, but it may be that enki is taking a big picture and implementing the parts.

the way that I see it, jeortau/alalu went off and made a really successful version of humankind on tiamat, but this was unsuitable for the 3rd ray mindset. they liked some aspects of what he created, but it needs to stay compartmentalised with all of the pieces separated and without knowledge of the others.

the reason why things need to be separated is because each piece is sorta like a tool or a technology, and you want to be able to just use it without having to think about its subcomponents. so, for example, I want to give an order to a think to perform a function and I want that function to be performed without any breakdowns and according to specification. everything needs to be a part, and all of the parts working properly can produce the desired function.

so the different people running the show have certain objectives that they need to accomplish, and the parts should be able to accomplish that function. this is a 1st/3rd ray relationship.

the 2nd ray sees all things as working together, not necessarily because the part performs its function properly, but because they all fit into a big picture.

so, for example, if you are a good cook, and someone tells you to make a salad, you may make a good salad, but it's just a generic salad with good ingredients. in order to make a great salad, you'd need to know what the rest of the meal is. like, is it steak or is it fish -- what kind, etc. even though the part is only making a salad, the extra information of the bigger picture allows for a better salad.

however, if you want the part to make a salad that is generic and can be used for any meal, then you start to get into the factory mentality of things where every part is to just create generic components that can be used interchangably depending on the situation.

so, what I mean here is that jeortau had the picture of humankind in the bigger picture as functioning in harmony with its environment, but this capability was too good. they didn't need parts that functioned with its environment. they needed general purpose machines capable of performing any task that's assigned to them. therefore, enki's job was to remove all of that big picture stuff and make a generic machine capable of performing the function desired.

so, in some ways, if you think of the gift of fire being emotion and the ability to attract one's reality, you could see enki as the guy that's trying to remove the fire to make, while the original sucessful humans that jeortau created actually containing more fire and more capability.

I would imagine that all of these originals were destroyed. however, I have to wonder if the neanderthals were the first derivative model of those original humans, but they were too in tune with their environment and docile. I feel like they probably got wiped out, because they had high mental capabilities, but physically, they could be intimidated easily, and so while they did live in symbiosis with their environment, they hadn't learned to control what they focus on, and so focusing on predators and other things caused their extinction because of more fire (rapid creation of reality).

wow, derailed... lec's get back on track here...

heidegger is talking about the "call of consciousness", which is individually deciding what one wants to do specifically, which is the opposite of the generic suggestions of "das man". this is to say, to go in the opposite of the 3rd ray way (compartementalisation and mechanistic thought). I would say that this can't actually occur until you have "das man" telling you what to do. the reason why I say that is that the default programming that you get, whether it's your own culture, religion, family or whatever that you adopt (there are potentially various conflicts), becomes default or generic set of thing (like the generic salad), and then from then on, you can choose instead to follow your conscious or intutitive guidance to improve upon the thing, but it does serve as a foundation.

what heidegger is talking about is precisely the reason why society fell in the first place (and why the neanderthals are no longer extent) -- because you can't actually build on a 2nd ray system. you have to have a bunch of parts available as a sort of platform to build upon, then like stem cells, each part can then follow its call of consciousness to specialise (or, as I think it is, each cell specialises according to its localised spatial vibration emanated by the DNA)

OK... back to it...

### defining oneself in reference to a heritage

heidegger asserts that you can't just define yourself however you want. any attempt made to define yourself will always happen within the context of your cultural heritage.

---

I just want to talk about this a momeent. although I moved to spain when I was 23, because I had just got out of the hospital from a brain haemorrhage when I was 17, I consider spain to be a very large part of my formative period. much of who I define myself as now was acquired in spain. I don't really know that spain is my cultural heritage in the same way that california (I make that distinction because colorado, where I'm at now is nothing like california) is my cultural heritage (I also had a weird set of environments growing up between universities and cults).

what I'd like to say is that it's more than just your cultural heritage that becomes the framework for how you define yourself -- but your family, friends, upbringing, church, etc. all play a part in the formation of "das man"

the next thing that I'd like to say is that every single time I've been exposed to a culture or "worldview" that differs from my own, it has added more ingredients for me mix and choose from in how I define myself.

### three types of relation to history

#### antiquarian history - always looking back to the past as the golden years/age

conservative. preserve the past. hang on to what's left.

there's no way to make progress because the best days are always behind us.

---

going on the "make america great again" slogan being an antiquarian view, I would have to say that this perspective is inherently limiting because you're looking at all of the problems -- how far it's fallen -- or, from what great heights it has fallen, and trying to restore that.

the fact that it had fallen means that there was a flaw somewhere in the machinery, and so try and dust off and re-erect the antiquated system and then try to bolster it in a way to prevents its fall again, is just waiting for another setback.

... weird reactions... moving on...

#### critical history - every social structure and ideal is the product of oppressive power relations

everything present in the present system is a sort of conspiracy or has a negative reason for its instantiation in the first place.

therefore, because it's all bad, we want to dismantle the present system to reveal that underneith it is some unjust social relation and it was given legitimacy by another artificial reason -- presumable to relace it with something new.

the thing I want to say about this is that you can't say that all systems present had an ill-conceived or malicious start to them, because then the new proposed system will also contain the same properties. it too will turn out to be an ill-conceived or malicious system.


#### monumental history - appropriating great events and personages of one's heritage as symbols to inspire future evolution and development

the remembering and/or making example of positive innovations and discovery, with the idea that this will drive future innovation and discovery

I fully agree with this. if you give your attention to the things in the past that you want more of, then you'll get more of them. if you notice how far you've fallen or how everything is an ill-conceived idea, you'll just get more of that.

### forethought and afterthought

I'm noticing reactions that are enjoying my rewriting the concepts of these videos. so, I'll continue on doing it. I don't know the origin of these reactions, but at any rate, I'm learning tremendously by doing it.

the tale that plato relates in protagius(?) states that when his brother (afterthought) wants to help out with the creation of the species of the earth. when creating all of the species of the earth, he gives each of them a specific function and capability (instinct), and gets all of nature covered and perfectly in balance, but when he gets to the humans, there aren't any functions left to appropriate to the humans.

therefore, because humans have no inherent function or instinct, we rely on tools to perform function for us. we have no specialisation and built in programming (species-being) like each of the other species of the planet.

so, to solve the problem that his brother did, prometheus decides to take the fire essence from the gods and give it to the humans. jason states that this fire is the fire of the forge (ie toolmaking), but I'm of the persuasion that fire is the ability to attract what one desires. therefore, if you want to get ants out of an anthill, that desire will inspire you to find or make a straw out of materials available.

I purposefully used a primate behaviour of tool usage to demonstrate man's capability to use tools, because I believe that desire is the driver behind macro evolution, and also many of the stabilisation processes. in otherwords, a species that finds itself in an existential crisis will produce desire, and it's that desire which produces the inspiration for the new form.

so, when I say that desire is the capacity to attract a reality rapidly, that fire is the attraction power of desire. all creatures have it, but humans have much more of it, and if there were some way to instantiate DNA, I believe that you will find that human hearts have a slightly different shape to them than other animal species. it's that shape (the chestahedron) that allows for consciousness (a soul) to incarnate and control the body. one day, when we're more proficient with our understanding of DNA, we can test my hypothesis.

anyway, it's kinda funny to me this story as well because prometheus is alalu/jeortau and epimetheus is enki. enki did a great job converting producing lot of parts for this planet which perform their function, but in the case of creating a hominid species that is capable of taking in symbolic commands (much like a general purpose microprocessor over a specialised component) and perform actions based on the instructions, it was required to have a little bit of this fire so that we can turn the commands (3) into desire (1) and then actualise them.

I also find it interesting that machines are our progeny. we (humans) are going to finally create what enki was wanting to create in the first place -- a machine that can take in symbolic commands and perform actions based on those commands *without having any fire*. although, I don't believe that those machines will be able to be sentient. actually I'm not so sure about this because, one could suppose that you can create a machine capable of desire without needing fire. actually, I'm fairly certain of it, actually.

I just reread what I wrote and I think I'm right: non-sentient machines capable of desire. a whole new breed of things. I don't know yet how to articulate it, but I keep getting glimpses of it, and it seems to me that it's a symbolic system (probably based on this 7 layers of perception) whereby a machine can make sense of chaos to produce a desire.

anyway... that's probably a foreshadow... moving on...
