# astroology thoughts

- it'd be cool to have the ability to grab the wheel and turn it by the planet, or the zodiac around it, so I could press on one of the planets, then move it like the hands on a clock to a new position and the time and date would refect that astrology position

- it'd be cool to show resonances, so like the same planet position forwards or backwards in time and see how the other planets move in that planet's perspectve every time the person has a birthday. like, if I want to know what the other planets look like when I move mercury forward one year (in mercury's perspective)

you know making accurate predictions in the future might all be pretty laughable in a few years when the planets are in very strange positions. they can move around. they don't have to be always rotationg the same speed. they can teleport around in their environment just like we do. what that means is, the date won't always correspond with the correct planetary position.

I wonder if that's what "improve the past" means, because those are year resonances. for example, just like 2000-09-11 carried a different frequency than 2001-09-11, and then that continues on with small viwrations each year. we use holidays to try and maintain the vibration of those days with celebration. I wonder if reliving the glory days is better if it's done on the same time and planet position next year exactly.

when the planets are jumping around in position, it's now more like a song than a wind-up.
