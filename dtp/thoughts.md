random thoughts on "A Dweller on Two Planets, by Phylos the Thibetan (Frederick S. Oliver), [1894]"

I'll write them as they come to me...

### weekdays and planes of existence

the datekeeping is a bit different and slightly strange for atlantians:
- week: 11 days
- month: 3 weeks or 33 days
- year: 11 months, 33 weeks, or 363 days

thinking about why we have 7 day weeks and why 7 is such an important number still remains largely a mystery to me (other than the fantastic chestahedron). I wondered if 7 corresponds to planes of existence. there are 7 planes, yet they used a week of 11 days.

I think the egyptians had a 10 day week (which fits 5/10 fingers), which is also one less than the 11 day week.

we're left with a 7 day week which is weird number because it's not based on 5 or 6.

I would think for a 365 rotations per year, one would expect a week of 5 days (73 w/yr), yet instead we have a 7 day week (~52.14 w/yr).

the 7 must be important. there's this other weird bit in the story where the author relates the creation myth of the atlantians (see below). anyway, the genesis creation myth has *6* days of creation, and then a final day of rest (totalling 7).

this may have to do with leap years:
- 365/5 = 73
- 365/6 = 60.83
- 365/7 = 52.12
- 365/8 = 45.625
- 365/9 = 40.55
- 365/10 = 36.5
- 365/11 = 33.18

as you can see, the numbers with decimal parts less than 0.5 are 5, 7, and 11. a number higher than 0.5 means a leap year happens more frequently than every other year.

that's the most obvious and intuitive answer, so it seems that "God" had timekeeping in mind when he rearranged the week into 6+1 days.

I believe there may be a deeper meaning perhaps. I mentioned that I was thinking about the planes of existence. a long time ago, I got this crazy idea that perhaps two more physical layers of reality could be added artificially.

if 5d is looking at yourself from outside in, 6d would be looking at another version of yourself in time or space, well, 7d then we sort of like a group/herd/species of you. up until now, I believe the group consciousness that forms the instinct of various species (morphic fields) exists in the conceptual realm and so therefore isn't really very physical.

I have long postulated that nosebook is and will have to come up with greater and greater techniques to control the flow of human interactions. they pretty likely perceive us from the 5d perspective, as if they're watching from an omnipotent perspective. this is fine for one, couple, or a few people, but doesn't really work for large population groups.

so, just as each layer has its opposite counterpart (concept/structure, imagination/relation, physical/desire), so too did I postulate that these worlds need an opposite one. I can't find the original document, but in another document I wrote called "the-new-earth" (I'll have to look more closely at it), I mention them as:

- desire
- relational
- structure
- (new) thrust
- (new) YHVH
- source
- (new) identity
- (new) temporal
- emotional
- imagination
- physical

the interesting thing there is I have taken the previous 7 layers there and added 4 more making 11 layers.

they were designed to extend the perception of "oneself" out further than previously possible. if 5d is looking at yourself from the outside in, then seeing yourself as a trajectory through time, the next further out you can go is to look at a group of "yourself" as a trajectory through time. that group is what I called "identity" -- a group of characters or identities that you can relate to, identify, understand moving around in time. think of this as species consciousness. their trajectory through time would be perceived as the species "morphic resonance".

it's difficult to really convey this view in words, but if you could pretend that you're writing a movie and you write different charactors into the movie to alter the trajectory (thrust) of the story, then that's what this one is like. the way it looks physically, would be something like a very high definition integrated experience where you can watch and alter the trajectory of the various identities that you have created to interact with other identites.

I can't quite figure out yet how this relates to the atlantians. I thought it had to do with the trees. I originally thought that we're going back to a time similar to the atlantian creation myth -- one where the woman is put into power again and once again we're forbidden this time from eating from the tree of life. in other words, we'll live in very energetic times, but artificially we'll be kept from attaining our "immortality" -- the realisation that we're infinite eternal beings and are artifically being held mortal because the "ascended masters" don't yet believe us to be "ready" for our immortality. lol

### creation myth of the atlantians

- incal (the sun) took on physical form in a male body
- before casting off his physical body, he created the human species, a man and a woman
- he placed women in a higher position of power
- woman disobeyed incal though because she ate from the *tree of life* (genesis says forbade them from eating the tree of the knowledge of good and evil)
- both episodes are similar in that they involve obedience to a "God" and also prohibition a thing.
- Incal tells them that they are to remain mortals
- then, he gives them the impossible task of attaining perfection: "I have said unto my creatures, attain perfection and study it evermore, and such is endless life. But whoso enjoyeth this tree, can not contain self."
- it then says that the woman's desire to attain forbidden pleasures caused the sun to shoot flint balls out and cause an ice age.
- clearly this is a symbolic allegory to the era preceding the atlantian one
- the book also mentions 12ky periods or eras. is the author suggesting that each 12ky period has emphasis on the opposite "tree"?

it seems plainly obvious to me that the atlantian age they were eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. this book describes an unbelievable quantity of laws and regulations which this society is founded on. they identified things that were good (technologies and such) and things that were harmful to society and fixed them. knowing good and evil, they are prevented from eating from the tree of life and gaining immortality.

I believe that the two "trees" are the hemispheres of the brain, so if my supposition is correct, the majority of the world would be left-handed and we'd probably see predominance of right-to-left writing. he describes books and stuff from that era, and if any exist today, none remain available to the public.

handedness may have to do with the orientation of the brain to the sun. if the earth were to flip over or rotate the opposite way, looking at the sun while rising the left and right hemispheres of the sun would be exactly opposite if we rotated opposite.
