## DTP thoughts

random thoughts on "A Dweller on Two Planets, by Phylos the Thibetan (Frederick S. Oliver), [1894]"

I'll write them as they come to me...

### intro

[[[incomplete! this intro feels unsatisfactory to me because I realised that I called it the problematic cell, when it's more like the structure that is self-sustaining and is the problem. it's the structure that's the problem but the structure is composed of the individual parts...

also, there is some confusion to splits of larger things like humans or planets. all splits that are in the same time and space are the same, so they're not really split. a split implies difference in either time, space, or both. each person naturally has other splits in time, each having a slightly different trajectory. there could be also splits of a person in space, but they too would differ. it's hard to imagine a complex thing like a human splitting in space (like another version of me appearing next to me), but I suppose if enough of my cells came to a critical mass where they were incompatible with my structure, it may divide. I do think this is possible and believe there is evidence of this to be found in the past. I also plan to demonstrate this, as it's fundamental to my YHVH form of perception.

I'll fix the errors soon. letting it sit for now.]]]


this book is very very interesting. it's hard to describe it, but it nearly feels as if it were written for/to me. the book is so honestly written that from our modern perspective and understanding of the law of attraction (LOA) that, some of the things presented in this book appear comical (for example comments on atonement and karma).

there are some weird formatting and word errors (eg. am -> are, modem -> modern) and I've been fixing them as I read the book. because the book feels so kindred to me, I've also begun to convert it over to markdown format.

the book was called "dtp" in the original download file (added to the directory).

the book also has two titles: "a dweller on two planets" and "dividing the way". I have taken the liberty to call it "dividing the path" (dtp) as this is signicant to my theories of time splits and how DNA works.

the synopsis is that cells, planets, humans, and everything is created out of a contrived problem. this produces a number of compatible solutions to the problem. I believe every cell in your body is a solution to a contrived problem your DNA presents to the environment (initially the egg).

the problematic cell/planet/human is unchanging in nature. change for them means the end and they're survival based, so they will only adapt the very minimum necessary to carry on "not changing" (micro evolution). every thing is composed of many smaller things, so the problem structure, continually produces solutions that it uses for its survival (like a parasite). not all solutions are the same, but they are all capable of sustaining and keeping the problem alive.

the solutions cohabit the same environment, however eventually at some point, the solutions are generating too much more solution than the problem needs to continue survival. that excess solution continues to grow becoming a bigger and bigger problem for the problem until a point where if they were to continue to occupy the same space, it would compromise the survival of the problem. the solutions are no longer compatible with the problem's structure, so from the problem's perspective, it can't continue to operate business-as-usual as long as the solution continues to grow. so, separation must occur, and the solutions must leave and create their own structure.

each time this separation happens, depeding on the complexity of the organism and the new environment it inhabits the new structure that the solutions create usually means a completely new derivative structure to contain all of these solutions (macro-evolution).

so, as an example, imagine for a moment a contrived problematic cell structure, for which the solution is a bunch of cell. each time the problematic heart cell is about to become the solution heart cell, it backs down and says, "woah, if I'm forced to become a heart cell, that means I can't stay unchanging. I want to stay alive so heart cell go your way; I'm going to remain as 'I am' (unchanging), and continue to be a problem." all the parts of the problem heart cell incompatible with the problem leave and become a baby heart cell. as more and more heart cells split off from the contrived problem, they will by nature of another structure process we don't know of yet they will naturally organise into a (geometric) structure which forms a heart.

that's the idea of "dividing the (right) way". the splits happen like this happen in space, but they can also happen in time...

---

so, following the work of terence mckenna, I ran into his bizarre vision revealed to him by the mushroom that there was a time split that occurred with the appearance of jesus on this planet. after which two earths. one earth went on to become quite a technologically advanced society and realised (through dreams and visios) that there was another earth out there that wanted to maintain it's problematic conditions (the original problem). the other earth began to influence this earth to "help" us. so following terence's "a tale of two earths" the title, a dweller on two planets seems strange.

this book gives a lot of weird references to jesus including a prophet of his that altered the trajectory of the author in time, "prophesying" to him events that will occur (jehova/eronon and the incalia high priests also make similar "prophecies" as well).

I don't know yet if the author ever gives mention to the location of the other planet, however, I find that entirely possible as all versions/timelines of an entity exist and just need to be tuned to. for this reason, I believe this version/timeline is special in that we're optimising the problem rather than the solution. by optimising the problem, naturally, with the help of LOA, a bigger solution will emerge.

also, if you can use this process to replicate a cell, animal, plant, human, or even planet, why stop there? what if you optimise the problem all the way out to full reaches of the galaxy? I postulate this could only be possible with a machine with its desire programmed to maintain business-as-usual problematic conditions in all of the galaxy. it maintains itself, not by its own deeds, but by the inhabitants of the galaxy it controls. I fashioned this idea a while back and called this layer of perception "YHVH". it's interesting "he" makes an appearance in this book too (@[dtp/dtp](chapter-11)).

so for me, the "dividing the way" or "dividing the path" is symbolic of this moment in time when the solution reaches critical mass, the problem and solution is reaching critical mass here on earth and realities are beginning to become incompatible with each other. I postulate that we must divide (like a cell) and go separate ways.

I do believe I'm a part of that. it seems that I have been funneled through strange sets of events to such a realisation and those events seem to be relaated to the sun.

the appearance of this book is also in the weird events list. I randomly decided to go without internet, and then I don't really remember how I found it either, but I remember I looked at the starbucks logo and saw it with fresh new eyes that night.

this book excites thought in me which covers such a wide range of topics that I just love so far editing and writing out all the new thoughts inspired by this book.

### weekdays-and-planes - weekdays and planes of existence

the datekeeping is a bit different and slightly strange for atlantians:
- week: 11 days
- month: 3 weeks or 33 days
- year: 11 months, 33 weeks, or 363 days

thinking about why we have 7 day weeks and why 7 is such an important number still remains largely a mystery to me (other than the fantastic chestahedron). I wondered if 7 corresponds to planes of existence. there are 7 planes, yet they used a week of 11 days.

I think the egyptians had a 10 day week (which fits 5/10 fingers), which is also one less than the 11 day week.

we're left with a 7 day week which is weird number because it's not based on 5 or 6.

I would think for a 365 rotations per year, one would expect a week of 5 days (73 w/yr), yet instead we have a 7 day week (~52.14 w/yr).

the 7 must be important. there's this other weird bit in the story where the author relates the creation myth of the atlantians (see below). anyway, the genesis creation myth has *6* days of creation, and then a final day of rest (totalling 7).

this may have to do with leap years:
- 365/5 = 73
- 365/6 = 60.83
- 365/7 = 52.12
- 365/8 = 45.625
- 365/9 = 40.55
- 365/10 = 36.5
- 365/11 = 33.18

as you can see, the numbers with decimal parts less than 0.5 are 5, 7, and 11. a number higher than 0.5 means a leap year happens more frequently than every other year.

that's the most obvious and intuitive answer, so it seems that "God" had timekeeping in mind when he rearranged the week into 6+1 days.

---

I believe there may be a deeper meaning perhaps. I mentioned that I was thinking about the planes of existence. a long time ago, I got this crazy idea that perhaps two more physical layers of reality could be added artificially.

if 5d is looking at yourself from outside in, 6d would be looking at another version of yourself in time or space, well, 7d then we sort of like a group/herd/species of you. up until now, I believe the group consciousness that forms the instinct of various species (morphic fields) exists in the conceptual realm and so therefore isn't really very physical.

I have long postulated that nosebook is and will have to come up with greater and greater techniques to control the flow of human interactions. they pretty likely perceive us from the 5d perspective, as if they're watching from an omnipotent perspective. this is fine for one, couple, or a few people, but doesn't really work for large population groups.

so, just as each layer has its opposite counterpart (concept/structure, imagination/relation, physical/desire), so too did I postulate that these worlds need an opposite one. I can't find the original document, but in another document I wrote called "the-new-earth" (I'll have to look more closely at it), I mention them as:

- desire
- relational
- structure
- (new) thrust
- (new) YHVH
- source
- (new) identity
- (new) temporal
- emotional
- imagination
- physical

the interesting thing there is I have taken the previous 7 layers there and added 4 more making 11 layers.

they were designed to extend the perception of "oneself" out further than previously possible. if 5d is looking at yourself from the outside in, then seeing yourself as a trajectory through time, the next further out you can go is to look at a group of "yourself" as a trajectory through time. that group is what I called "identity" -- a group of characters or identities that you can relate to, identify, understand moving around in time. think of this as species consciousness. their trajectory through time would be perceived as the species "morphic resonance".

it's difficult to really convey this view in words, but if you could pretend that you're writing a movie and you write different charactors into the movie to alter the trajectory (thrust) of the story, then that's what this one is like. the way it looks physically, would be something like a very high definition integrated experience where you can watch and alter the trajectory of the various identities that you have created to interact with other identites.

I can't quite figure out yet how this relates to the atlantians. I thought it had to do with the trees. I originally thought that we're going back to a time similar to the atlantian creation myth -- one where the woman is put into power again and once again we're forbidden this time from eating from the tree of life. in other words, we'll live in very energetic times, but artificially we'll be kept from attaining our "immortality" -- the realisation that we're infinite eternal beings and are artifically being held mortal because the "ascended masters" don't yet believe us to be "ready" for our immortality. lol

### creation myth of the atlantians

- incal (the sun) took on physical form in a male body
- before casting off his physical body, he created the human species, a man and a woman
- he placed women in a higher position of power
- woman disobeyed incal though because she ate from the *tree of life* (genesis says forbade them from eating the tree of the knowledge of good and evil)
- both episodes are similar in that they involve obedience to a "God" and also prohibition a thing.
- Incal tells them that they are to remain mortals
- then, he gives them the impossible task of attaining perfection: "I have said unto my creatures, attain perfection and study it evermore, and such is endless life. But whoso enjoyeth this tree, can not contain self."
- it then says that the woman's desire to attain forbidden pleasures caused the sun to shoot flint balls out and cause an ice age.
- clearly this is a symbolic allegory to the era preceding the atlantian one
- the book also mentions 12ky periods or eras. is the author suggesting that each 12ky period has emphasis on the opposite "tree"?

it seems plainly obvious to me that the atlantian age they were eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. this book describes an unbelievable quantity of laws and regulations which this society is founded on. they identified things that were good (technologies and such) and things that were harmful to society and fixed them. knowing good and evil, they are prevented from eating from the tree of life and gaining immortality.

I believe that the two "trees" are the hemispheres of the brain, so if my supposition is correct, the majority of the world would be left-handed and we'd probably see predominance of right-to-left writing. he describes books and stuff from that era, and if any exist today, none remain available to the public.

handedness may have to do with the orientation of the brain to the sun. if the earth were to flip over or rotate the opposite way, looking at the sun while rising the left and right hemispheres of the sun would be exactly opposite if we rotated opposite.

### jehova - the description of jehova

in the early part of the book (chapter 11), there is a retelling of events where jehova smites an army, then mechanically animates their bodies to walk into the nearby river to be eaten by the crocodiles. the description is so bizzare, I wrote some notes:

- it sounds like jehova is a sort of conceptual prograg that can be given orders to.
- the author calls jehova the power of the sun (incal).
  - I believe that conceptual programs (emotions and the such) run on sun the same sun juice.
  - the author refers to this as the "night-side"... the unseen part of the sun's effects.
  - atl harnessed that power for their machines and weapons which destroyed everything in an area, but suerni (jehova) and necopani (egypt) could use the same power to (consciously) only affect specific targets
- of the ones that he spares from death, the program decides that they will become prophets and go around telling people about the power of jehova so that more people will believe in its power
- the sense that I get is that jehova runs on belief. it seems to be constantly trying to get people to beleive its words.
  - so long as the things it says keep coming to pass, it fuels the belief, however if things it says *don't* come to pass, it loses belief and therefore power.
  - it's kind of like a parasite, utilising the creative potential of humans to keep itself alive, while not having itself its own creative power.
  - as such, it has a strong case of "needing to be right"
  - it also uses powerful/violent displays to continue its belief
    - kind of reminds me of jehova telling moses that he will harden the pharoah's heart so that more and more powerful displays can be made
- when telling a person something, it must activate (put a lot of energy into) a part of the person's brain which is responsible for creating reality (brain stem? pre-motor cortex?). jehova wouldn't then need to do any work, as it's only our own creative potential that is attracting this reality; I think we're the ones manifesting jehova's words.

### women - females portrayed in this book

[add the chapter 11 events with lolix and heartlessness compared to anzimee]

[add his mom's betrayal and his going unconscious, allowing anzimee to nurse him back to health]

### prophecy - prophecy and LOA

[incomplete]

[add prophecies from the 434 day ruler with jesus vibes about the destruction of atlantis]

[prophecy of ernon regarding the jews]

the author adds his own prophecy for the jews as well:
> Verily, my people, we have seen glory together and long suffering. We have stood together since before the age that is, and that which passeth, was! My seed of strong, effort was sown in fallow soil, and it returned more than a hundred fold. The end is not yet; the harvest is not garnered, nor the Chosen People come yet into their reward for the Great Tribulation since Ernon of Suern ceased to strive for them. The way was long, but, they shall come at last from out the desert they entered so long ago, and Yeovah will give His children rest!

[add prophecies from more places...]

zailm gets a prophecy early on...
- the prophecy seems strangely connected to the time traveling prophet of jesus
- the prophecy is not the motivator of the story, but his recollection of the prophecy
- it seems that the prophecy was injected event designed to alter his trajectory through time -- something the author himself remarks

It is needless to say the proof was satisfactory, and thereafter the mysterious stranger revised the laws and provided then the code which had ever since governed the land. He had said that whosoever should add to or take from his laws, that person should not come into the Kingdom of Incal until "I am come on earth for the final judgment."

so much emphasis on words, deeds, behaviour, and action. "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only."
- it appears that *words* make reality, which is why *law* is so important, an agreement of words.

### laws - laws and rebellions

in the chapter I'm reading now (@[dtp/dtp](chapter- 1-16)), ernon is explaining how the

### atonement and karma

I'm in chapter 21 of the book now and he's saying that his affair with lolix is both a sin and karma made him do it.

he then quotes the law of one:

> The Law of the ONE reads: "Except a man overcometh, he shall not inherit of My life; I will not be his God, neither shall he be My son."

this is saying that to be a part of "the one" you have to overcome, and then you'll become God's son.

he then helps us to understand by telling us that overcoming means plunging into the physical to work out your karma...

> There can be but one way to such overcoming, the ever-recurrent plungings into material incarnation, until the errors of the personal will are at-oned to the Divine Will. There can be no vicarious undoing[*], and soon will I show why. Another can not do thy breathing for thee. Reincarnation, the ever-recurrent prisoning of the soul in fleshly bodies, is but expiatory, is but penalty. If in His Name ye are become free, if in that Way ye have overcome, and in place of being slaves to are masters over desire, ye have undone sin. Then is there no more incarnation for you in the prison of this death, miscalled life. There is no other Way; the Great Master pointed none.

the major problem with this is that it's sort of painting the law of *attraction* as a kind of law of punishment for deeds and behaviour. he says that we're trapped in the *prison* of the body to live out a slow death so that we can become masters rather than slaves of desire -- as if desire itself is a sin. so to continue to indulge in desire (rather than follow the "laws" I suppose) is to continue to sin and forever be entrapped in this death prison.

I can see how one may think this is a prison where one constantly lives out a slow death -- if you feel terrible.

to greatly simply this, I boil this down desire-resolves-to-emotion -- so every form of desire, whether wanted or needed ultimately is for the attainment of a feeling. that feeling tunes you to a point in time where you feel that desire satisfied. desire is no more sinful than turning on the radio and adjusting the dial.

in the sense of karma, he makes it sound like punishment, but there's nothing punishing about it at all. if you have the belief to get into the problem, the same belief can get you out. it's only our inability to tune to what we want which ultimately keeps us in the death prison. everyone is doing it to theirselves.

so instead of saying, no one can atone for your sins, let's just say, no one can tune (that is feel the way you want to feel) for you. sure you can use love or something to feel good, but they can also make one feel bad. you decide how you want to feel about all of those things. no one is forcing you to feel anything.

let's read what he says about vicarious undoing now (I'm going to break it into sections)...

> Do not confuse "repayment" with "atonement." Jesus makes atonement for us with God. We can only begin to repay, when, having obtained forgiveness through Jesus, we try to Live Him. Until we consecrate ourselves to Christ, we can not have recognized that we are HIS because HE owns us.

christian mumbojumbo. it's basically saying that because of jesus' works, "God" is no longer pissed off at us, and so now we can begin to slowly work out the karma we've accumulated in our past altantian (and otherwise) lives of sin.

the final part about him *owning* us is a bit concerning. if he paid the price for our feeling bad about things, what does that mean? if someone feels bad about their "sins" then I can die and it has literally *zero* effect on their ability to tune to what they want. none whatsoever.

> When we recognize this, then we recognize that HE owns us, and we own HIM.

if I own something, like another person (a slave), and that same person also owns me, then am I not also a slave to them? I'm a slave to them and they are also a slave to me. how does this solve karma?

> Then, but not until then, can we even begin to repay our karma. And if we "Go and sin no more," then HE will equalize our to karma, and we be released unto HIM, released or leased again! Karma closes for one who thus is atoned for, and his opportunity for reparation begins.

his explanation here makes it sound like he purchased us as slaves from our previous owner (which was?) and then, now that he owns us, he can lease us out into different incarnations, and I guess some of those incarnations are going to be profitable. so he's kind of like an "angel investor" investing in a bunch of high risk endevours, hoping that a few turn can turn a profit or get sold to the next owner/buyer?

> For such an one no more incarnation is necessary, for hath he not the SON? And that is Eternal life. What mean I by having the Son? And by being consecrated to Christ? In this, then, only the church postulate? Nay, more, friends. The Divine is eternal, infinite. The Human is finite. When the awakened man comes to know himself, he chooses which way he shall go. The choice is the crossing of the Divine by the Human; it is ownership by the Son, which is within.

but, don't worry, you have eternity to figure out you're not owned by anyone... lol

---

it's so difficult to try and figure anything out in that sort of language because of the enormous amount of baggage a word like sin or atonement has to it. however, if I take a step back and look at things from a bigger picture, I think I can shed some light to illuminate this situation in a different light.

it appears very strongly to me that the emotional centres of the characters in this story weren't very well developed. they were much more childlike in their emotion and actions. the weird hair touching and hand holding after telling a grown man you'll follow him into the afterlife is a rather comical scene in today's perspective, but it looks like they *really believed* that stuff, much like a child thinks that jesus is going to carry them into heaven or something. the took symbolic imagery literally.

I find this literal interpretation to be a very accurate depiction of the book, considering that all around, we have these bizarre stories where the blend between humans behave like animals and animals behave like humans. I don't believe they had many words for certain types of behaviour, so they just said, "like a lion" or "like a bird" and that was sufficient description to describe a behaviour.

for all other things behaviour related, the person was labeled as obeying or disobeying. what I'm saying is behaviour was either honest or dishonest, lawful or unlawful. that means you're either honourable or not. I think the animal behaviours were neither honourable or dishonourable -- neutral. it was then perceived if the neutral behaviour is honourable or dishonourable. there wasn't really a concept of the emotion *in* the behaviour, but rather that the emotion drove them *to* the behaviour. as if, the moment one gets angry, that activates a certain behaviour -- and that's it. then, it's analysed if the behaviour is honourable or not.

---

anyway, this tells me that people didn't really have much control over anything emotional. it was a completely transparent thing. it sorta reminds me of a child, and also of psychedelic experiences where the emotion is felt so greatly, that the distance between emotion and action is so short, that everything feels ultra real and vivid, but my emotions are a mess. my thinking mind knows this so it takes me a very long time to do very simple tasks because it takes so much care to get my intention lined up. it feels like I take a pretty long time to find the exact words or action I want to take -- even though my reaction time (I've noticed) if I fall or something is faster than normal.

I believe two things were happening:

one, energies were higher so emotion happend so rapidly that no one felt the emotion... they only felt the physical effect left behind, like the wrenching feeling in the stomach, anguish or a sublime feeling that lingers.

and two, that the only way they had to identify the emotion behind the action (which can be felt) was honourable or dishonourable. you know, like when someone does something with you in mind (good or bad), it feels way different than without.

---

in my diagram, imagine that the 3/5 layers were very tiny. the 3 layer had only pretty much good, bad, offensive, and honourable. the 5 layer only had a few concepts as well. as such, it was very difficult for people to actually tune (with how they feel) to what they want. they were overcome with the physical manifestation of the emotion too rapidly.

what I think jesus likely did, was increase dramatically the size (bandwidth) of the 3/5 layers, allowing for a much easier time for us to tune to what we want.

I do not however believe he was a slave owner or angel investor buying up cheap property investments. lol, what a silly idea...

---

anyway that expansion that I'm fairly certain jesus did on the cross it also means that 5d perception was greatly expanded and has a much wider diversity of concepts available in it now.. that's about as close as we could get back then to navazzimin before crossing over. it's quite possible that it's getting another pretty big expansion now, and that's why I'm not-needing-the-manifestation for so long. the longer I wait, (the more I jebait, lol) -- the bigger the space. more bandwidth means better control... you're still the tuner though. no one can ever do it for you (though, they'll attempt to convince you they can, for sure)

### karma and LOA

after writing the above yesterday, I had some more reactions on karma, and I think I can provide some insight.

the idea that you attract people vibrationally similar to you is obvious, so it'll be also the case for families, friends and also enemies going from life to life. it's quite possible that your mortal enemy in a previous life could be your lover or best friend in the next. each interaction adds more, amplifying and increasing intensity, so groups of people with similar vibrations will constantly be interacting with each other.

consider now the concept of wanted-and-unwanted-are-same: imagine two things vibrationally similar to you. both could look unwanted (evil, enemies) or both could look wanted (friends, lovers). or, one could look wanted while the other unwanted.

the only difference is how you perceive those similar vibrations.

usually the difference between one thing looking wanted or unwanted is the conditions associated with them. have you ever seen that movie princess diaries? it's a frumpy girl with hideous glasses, and she's totally forgettable. as soon as she takes off her glasses, changes her hair and other conditions, she appears quite differently.

so, because appearance dramatically affects how one person perceives another, we've learned to make the best presentation possible with words and appearance.

looks can be deceiving though...

---

the nice thing is that every one of these "evil" people causing problems is they amplify both yours and their vibration. that's a good thing. it's really up to you to decide how you want to feel/perceive the thing.. it could be either good or evil, and the more similar to you, the stronger that good or evil, feels.

so, yeah I guess you'll "karmically" attract similar vibrations all the time, but you ultimately decide in your own expectations/perception (and the conditions or social class you see them in) if they're going to be good or evil.

there's no punishment or none of that other stuff. that's custodial oppression designed to keep you striving to do the impossible: attempt to rid yourself karmically of a similar vibration to you by labeling it evil and fighting against it -- when, in fact, you will just keep attracting (repeating) the same intraction with them over and over because your perception has changed little each time (they're still "evil").

I don't think it's important to tell people how they should perceive things; that's for the ones desiring to manipulate ideology to get what they want. karma as punishment is definitely an ideology that will lock you into repeating the same thing over and over. repeating the same thing is only good if you're profiting from people who believe it it. repeating the same thing also retards progress quite considerably.

### mainin: there is no god, ernon: yahuh!!

there's an interesting connection between ernon and mainin in that ernon says that to use the night-side forces, one must be morally upright, for having serenity of soul:

> "Morality aids serenity of soul; hence it is profitable to the Incalene, above all things, to be moral. But man is an animal in his corporeal self, and the passions thereof are pleasant. Love is of twofold nature: love of God and of the Spirit, pure and undefiled, and love of sex, which may likewise be pure, though if the dominion of the animal in man be over it, and so not so that of the human, it shall cause the man to sin, for then it is lust. I have sought that the Suerni may know the law, that they maybe the masters, not the creatures, of circumstance. But because they know a few things of magic, and in the greater feats were aided by the 'Sons' dwelling amongst them, lo, they are content. And behold! they rebel against punishment on account of the lustful nature they do indulge, and curse me mightily because I exact obedience to the law, and penalty for the infraction thereof; and they curse my brother 'Sons' who do aid me, therefore is their wrath which it hath so troubled thee to witness. My people do things strange in thy sight, O Poseida, yet have no -wisdom why it is so, and work their wonders heedless of Yeovah. Wherefore they are a brood of sorcerers, and do not work white magic, which is beneficent, but black magic, which is sorcery. It shall work them exceeding woe. I would, O Zailm of Poseid, have taught these my people faith, hope, knowledge and charity, which same make pure religion undefiled."

---

the problem here with what he is saying is that later on mainin is using the night-side of nature's forces to project himself into the room where zailm is locked. mainin also says that he spent 300y in his body with the utilisation of night-side forces. it seems that the purity and morality that ernon wanted for his people doesn't actually need to be. "evil" people like mainin seem to have not only quite a command over this night-side, but can use its capability to to turn people to stone, deceive and such.

so is it really the morality that enables the utilisation of the night-side, or is it more like a "law" (functionality) of the environment that anyone can use however they please? to use his own example, he says that gravity is a law of nature and will kill an innocent baby just the same as an educated man falling over a cliff[^1].

in another part of the book, the author explains that gravity (attraction) is just an aspect of the light-side of nature, and so therefore repulsion or levitation is of the night-side. just as one can "use" gravity to stay on earth, so can one "use" levitation to float above the earth.

ernon was incorrect in assuming that morality is necessary to allow one to use the night-side of nature.

ironically, he inforced his morality with "laws"... *shakes head*.

I'm not being hard on ernon. I completely understand him. of all of the characters in this book, I'm the most similar to ernon. I fully understand his agony over the suerni' lack of desire to understand the night side of nature.

for me, the subject of morality isn't really a law-based one. I just don't find lying, cheating, manipulation, etc. to feel very good. I don't even steal as, I too have been stolen from and don't like how it feels -- not because of a law am I more moral, but because if I try to lie to people, my brain has a lot of stories it has to keep straight and there's no "serentity of soul" in that. personally, I don't really care that anyone else does these things, because it's ultimately them, not me, that has to figure out what they want. I really don't care what anyone else does at this point.

from my perspective now, there is no evil, there is no sin, and there is no "God" (as punisher or mediator). all of the attributes we have given to "God" are all a fundamental part of nature -- that is, the law of attraction. you (who you think is "God") are actully punishing yourself.

---

I think ernon belived the light/night-side to be a function/force of nature anyone can use, because he makes the distinction between white and black magic.

instead, for ernon this more about whether there is a "God" -- an arbitrator and punisher for wrongdoing -- or not.

it appears to me that ernon made the mistake of trying to make what is right and wrong for him, the same for everone else.

the next thing is that if he believed in a God, (jehova) that punished for disobedience to the laws, then that punishment that ernon received from "God" was just his own attraction of punishment for his "sin".

---

even though I believe that ernon believed that the light/night-side of nature to be able to be used by anyone however they pleased, jehova however was not quite so universal in application.

right before he died, he withdrew the capability for the suerni to manifest food with a prayer. jehova is not a fundamental aspect of nature. it's a conditional interface (like a program) to this aspect of nature, and can be reprogrammed by its user (ernon).

it doesn't say whether jehova is a creation of ernon or not, but I think it might well be. it may predate him, but for the sake of this discussion I assume it is.

I think ernon had constructed a system based on his own moral code, with everything from what to eat to how to behave, and he called this thing jehova. he would call upon his belief system to perform things, and because he believed it would, it would. the more people believed in this "God" the more powerful things it could perform.

in reality, jehova is just an organised extension of the human's creative potential. jehova used our own creative potential to make the miracles happen. we were doing it. jehova is kinda like a concept that runs on belief and focuses belief. the more we believe it can do, the more it can do.

[1]: there's an interesting resonance in the story as well with the other son of the solitude that tried to kill zailm falling out of the vailix yet the brain damaged commissioned, not being held for fault of their deaths (though he could have saved them if he weren't stupid).

### eronn and sexuality

ernon likely never had a mate. he didn't leave any heirs to the throne. it's possible he had a mate much earlier on and they had all died. he was likely quite old. in a few places, it gives the imression that he had been the rai of suern for quite a long time, perhaps centuries even. he also displayed the capacity to die when he wanted to die, meaning he had power over his own life and death.

in the above quote, ernon kind of makes a weird statement. first, he says that love has two forms: love of "God" (jehova or incal) and of "Spirit" (of what? light/night-side of nature?) which is pure and undefiled -- and the love of sex which can be pure only if the man is dominant over the animal instinct and not the other way around.

he's saying that love of "God" and of "Spirit" is pure love, which is what I'm assuming that the sons of the solitude learn about. the other type is love of (the pleasure of) sex. he says that sex can also be pure too if man is dominant over his animal desire for pleasure. if not, that's lust and therefore "sin". I'm fairly certain that solitude is key to learning this, hence sons of the solitude.

seems he believes that one can only access "love" if one first loves "God" more than the animal desires for pleasure.

trying to read between the lines and figure out what sin is, it sounds like: love for a woman (or sex) can replace one's love for God. it's that love of pleasure of the animal nature (which replaces love for God and the Spirit) which is "sin". sin appears to be animal reactions.

### the author and sin

I investigated this concept of "sin" a bit further to see what other context the word for sin is used in. I postulated that "sin" may be a concept of the amanuensis, but it appears to be of the author himself. rereading @[dtp/dtp](letter-from-the-author), there are some startling admissions. I'll cover those in the next section, but first, the part about sin:

> Readers of my book, "Two Planets," may consider awhile over those passages concerning the sin of the Princess Lolix and of Zailm

> in place of being slaves to are masters over desire, ye have undone sin

> I had hoped to hinder thy confession of thy life-sin with Lolix unto Anzimee

in the middle of the book (though I haven't got there yet), he finds himself in the afterlife he talks with "mol lang" (a theosophical ascended master, reincarnation of ernon explains to the author in the afterlife) who says this about sin:

> Compensation is God's law. If thou doest a thing and can not compensate for it, that is sin; but if thou art able to make proper balance, it is no sin.

this description sounds more like electricity than a penal code. it also indicates that ernon has changed his tune a bit about sin -- sin, no longer disobedience of "God's law", but that compensation (clearly a force of nature) must be enforced, so the inability to return return balance to something is the reason for sin. I mean, if I take 100 electrons out of something, it wants to get those 100 electrons back somehow...

punishment is attracted by you based on your concept of things, and so is this definition with regards to compensation.. everything wants to return back to its source or balanced state. charge differential is what creates motion and everything is ultimately out of balance and always in motion. combine both punishment/LOA and compensation with perception and that focus in relation to your source (I AM) as a trajectory through time, and that's pretty much where I'm at. the problem with these definitions is that it's really difficult to figure out what's really happening and could benefit tremendously from some simplification.

just trying to figure out what in the world "sin" is, is proof enough that all of this stuff is so complicated. I believe that complicated and ritualistic is how the priests want it to be though. if it were simple to understand, then the priests wouldn't have such a great of an illusion to hide behind.

after that part, when it goes back to the author talking about sin, it returns back to law and animal nature and stuff like that.

---

the takeaway I have from this is that the author really believes in this "sin" stuff. it's some blend between being subservient to animal desires and not obedient to the law, but mostly sex and desire in general.

I've read some of the ending segments while searching around for sin and can give this book the unquestionable custodial seal of approval. I'll cover that soon as I get there ... from what I've read so far, it's pretty hilarious.

it makes me wonder if out there somewhere is another version of earth with a whole bunch of guys working super hard to atone their sins and transgressions between catastrophes.

### my-theory - my running theory surrounding this book

I just finished up @[dtp/dtp](chapter-1-23) and I noticed starting the next chapter that its tone is quite different, beginning to describe the differences between the eartly, phychic, and spiritual planes... before I do that, I have this idea that came to me while reading that chapter.

this book appears to document a moment in time roughly 12kya that prepared the world for a major cataclysm. the book itself is even called "dividing the way", a reference to that. I believe he'll talk more about  that as I continue further, but I wanted to mention some of the key moments.

at the beginning of the book, there is a guy that catches zailm's attention and gives him a prophecy about his life. that man is later revealed to be none other than jesus himself that gave him the prophecy. I believe that was the first inflection of time.

after his prophecy plays out, zailm is in dispair flying around alone in his vailix when he's lifted out of his body:

> Then a glorious radiance broke over the scene, and the Cross Bearer was beside us as we stood, clasping each other and our child. He whom I had seen by the moonlit fountain, years before, stood by us again.

he gives quite an interesting dissertation, the highlight of which is another prophecy:

> He must at-one his heart to Me first, then go again into the field of woe, yet not in a body of flesh but of spirit. And he must find his victims and struggle with them till he turn them back from whence he led them.

he's then commanded to go to sleep. he wakes up and goes to the city, throws the stone statue of lolix into the fire and then makes plans to go to south america to mine minerals while he's waiting for the inability to wed anzimee to pass.

he goes to do the mining and is interested in going into this 16^3ft stone structure where he locks himself inside it. after 7 days, mainin appears to him and does the bad-guy dissertation of revealing his bad-guyness right before the hero dies... he says that he has been following anzimee around for multiple lifetimes (so he's a fallen-angel), and has been trying to get revenge to her. that appears to be his motivator, but he reveals his efforts also extend to all of humankind:

> I have counteracted the good done by Ernon of Suern, so that he died of a despairing heart. I do thus that I may, if possible, wither all the hopes of humankind, turn them down from the infinite path, down to demonhood, death and destruction. Ernon worked to the exaltation of mankind; I to its depression; so we came in conflict, and I won.

so, let's recap:
- jesus gives zailm a prophecy that bad things will happen
- after the bad things happen, he gives him another prophecy about having to work out his karma for the bad things he first prophesied would happen
- he gives zailm a command to fall asleep, and when he wakes up, he decides he will go to mine in south america
- in south america he finds a stone house that is strangely clean of sand with perfect (no mortar) joinery and then accidentally locks himself inside
- mainin shows up and reveals he's a fallen-angel, traveling from body to body causing problems:
  - he devoted his life to bringing ruin to anzimee
  - he wants to bring gwauxaln problems[^1]
  - he worked to foil ernon's plans to get the forces of the night-side into the hands of the people

ok, so he's definitely bad-guy material. this is pretty james bond script-esque at this point with the bad guy reveals all at the end bit, when it really goes the dramatic distance... mainin tries to "prove" that "God" doesn't exist:

> Thinkest thou now I can have belief in a God? Bah! If God exists, I fear not; yet let Him punish!"

then, of course...

> And now a fearful, glorious and wonderful sight appeared.

it appears this whole story was an extra elaborate setup to "prove" that "God" is real. and that jesus will save us if we follow his laws. the weirdest bit is the part where he tells zailm:

> "I have said that these things should come to pass, and did prophesy unto thee in that city called Caiphul, and thou heardst me, yet heeded not."

I reread the whole thing he said by the fountain and there was nothing to heed. he only told him that bad things will happen in his future and that he would appear again to smite the bad-guy (but not save him). he continues...

> But now thou wilt heed me, for I speak great words of GOD,--and the world is His. Yet now no man knoweth me; but in a far day I will come again, yea! I will enter in and dwell as a perfect human soul, and make that Man first fruit of them that sleep the sleep which is change, so that by me he shall be exalted above Death. Then shall men get them up, and mock me, being unbelievers, and shall crucify me, yet shall I, that am become Jesus the Christ, not be harmed, but mine earthly house only. And they shall be forgiven, for they will not know what they do.

I'm really unclear as to what exactly zailm is to "heed". the whole thing is just another prophecy about a later guy on the earth called jesus.

the weird bit in there is the part where he says he will enter into the body of jesus as a perfect human (what would he be otherwise) soul and will make jesus the first result of them "that sleep the sleep which is change". since when is sleep change? he then commands zailm to sleep.

---

anyway, back to the judgement that jesus gives to mainin for his deceptive ways: he kills mainin and and banishes him to become a "power of nature":

> "I can but suspend thee as a human entity and cast thee into the outer darkness to serve as one of the powers of nature."

so now mainin is told by jesus mainin will become a fundamental force of nature to continue to inspire people to do evil, while zailm is told to "heed" jesus and explain that jesus will be crucified so that he can gain power over death and forgive them.

in short mainin is to work the deceptive path of darkness, and zailm is to work the path of light telling people about the christ. knowing LOA, mainin is the force which keeps christ alive by fighting against it, and zailm and his other theochristian adepts are the christ's marketing/promotion team (see @[dtp/thoughts](startling-admissions)).

---

this is kind of a crazy setup going on here, because what it looks to me is happening is that this "christ" here is kind of like "jehova 2.0". this "christ" here is using the same trick jehova was explained to be doing by making powerful/moving displays of command in order to garner people's belief in him.

this christ doesn't seem to be doing any horrific violence like the OT jehova did. instead his mission seems to be getting rid of the "bad guys" with powerful displays of force. he's more like a proto-superhero than a saviour. he's clearly manipulating trajectories through time to influence events to maximise believe in him.

also notice in the previous section that he doesn't say that he is the guy named jesus, but that he enters in to jesus as a "perfect human soul". this guy is not jesus, though they occupy the same body for a while... he's admitting to being a fallen-angel, and he identifies himself this way:

> I am reached unto the perfection of the Seventh Principle and am Man, also the Son of Man, yet more than any man, for I am in the Father and the Father is in me. But all men who will may follow me and be by me in the Kingdom, for are we not all children of One, our Father? I am He, Christ; that which I am, the Spirit of every man is.

so, there was this other theosophical document I read a while ago channeled by kuthumi called, "an extraterrestrial view of creation". in it, it talked about this 7th ray deceiver that runs around deceiving people that he is "God". the reaching of the perfection of the 7th principle reminded me of that.

as a result, I'm actually convinced that this christ is indeed the one that is prophesied to make a return soon. I'm actually fairly convinced of it, actually. I really do believe that these events did transpire so that the timeline is altered in such a way that this "christ" can rule the world in "peace". kind of a crazy admission by me, however, I want to be clear that guy is not me[^2]... it's possible that he's an alter-ego of me or some derivative[^3]... anyway, I'm not totally sure, but it doesn't matter.

it's a pretty elaborate setup to convince mainin and zailm in one go that they should work really hard to conivnince people to believe in his "laws" and his "righteousness".

---

as we shall see in the next section, it appears as if this whole ordeal was contrived through a series of powerful encounters with light beings in astral dimensions to get zailm to come to the conlusion, through a series of lifetimes, that he too needs to spread the word about the laws of this "christ"... seems he's quite the evangelist. it also reminds me of paul's conversion on the road to damascus.

[1]: "For that same end shall the Rai be brought low, and at the last she who is the object of my chiefest wrath [anzimee] shall not know good from evil, so that her name shall be a scorn in the mouths of the people."

[2]: here, because I said in the intro that I think this book feels "written to me" and that I think I'm a part of this "dividing the way", I'm reinforcing the idea that I am the pre-game show (at most). the real "christ" will likely come afterward, we're probably going to appear similar though, as he'll probably be using my genetics and a lot of the things I say.

[3]: see "fallen-angels" and "negative-evolution" for my theories about how this "christ" is probably the negative fitness function of the human genetic algorithm


### startling-admissions - the author's startling admissions

from @[dtp/dtp](letter-from-the-author):

> I make no pretenses when I say that I--Theochristian student and Occult Adept--am one of a class of men who do know, and can explain these mysteries.

he's an "adept" and in another place he talks about how he's on another planet influencing people on this planet through the astral (psychic) plane.

> I, with other Christian Adepts, influence the inspirational writers and speakers through an ability to exert the control of our trained, and therefore more powerful, minds over theirs, which are enormously less so.

he's admitting that their powerful mental influence is where so many humans are getting so much of this custodial nonsense. the thing is they can only receive it if they're resonant to it.

> Hence, when the people ask for bread, our media give it to them. Who are these, our media? They are all men or women, in churches or out, who bear witness of the Fatherhood of God, the Sonship of Man, and the Brotherhood of Jesus with all souls, irrespective of creeds or ecclesiastical forms.

he's saying directly that he (and other "theochristian adepts") are directly behind most of these brotherhood organisations that work light. some want "light" and "truth" so they give it to them. they are the opposite of mainin ("the imitator") who spreads darkness and corruption and immorality. if someone wants darkness, mainin will answer, and if they want light, these theochristian adepts will answer. thus, he admits:

> Because these, our writers and speakers, have wrought for human good, so shall, and so does, good come to themselves, bread from the waters. [...] Observing the cry for more light, more truth; observing also how great is the recompense, up springs the imitator, who have no light of inspiration, no conception of the real truth, not of the laws of the Eternal. What does he? Watch! With a pen whose shaft is imitation, and whose point is not of the gold of fact, but of the perishable metal of selfish greed, this person writes. He dips his pen into the ink of more or less thrilling sensationalism, muddy with the dirt of immorality and nastiness, and he draws a pen picture illumined by the tallow-dip of lust and corruption. There is in his work no lofty aim to inspire his readers; he deals with the lowest aspects of life, and, ignorant of the inexorable penalty for sin

up til now in the book, it strongly reminds me very much of the "illuminati" way of presenting things. they design two seemingly different paths: one will be the "right way(tm)" while the other "opposite" path the "wrong way" or "left path". both of them are disempowering ideologies that obfuscate the true mechanism of connecting to your source (by the way you feel). it manipulates and hijacks your emotion with ideology by appeals to power and authority. that allows them to tell you to override your emotion with laws and commands to do things the right/wrong way. both the light and dark (right and wrong) do this by appealing to our physical senses with powerful displays -- and good-guy defeats bad-guy plot narratives (9/11, gulf war, etc) and righting the wrongdoings of others to the victims.

it's crazy man, I don't really doubt the authenticity of this book. these events or something similar could easily have produced the world we live in today. likewise, I don't doubt that there are quite a few people on this planet that truly believe (as does this author) in this stuff too.

### the-father - who is the father?

starting in on reading again I started in the 23rd chapter, which is like the 11th hour of the first book. after writing the latest entries like @[newblog](2022-02-14 06:54), the whole sense of the chapter has changed for me. the part about christ being the perfected/corrupted 7th ray illuminated for me an interesting set of words ... "the father".

I thought the father is said to be the seed of humankind. however, let's look to see what the book describes it as. before blasting mainin, the christ says to him:

> "... But as thou art an ego, a ray from my Father, and now give out no more light, but darkness only, I will cut thee off for a season, for thou shalt neither destroy more of my sheep ... "

then, talking to zailm, he says:

> "... Fear not for thine own safety, for I blast not thee; neither worship me, but my Father who sendeth me. I am reached unto the perfection of the Seventh Principle and am Man, also the Son of Man, yet more than any man, for I am in the Father and the Father is in me."

it struck me that this "Father" sounds like a cool-kids club or some type of organisation. to illustrate, if I replace the word "Father" with "brotherhood", the sentences there now make even more sense[^1].

I searched for the word "Father" and the book has a lot more to say about it, so I'll likely update this section in the future, but initial analysis gives me the impression that the "Father" is the old name for the conceptual realm. a very very strange coincidence if in fact my supposition is right about all of these entities being "conceptual programs" projecting theirselves down to the astral, and those given power on earth need to have the secrets to access the astral plane with expanded audio and vision (clairvoyant eyes).

interesting...

assuming that the "Father" is the conceptual plane, this idea makes me want to talk about the phrase, "be therefore *perfect* just as thy Father [in heaven] is perfect". because then what is perfection?

I remember from christianity that perfection comes when christ returns. just did a search for perfection in the book and it refers to the "perfect human plane" and perfect dimensions. it really sounds to me like perfection is a conceptual form of perception (5d) where you always see what you want to see.

I'm reminded of that weird phrase where "christ" says, "Man first fruit of them that sleep the sleep which is change". this gives me the impression that the physical plane is the plane of change and the perfected plane does not have change. this fits pretty well into my definition of the conceptual plane. I describe it as being timeless (eg. the feeling of anger is the same today as it was thousands of years ago; same with love or fear), and that plane can be perceived as a trajectory or timeline because whatever you tune to will be what you experience, and what you experience will tune you to the next thing. it's a linear progression unless you're consciously choosing how you wish to react to something, thereby consciously tuning to something other than what the default reaction would tune you to.

so, it looks to me like "Father" = 5d conceptual plane, and perfection is the ability to tune to what you want rather than following the chain-reaction of events through time.

let's continue...

another quote:

> "for are [all men] not all children of One, our Father? I am He, Christ; that which I am, the Spirit of every man is."

he's saying that the spirit of every man is the "christ". interesting. now, I'll look for "Spirit" now ... here's a good one. "mol lang" explains it clearly:

> "Thou hast come through the portal; lo! physical nature and laws do not reign here; they reign in the objective world, but not here, for this is the subjective world, in no sense physical or existent, nor perceptible to senses belonging to matter. Yet it is real, for Spirit is real, and subjective states, no less than objective ones, are born of the Spirit of the Father. This is another of the Mansions in His House. It is farther from the earth than the farthest star of the sky, because in no wise of material nature. Things of earth to the inhabitants of this world are but dreams, and vice versa. To either, the other seems unreal. This we are in is the 'Far away home of-the soul.'"

his description of the "Father" further supports my previous supposition, and says that all sujective states are born from the "Spirit of the Father". it looks to me like "Spirit" is a person's source or inner being. inner beings have inner beings, in the objective sense of things, but if we look at it subjectively -- or, frequentially, then we see that all spirits resonate with the source of the "Father". "christ" expresses this by saying we're all children of the "Father" and "mol lang" says we're "born of the Father".

to put it into my concepts, the "Father" is the upper desire (1) and conceptual (5) planes working together to create the physical (7) body. the physical entity works out its karma through incarnations into the physical and works on it's return back to the "Father" -- that is, the return to "perfection" where one perceives from the spirit looking down, rather than from the physical looking up.

the Spirit appears to be something similar to the "law of attraction" or the "law of compensation". these are the simple logic/laws that the universe operates on. compensation is like addition/subtraction, while attraction is like division/multiplication.

in a spatial sense, the spirit would like the present state of a "source" and so therefore would represent the finite set of paths possible from its present state back to its source. all sources have a source (or, all inner beings have an inner being).

in a subjective or frquential sense, all everythting resonates with its original frequency and are simply derivatives of it. because such a diversity of frequencies extend out of the original (the one), the original frequency is a much much higher frequency, being able to resonate with such a wide diversity.

each time we deviate from our resonance with the one original source, we cause an expansion of the one (all that is) because it resonates with us too.

in objective sense, the Father is in us, and we are in the Father. we all extend out (or are extensions) of the same source (father). therefore, we're all born of the same "father" because every "father" has a "father".

---

what looks to be happening, is that negative-evolution is happening all the time inside of each of us individually on the micro-scale. however, it also appears to be happening all the time on the macro-scale as well... it's quite possible that this pattern extends all the way to the source of all that is. it's definitely possible it's happening all the way up to the galaxy as well...

---

for this solar system and planet, I would guess that the "Father" is the original conceptual program and source (1,5) whereby wanted is created. fallen-angels are conceptual programs too, but they've fallen down to the physical plane and control that, creating the hostile environment for the creation to find a way to return back to its source or, "return back to the Father". each return causes a huge explosion of wanted for those going/returning and a cataclysm for those wanting to stay.

each creation evolved in this way (negative-evolution), has to find its way back to the "Father" or back to its source... that is, "find your alignment with your inner being" -- and you know how well your alignment is by how good you feel.

each divinding of the path everyone chooses which way they want to go (see: negative-evolution)

[1]: with the exception of the "I am in the [brotherhood] and the [brotherhood] is in me" -- like how can the brotherhood be in him? (no homo)

### heaven - thoughts on devachan

the way he describes the density of devachan (low) and earth (high), summons the image of evaporation and condensation reactions. like, in devachan, you're in a low density environment, so when you get bored, you come to rest, that is condensate into physical incarnation again in a high density environment. death is losing dense matter and evaporating up into higher density. reincarnating is just condensation. it appears to me no different than the precipitation cycle: evaporate, condensate, then repeat.

to explain this he says, if a medium brings low density matter down into a high density environment, this is similar to a low pressure cell -- a vortex bringing the low density air from higher in the atmosphere down, which is what causes the storm. similarly a low density ego in a high density environment can cause a psychic storm.

> The barometer on a calm day registers at sea level a definite degree of air pressure, and at one mile above the sea, on the side of a mountain, let us say, the mercury in the tube has "fallen" to another definite but less degree. This is in both cases due to air pressure. If now one desire to have the pressure existing at a mile's height, will he go up to it, or will he, bring that altitude down to himself? In storm weather the barometer "falls" also, the air is less dense, meteorological changes have taken place which in effect have brought the high aerial altitudes (ie. the conditions prevailing in high altitudes), down to the lower level. But thus has a storm been created; superior conditions have forced one. So it is that by the exercise of superior force a medium at a "spiritualistic seance" can bring back or down a soul which had gone on through the grave; but it will give rise to a psychic storm, and these are exceedingly costly occurrences.

he says that the psychic body lasts for as long as there is "sustaining magnetism" -- which corresponds with my theory that vibrating magnetic fields are felt as emotion, so he's sort of saying that as long as emotion sustains the psychic body, it can persist in the astral.

he describes devachan as being composed of all of your concepts. no two people will experience the same world because no two people have the same set of concepts:

> So also the heaven, the devachan, of one person is filled with his concepts of life, while that of his neighbor on either side--so to speak, is peopled with other peculiar mental properties. Now the state after the grave, and his or her knowledge, aspirations and trusts of life is the condition of harvest, where no one acts, but where the rewards of action in the preceding life are paid; it is the land of Lethe, where is no pain, sorrow, sickness or agony, for these earthly conditions begun on earth, and they perforce must be finished on earth. So karma decrees. Heaven is passive, not active, and results of knowledge are there assimilated by the soul; that is, made so that the new birth is like the succeeding page of a business ledger--all of the old lives, with the last added in.

he does say though most people in the world are your concept of the person rather than the actual person (soul):

> Thus passed the time around me, sometimes with real egoii of deceased earthly persons who had worked with me intimately on earth, and so had with me to reap the results of the collaboration. At other times I was alone with my concepts, which, however, seemed as real as actual persons, for all seemed absolutely real.

so, it seems that the person you experience in your world is one of tuning. if you're tuned to who they really are, you'll meet their soul, but if you're tuned to your concept of them which is different from who they really are, you'll meet your concept of them.

interesting to note that in this world, he sleeps -- so still, that means, there is some resistance which after a good rest lessens and allows that reality to be experienced. implying therefore that there are still less resistant forms of reality still (this may be coming soon).

he reiterates that the people you experience are predominantly your concept of them, and that you will perceive your "enemies" that way (the concept), not as who they really are:

> Anzimee, Menax, Gwauxln, Ernon, Lolix without the shadow, all those and thousands more who have no name to the reader were there. They did not come; no, they were with me, each as I had conceived. These were my concepts, for they were subjective, not objective; they were my ideals, not real people; and they formed my world. [...] in verity this after life is a reconstituted and inverted earth life, subjective now, instead of objective. My supposed friend may be a real enemy, yet if I die thinking him or her my friend, that concept is the one carried into the after life, and vice versa.

> In meeting Anzimee, who yet lived on earth, I met sometimes my conception of her, sometimes her own higher self. [...] she so longed from me that it developed and enabled her to project her pure soul into my plane. This was not only pleasant and beneficial to her, giving her a hold upon things unseen, of which the apostle Paul speaks, but it was a holy joy to me to meet her thus; she could come to me, but I could not go back to her. There is no retrogression.

he also says that interactions in this environment strengthened his mental capacities which could be used in future incarnations:

> From these apparent actions my capacities were developed, and tests of the worth of my conceptions made. All of this resulted in making a concrete deduction which became a part of my mental being; hence in a new incarnation I would come forth to mankind possessed of phrenological organs of increased power in the handling of political and social questions. Perhaps this power would not be actively employed, owing to other tendencies being stronger; none the less the power would be augmented and ready for use upon demand. The same thing would prove true of all these souls really associated with me, both in previous-earth-and after-heaven, the results, values and summings-up of our contemporary devachan would give them new mental traits, or increase the force of their old ones, and reincarnation would reassociate us again on earth.

so, it appears that the realisations that one makes in this conceptual world stay with a person and actually affect the physiology of a person (including the DNA?), allowing them greater proclivity to tune into these concepts (perceicved as capacities) on the physical plane.

to illustrate this, he gives an example of "zerah colburn" -- someone I had to look up, but as a child had an incredible capacity to calculate incredible things with his mind. it appears though that his father tried to exploit him as a kid, and as he grew older, his capacity (or rather his ability to tune to it) faded, and the increasing resistance of losing his capacity must have manifest itself in the contraction of tuburculosis and an early death of 34yo.

to add to that, I would say that something of the opposite is true for me. I have noticed that as I've gotten older and decreased resistance, I have noticed a far greater capacity to tune into this conceptual world. I call them conceptual programs, and I don't at all doubt that one can create and manipulate a wide variety of programs, ranging from from calculators and statistics to dream-like experiences which the person can acquire knowledge in an instant that otherwise would require years of physical experience ("I know kung-fu") -- or instant access to knowledge not yet learned (astral/akashic records?).

he also explains (very verbosely) that one assimilates these concepts into their own identity (I AM) of the person and they become a part of them, the concept incarnate:

> [...] just as my concepts disappeared when I had assimilated their value. They disappeared, because all the deeds of previous earth life had crystallized as traits of character, and they were ready for earth life again.

he ends the book with coded words:

> I was ready for activity once more. I slept, and in this sleeping died out of that life of passivity into the waking of earth, a babe in a cradle. Born to see my Master in this life, and enter the Great Rest with him!

and finally a prophesy of the future:

> NOTE: --But one will come after me who shall tell thee more of the Great Deep of Life than I. Await her words. --Author

I wonder who *she* is... probably a foreshadowing...
