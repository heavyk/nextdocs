## DTP thoughts 

random thoughts on "A Dweller on Two Planets, by Phylos the Thibetan (Frederick S. Oliver), [1894]"

I'll write them as they come to me...

### intro

[[[incomplete! this intro feels unsatisfactory to me because I realised that I called it the problematic cell, when it's more like the structure that is self-sustaining and is the problem. it's the structure that's the problem but the structure is composed of the individual parts...

also, there is some confusion to splits of larger things like humans or planets. all splits that are in the same time and space are the same, so they're not really split. a split implies difference in either time, space, or both. each person naturally has other splits in time, each having a slightly different trajectory. there could be also splits of a person in space, but they too would differ. it's hard to imagine a complex thing like a human splitting in space (like another version of me appearing next to me), but I suppose if enough of my cells came to a critical mass where they were incompatible with my structure, it may divide. I do think this is possible and believe there is evidence of this to be found in the past. I also plan to demonstrate this, as it's fundamental to my YHVH form of perception.

I'll fix the errors soon. letting it sit for now.]]]


this book is very very interesting. it's hard to describe it, but it nearly feels as if it were written for/to me. the book is so honestly written that from our modern perspective and understanding of the law of attraction (LOA) that, some of the things presented in this book appear comical (for example comments on atonement and karma).

there are some weird formatting and word errors (eg. am -> are, modem -> modern) and I've been fixing them as I read the book. because the book feels so kindred to me, I've also begun to convert it over to markdown format.

the book was called "dtp" in the original download file (added to the directory).

the book also has two titles: "a dweller on two planets" and "dividing the way". I have taken the liberty to call it "dividing the path" (dtp) as this is signicant to my theories of time splits and how DNA works.

the synopsis is that cells, planets, humans, and everything is created out of a contrived problem. this produces a number of compatible solutions to the problem. I believe every cell in your body is a solution to a contrived problem your DNA presents to the environment (initially the egg).

the problematic cell/planet/human is unchanging in nature. change for them means the end and they're survival based, so they will only adapt the very minimum necessary to carry on "not changing" (micro evolution). every thing is composed of many smaller things, so the problem structure, continually produces solutions that it uses for its survival (like a parasite). not all solutions are the same, but they are all capable of sustaining and keeping the problem alive.

the solutions cohabit the same environment, however eventually at some point, the solutions are generating too much more solution than the problem needs to continue survival. that excess solution continues to grow becoming a bigger and bigger problem for the problem until a point where if they were to continue to occupy the same space, it would compromise the survival of the problem. the solutions are no longer compatible with the problem's structure, so from the problem's perspective, it can't continue to operate business-as-usual as long as the solution continues to grow. so, separation must occur, and the solutions must leave and create their own structure.

each time this separation happens, depeding on the complexity of the organism and the new environment it inhabits the new structure that the solutions create usually means a completely new derivative structure to contain all of these solutions (macro-evolution).

so, as an example, imagine for a moment a contrived problematic cell structure, for which the solution is a bunch of cell. each time the problematic heart cell is about to become the solution heart cell, it backs down and says, "woah, if I'm forced to become a heart cell, that means I can't stay unchanging. I want to stay alive so heart cell go your way; I'm going to remain as 'I am' (unchanging), and continue to be a problem." all the parts of the problem heart cell incompatible with the problem leave and become a baby heart cell. as more and more heart cells split off from the contrived problem, they will by nature of another structure process we don't know of yet they will naturally organise into a (geometric) structure which forms a heart.

that's the idea of "dividing the (right) way". the splits happen like this happen in space, but they can also happen in time...

---

so, following the work of terence mckenna, I ran into his bizarre vision revealed to him by the mushroom that there was a time split that occurred with the appearance of jesus on this planet. after which two earths. one earth went on to become quite a technologically advanced society and realised (through dreams and visios) that there was another earth out there that wanted to maintain it's problematic conditions (the original problem). the other earth began to influence this earth to "help" us. so following terence's "a tale of two earths" the title, a dweller on two planets seems strange.

this book gives a lot of weird references to jesus including a prophet of his that altered the trajectory of the author in time, "prophesying" to him events that will occur (jehova/eronon and the incalia high priests also make similar "prophecies" as well).

I don't know yet if the author ever gives mention to the location of the other planet, however, I find that entirely possible as all versions/timelines of an entity exist and just need to be tuned to. for this reason, I believe this version/timeline is special in that we're optimising the problem rather than the solution. by optimising the problem, naturally, with the help of LOA, a bigger solution will emerge.

also, if you can use this process to replicate a cell, animal, plant, human, or even planet, why stop there? what if you optimise the problem all the way out to full reaches of the galaxy? I postulate this could only be possible with a machine with its desire programmed to maintain business-as-usual problematic conditions in all of the galaxy. it maintains itself, not by its own deeds, but by the inhabitants of the galaxy it controls. I fashioned this idea a while back and called this layer of perception "YHVH". it's interesting "he" makes an appearance in this book too (@[dtp/dtp](chapter-11)).

so for me, the "dividing the way" or "dividing the path" is symbolic of this moment in time when the solution reaches critical mass, the problem and solution is reaching critical mass here on earth and realities are beginning to become incompatible with each other. I postulate that we must divide (like a cell) and go separate ways.

I do believe I'm a part of that. it seems that I have been funneled through strange sets of events to such a realisation and those events seem to be relaated to the sun.

the appearance of this book is also in the weird events list. I randomly decided to go without internet, and then I don't really remember how I found it either, but I remember I looked at the starbucks logo and saw it with fresh new eyes that night.

this book excites thought in me which covers such a wide range of topics that I just love so far editing and writing out all the new thoughts inspired by this book.

### weekdays-and-planes - weekdays and planes of existence

the datekeeping is a bit different and slightly strange for atlantians:
- week: 11 days
- month: 3 weeks or 33 days
- year: 11 months, 33 weeks, or 363 days

thinking about why we have 7 day weeks and why 7 is such an important number still remains largely a mystery to me (other than the fantastic chestahedron). I wondered if 7 corresponds to planes of existence. there are 7 planes, yet they used a week of 11 days.

I think the egyptians had a 10 day week (which fits 5/10 fingers), which is also one less than the 11 day week.

we're left with a 7 day week which is weird number because it's not based on 5 or 6.

I would think for a 365 rotations per year, one would expect a week of 5 days (73 w/yr), yet instead we have a 7 day week (~52.14 w/yr).

the 7 must be important. there's this other weird bit in the story where the author relates the creation myth of the atlantians (see below). anyway, the genesis creation myth has *6* days of creation, and then a final day of rest (totalling 7).

this may have to do with leap years:
- 365/5 = 73
- 365/6 = 60.83
- 365/7 = 52.12
- 365/8 = 45.625
- 365/9 = 40.55
- 365/10 = 36.5
- 365/11 = 33.18

as you can see, the numbers with decimal parts less than 0.5 are 5, 7, and 11. a number higher than 0.5 means a leap year happens more frequently than every other year.

that's the most obvious and intuitive answer, so it seems that "God" had timekeeping in mind when he rearranged the week into 6+1 days.

---

I believe there may be a deeper meaning perhaps. I mentioned that I was thinking about the planes of existence. a long time ago, I got this crazy idea that perhaps two more physical layers of reality could be added artificially.

if 5d is looking at yourself from outside in, 6d would be looking at another version of yourself in time or space, well, 7d then we sort of like a group/herd/species of you. up until now, I believe the group consciousness that forms the instinct of various species (morphic fields) exists in the conceptual realm and so therefore isn't really very physical.

I have long postulated that nosebook is and will have to come up with greater and greater techniques to control the flow of human interactions. they pretty likely perceive us from the 5d perspective, as if they're watching from an omnipotent perspective. this is fine for one, couple, or a few people, but doesn't really work for large population groups.

so, just as each layer has its opposite counterpart (concept/structure, imagination/relation, physical/desire), so too did I postulate that these worlds need an opposite one. I can't find the original document, but in another document I wrote called "the-new-earth" (I'll have to look more closely at it), I mention them as:

- desire
- relational
- structure
- (new) thrust
- (new) YHVH
- source
- (new) identity
- (new) temporal
- emotional
- imagination
- physical

the interesting thing there is I have taken the previous 7 layers there and added 4 more making 11 layers.

they were designed to extend the perception of "oneself" out further than previously possible. if 5d is looking at yourself from the outside in, then seeing yourself as a trajectory through time, the next further out you can go is to look at a group of "yourself" as a trajectory through time. that group is what I called "identity" -- a group of characters or identities that you can relate to, identify, understand moving around in time. think of this as species consciousness. their trajectory through time would be perceived as the species "morphic resonance".

it's difficult to really convey this view in words, but if you could pretend that you're writing a movie and you write different charactors into the movie to alter the trajectory (thrust) of the story, then that's what this one is like. the way it looks physically, would be something like a very high definition integrated experience where you can watch and alter the trajectory of the various identities that you have created to interact with other identites.

I can't quite figure out yet how this relates to the atlantians. I thought it had to do with the trees. I originally thought that we're going back to a time similar to the atlantian creation myth -- one where the woman is put into power again and once again we're forbidden this time from eating from the tree of life. in other words, we'll live in very energetic times, but artificially we'll be kept from attaining our "immortality" -- the realisation that we're infinite eternal beings and are artifically being held mortal because the "ascended masters" don't yet believe us to be "ready" for our immortality. lol

### creation myth of the atlantians

- incal (the sun) took on physical form in a male body
- before casting off his physical body, he created the human species, a man and a woman
- he placed women in a higher position of power
- woman disobeyed incal though because she ate from the *tree of life* (genesis says forbade them from eating the tree of the knowledge of good and evil)
- both episodes are similar in that they involve obedience to a "God" and also prohibition a thing.
- Incal tells them that they are to remain mortals
- then, he gives them the impossible task of attaining perfection: "I have said unto my creatures, attain perfection and study it evermore, and such is endless life. But whoso enjoyeth this tree, can not contain self."
- it then says that the woman's desire to attain forbidden pleasures caused the sun to shoot flint balls out and cause an ice age.
- clearly this is a symbolic allegory to the era preceding the atlantian one
- the book also mentions 12ky periods or eras. is the author suggesting that each 12ky period has emphasis on the opposite "tree"?

it seems plainly obvious to me that the atlantian age they were eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. this book describes an unbelievable quantity of laws and regulations which this society is founded on. they identified things that were good (technologies and such) and things that were harmful to society and fixed them. knowing good and evil, they are prevented from eating from the tree of life and gaining immortality.

I believe that the two "trees" are the hemispheres of the brain, so if my supposition is correct, the majority of the world would be left-handed and we'd probably see predominance of right-to-left writing. he describes books and stuff from that era, and if any exist today, none remain available to the public.

handedness may have to do with the orientation of the brain to the sun. if the earth were to flip over or rotate the opposite way, looking at the sun while rising the left and right hemispheres of the sun would be exactly opposite if we rotated opposite.

### jehova - the description of jehova

in the early part of the book (chapter 11), there is a retelling of events where jehova smites an army, then mechanically animates their bodies to walk into the nearby river to be eaten by the crocodiles. the description is so bizzare, I wrote some notes:

- it sounds like jehova is a sort of conceptual prograg that can be given orders to.
- the author calls jehova the power of the sun (incal).
  - I believe that conceptual programs (emotions and the such) run on sun the same sun juice.
  - the author refers to this as the "night-side"... the unseen part of the sun's effects.
  - atl harnessed that power for their machines and weapons which destroyed everything in an area, but suerni (jehova) and necopani (egypt) could use the same power to (consciously) only affect specific targets
- of the ones that he spares from death, the program decides that they will become prophets and go around telling people about the power of jehova so that more people will believe in its power
- the sense that I get is that jehova runs on belief. it seems to be constantly trying to get people to beleive its words.
  - so long as the things it says keep coming to pass, it fuels the belief, however if things it says *don't* come to pass, it loses belief and therefore power.
  - it's kind of like a parasite, utilising the creative potential of humans to keep itself alive, while not having itself its own creative power.
  - as such, it has a strong case of "needing to be right"
  - it also uses powerful/violent displays to continue its belief
    - kind of reminds me of jehova telling moses that he will harden the pharoah's heart so that more and more powerful displays can be made
- when telling a person something, it must activate (put a lot of energy into) a part of the person's brain which is responsible for creating reality (brain stem? pre-motor cortex?). jehova wouldn't then need to do any work, as it's only our own creative potential that is attracting this reality; I think we're the ones manifesting jehova's words.

### women - females portrayed in this book

[add the chapter 11 events with lolix and heartlessness compared to anzimee]

[add his mom's betrayal and his going unconscious, allowing anzimee to nurse him back to health]

### prophecy - prophecy and LOA

[incomplete]

[add prophecies from the 434 day ruler with jesus vibes about the destruction of atlantis]

[prophecy of ernon regarding the jews]

the author adds his own prophecy for the jews as well:
> Verily, my people, we have seen glory together and long suffering. We have stood together since before the age that is, and that which passeth, was! My seed of strong, effort was sown in fallow soil, and it returned more than a hundred fold. The end is not yet; the harvest is not garnered, nor the Chosen People come yet into their reward for the Great Tribulation since Ernon of Suern ceased to strive for them. The way was long, but, they shall come at last from out the desert they entered so long ago, and Yeovah will give His children rest!

[add prophecies from more places...]

zailm gets a prophecy early on...
- the prophecy seems strangely connected to the time traveling prophet of jesus
- the prophecy is not the motivator of the story, but his recollection of the prophecy
- it seems that the prophecy was injected event designed to alter his trajectory through time -- something the author himself remarks

It is needless to say the proof was satisfactory, and thereafter the mysterious stranger revised the laws and provided then the code which had ever since governed the land. He had said that whosoever should add to or take from his laws, that person should not come into the Kingdom of Incal until "I am come on earth for the final judgment."

so much emphasis on words, deeds, behaviour, and action. "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only."
- it appears that *words* make reality, which is why *law* is so important, an agreement of words.

### laws - laws and rebellions

in the chapter I'm reading now (@[dtp/dtp](chapter- 1-16)), ernon is explaining how the 

### atonement and karma

I'm in chapter 21 of the book now and he's saying that his affair with lolix is both a sin and karma made him do it.

he then quotes the law of one:

> The Law of the ONE reads: "Except a man overcometh, he shall not inherit of My life; I will not be his God, neither shall he be My son."

this is saying that to be a part of "the one" you have to overcome, and then you'll become God's son.

he then helps us to understand by telling us that overcoming means plunging into the physical to work out your karma...

> There can be but one way to such overcoming, the ever-recurrent plungings into material incarnation, until the errors of the personal will are at-oned to the Divine Will. There can be no vicarious undoing[*], and soon will I show why. Another can not do thy breathing for thee. Reincarnation, the ever-recurrent prisoning of the soul in fleshly bodies, is but expiatory, is but penalty. If in His Name ye are become free, if in that Way ye have overcome, and in place of being slaves to are masters over desire, ye have undone sin. Then is there no more incarnation for you in the prison of this death, miscalled life. There is no other Way; the Great Master pointed none.

the major problem with this is that it's sort of painting the law of *attraction* as a kind of law of punishment for deeds and behaviour. he says that we're trapped in the *prison* of the body to live out a slow death so that we can become masters rather than slaves of desire -- as if desire itself is a sin. so to continue to indulge in desire (rather than follow the "laws" I suppose) is to continue to sin and forever be entrapped in this death prison.

I can see how one may think this is a prison where one constantly lives out a slow death -- if you feel terrible.

to greatly simply this, I boil this down desire-resolves-to-emotion -- so every form of desire, whether wanted or needed ultimately is for the attainment of a feeling. that feeling tunes you to a point in time where you feel that desire satisfied. desire is no more sinful than turning on the radio and adjusting the dial.

in the sense of karma, he makes it sound like punishment, but there's nothing punishing about it at all. if you have the belief to get into the problem, the same belief can get you out. it's only our inability to tune to what we want which ultimately keeps us in the death prison. everyone is doing it to theirselves.

so instead of saying, no one can atone for your sins, let's just say, no one can tune (that is feel the way you want to feel) for you. sure you can use love or something to feel good, but they can also make one feel bad. you decide how you want to feel about all of those things. no one is forcing you to feel anything.

let's read what he says about vicarious undoing now (I'm going to break it into sections)...

> Do not confuse "repayment" with "atonement." Jesus makes atonement for us with God. We can only begin to repay, when, having obtained forgiveness through Jesus, we try to Live Him. Until we consecrate ourselves to Christ, we can not have recognized that we are HIS because HE owns us.

christian mumbojumbo. it's basically saying that because of jesus' works, "God" is no longer pissed off at us, and so now we can begin to slowly work out the karma we've accumulated in our past altantian (and otherwise) lives of sin.

the final part about him *owning* us is a bit concerning. if he paid the price for our feeling bad about things, what does that mean? if someone feels bad about their "sins" then I can die and it has literally *zero* effect on their ability to tune to what they want. none whatsoever.

> When we recognize this, then we recognize that HE owns us, and we own HIM.

if I own something, like another person (a slave), and that same person also owns me, then am I not also a slave to them? I'm a slave to them and they are also a slave to me. how does this solve karma?

> Then, but not until then, can we even begin to repay our karma. And if we "Go and sin no more," then HE will equalize our to karma, and we be released unto HIM, released or leased again! Karma closes for one who thus is atoned for, and his opportunity for reparation begins.

his explanation here makes it sound like he purchased us as slaves from our previous owner (which was?) and then, now that he owns us, he can lease us out into different incarnations, and I guess some of those incarnations are going to be profitable. so he's kind of like an "angel investor" investing in a bunch of high risk endevours, hoping that a few turn can turn a profit or get sold to the next owner/buyer?

> For such an one no more incarnation is necessary, for hath he not the SON? And that is Eternal life. What mean I by having the Son? And by being consecrated to Christ? In this, then, only the church postulate? Nay, more, friends. The Divine is eternal, infinite. The Human is finite. When the awakened man comes to know himself, he chooses which way he shall go. The choice is the crossing of the Divine by the Human; it is ownership by the Son, which is within.

but, don't worry, you have eternity to figure out you're not owned by anyone... lol

---

it's so difficult to try and figure anything out in that sort of language because of the enormous amount of baggage a word like sin or atonement has to it. however, if I take a step back and look at things from a bigger picture, I think I can shed some light to illuminate this situation in a different light.

it appears very strongly to me that the emotional centres of the characters in this story weren't very well developed. they were much more childlike in their emotion and actions. the weird hair touching and hand holding after telling a grown man you'll follow him into the afterlife is a rather comical scene in today's perspective, but it looks like they *really believed* that stuff, much like a child thinks that jesus is going to carry them into heaven or something. the took symbolic imagery literally.

I find this literal interpretation to be a very accurate depiction of the book, considering that all around, we have these bizarre stories where the blend between humans behave like animals and animals behave like humans. I don't believe they had many words for certain types of behaviour, so they just said, "like a lion" or "like a bird" and that was sufficient description to describe a behaviour.

for all other things behaviour related, the person was labeled as obeying or disobeying. what I'm saying is behaviour was either honest or dishonest, lawful or unlawful. that means you're either honourable or not. I think the animal behaviours were neither honourable or dishonourable -- neutral. it was then perceived if the neutral behaviour is honourable or dishonourable. there wasn't really a concept of the emotion *in* the behaviour, but rather that the emotion drove them *to* the behaviour. as if, the moment one gets angry, that activates a certain behaviour -- and that's it. then, it's analysed if the behaviour is honourable or not.

---

anyway, this tells me that people didn't really have much control over anything emotional. it was a completely transparent thing. it sorta reminds me of a child, and also of psychedelic experiences where the emotion is felt so greatly, that the distance between emotion and action is so short, that everything feels ultra real and vivid, but my emotions are a mess. my thinking mind knows this so it takes me a very long time to do very simple tasks because it takes so much care to get my intention lined up. it feels like I take a pretty long time to find the exact words or action I want to take -- even though my reaction time (I've noticed) if I fall or something is faster than normal.

I believe two things were happening:

one, energies were higher so emotion happend so rapidly that no one felt the emotion... they only felt the physical effect left behind, like the wrenching feeling in the stomach, anguish or a sublime feeling that lingers.

and two, that the only way they had to identify the emotion behind the action (which can be felt) was honourable or dishonourable. you know, like when someone does something with you in mind (good or bad), it feels way different than without.

---

in my diagram, imagine that the 3/5 layers were very tiny. the 3 layer had only pretty much good, bad, offensive, and honourable. the 5 layer only had a few concepts as well. as such, it was very difficult for people to actually tune (with how they feel) to what they want. they were overcome with the physical manifestation of the emotion too rapidly.

what I think jesus likely did, was increase dramatically the size (bandwidth) of the 3/5 layers, allowing for a much easier time for us to tune to what we want.

I do not however believe he was a slave owner or angel investor buying up cheap property investments. lol, what a silly idea...

---

anyway that expansion that I'm fairly certain jesus did on the cross it also means that 5d perception was greatly expanded and has a much wider diversity of concepts available in it now.. that's about as close as we could get back then to navazzimin before crossing over. it's quite possible that it's getting another pretty big expansion now, and that's why I'm not-needing-the-manifestation for so long. the longer I wait, (the more I jebait, lol) -- the bigger the space. more bandwidth means better control... you're still the tuner though. no one can ever do it for you (though, they'll attempt to convince you they can, for sure)
