power structures and stuff

con-artist's paradise and magnetic brain treatments

pp 51

Thus we behold modern employers often doing of free will what the ancient Poseid did because of law, namely, sharing profits with their employees.

The Superintendent is equal to all the underlings. Hence, employers, when not themselves managers of the business, shall pay to managers a salary equal to the combined wages of the subordinates.

Poseid, like other countries then and since, had its social castes, as the governmental, the literati and ecclesiastics, the artisans, a limited military, which served it as a police and sanitary corps, and so on through the usual familiar list.

... the turban of the Sovereign was of pure carmine-hued silk; of the councilors, a wine red, and of lesser officials, a pale pink. The turbans of the soldiery were deep orange for the ranks, and lemon chrome for the officers. Pure white marked the priesthood, and gray the scientific, the literary and artistic classes. Blue distinguished the artisans, mechanics and laborers, while, green denoted all who, for any reason, either immaturity or educational lack, did not enjoy the right of suffrage.

In course of time beings of the genus homo were evolved, one man and one woman, and then Incal had placed woman spiritually highest and above man, a position which she had lost through an attempt to enjoy a fruit which grew on the Tree of Life in the Garden of Heaven. But in doing this she had, according to the legend, disobeyed Incal, who had said that His highest, most progressed children should not enjoy this fruit, for whosoever did should surely die, because no mortal being could have immortal life and also reproduce its kind. The legend read: "I have said unto my creatures, attain perfection and study it evermore, and such is endless life. But whoso enjoyeth this tree, can not contain self."

Incal, the Father of Life, was not supposed to punish His children except that He made the laws of nature self-executive, His immanent, will, and if any one transgressed these the guilt was inexorably punished by nature, it being impossible to set in motion a cause without a consequent effect; if the cause was good, so also was the consequence.

honourable and pompous language for interacting

worthiness bjs

My opinion of myself rose in degree when I felt that I was held in such high favor

We, as Poseidi, knew that the mysterious nations across the waters were possessed of abilities which virtually dwarfed our attainments, such as our power to traverse the aerial or marine depths, our swift cars, our sub-surface sea ships. No, they did not boast such conveniences, but they had no need of them to carry on the course of their lives and, therefore, as we supposed, no desire for such apparatus. Perhaps our scorn was more affected than real. for in our more sober thought we acknowledged, with no small admiration, their supremacy.

> What though we could speak with, and see, and hear., and be seen by those with whom we wished to communicate, and this at any distance and without, wires, but over the magnetic currents of the globe? Truly, we never knew the pangs of separation from our friends; we could attend to the demands of commerce, and transport our armies in war times with a dispatch which could pass around the world in a day; all this as long is our mechanical and electrical contrivances were at hand. But what availed all this splendid ability? Shut one of the most learned Xioqui in a dungeon, and all his knowledge would be as naught; he could not, deprived in such a way of implements or agencies, hope to see, to hear or to escape without external aid. His marvelous capabilities were, dependent upon the creation of his intellect. Not so with Suern or with Necropan. How to hinder one of these people, no Poseida knew. Shut in a dungeon, he would arise and go forth like Saul of Tarsus; he could see to any distance, and this without a naim; hear equally without a naim; go through the midst of foes, and be seen by none of them. What, then, availed our attainments if opposed to those of Suernis and Necropan? Of what use our instruments of war even against such a people, a single man of whom, looking with eyes wherein glittered the terrible light of a will power exerted to hurl in retribution the unseen forces of the Night-Side, could cause our foemen to wither as green leaves before the hot breath of fire? Were missiles of value here? Of use, when the person at whom they were aimed could arrest them in their lightning path, and make them fall as thistle-down at his feet? What, even, was the value of explosives, more awful than nitroglycerin, dropped from vailx poised miles above in the blue vault of heaven? None whatever; for the enemy, with prescient gaze and perfect control of Night-Side forces we knew not of, could arrest the falling destroyer, and instead of suffering harm could annihilate that high ship and its living load. A burned child fears the fire, and in times past we bad sought to conquer these nations, and failed disastrously. Repulse was all they sought to effect, and successful over us in this, we had been left to go in peace. As the years stretched into centuries, our ways likewise became those of defense only, never offensive any more

> "If, Astika," said she, "it be a pleasure to thee that I do this that thou askest, it is also one to me. It is also much of a pleasure to me to repeat it to the youth thou favorest. I would, however, that the maid, thy daughter, were not here," she added, sotto voce, with a glance of antagonism toward Anzimee, who sat near us, engaged in perusing a book, apparently, but, as I fancied, not in reality. This jealous undertone was not heard by Menax, though Anzimee heard it, and presently arose and left the apartment in consequence. This action I regretted, and the cause of it I resented, as the Saldu quickly saw, and because of it bit her lip with vexation.

> It hath been ever thus; the seed sown in the Acre whereof the corners are marked by posts of which the first hath but one side, the second five sides, the third six sides, but the fourth again only five, hath ever been scorned by man. That seed groweth a tree seventeen-branched. So was Suern. In another day it would be watered by Poseid; later it must be in Poseid. Yet again this would be after it was pruned by its Sower. Then it must grow till the day's end, and become great in the next day. But greatest at the end of that day. I have spoken a riddle that whoso unfoldeth it proveth him of the Tree I have spoken, and filled with deathlessness. Hear, O Israel! Seek, O Manasseh, and Ephraim, seek! Land of the Starry Flag, open thine eyes, and thou, too, O Mother land!


### chapter-ll - the description of jehova

see @[dtp/thoughts](jehova)

princess lolix and the 140 other women come from a nation called saldi. she is called "saldu" (female saldi) in many cases too. in spanish and other latin languages, the word "sal" means salt that is, like the "salt of the earth" or salt in the alchemical process. weird how the saldu is like the electrolyte (salt) between the positive and negative terminals in this story.

I haven't finished the book yet, but it seems this is a very important point the author is wanting to make. there are three major players in this book:

- atlantis (incal's technology)
- suern/jehova (incal's belief and word power)
- necropan/osiris (incal's ???? dunno yet)

then, there is a pivot of a woman. again this is a four character story of 3 boys and a girl that reminds me of "hunchback of notre dame".

there is a weird part in the middle of this chapter as well, where prince menax is shocked that women are allowed to woo the men in saldi culture -- very remenicent of the description of the gypsy by frollo see @[newblog](2022-01-23 00:04) and @[newblog](2022-01-23 15:27). the females here are probably are going to be like esmerelda, symbolic of the primitive spirit, lustful and inspirational of desire in the atl hero, zailm numinos (quasimodo).

the chapter ends with a comparison to the saldu princesss (lolix) and the american maiden:

> The princess said these last words ("... Power, my god, work so swift destruction!") musingly, apparently lost to her surroundings as she sat with clenched hands, admiration depicted on her beautiful face and her glorious blue eyes with their far-away look, but oh! so heartless, so cruel, after all. Queenly in figure, commanding in personality, beautiful, wonderfully beautiful, the world now, as then, would call the Princess Lolix; indeed she bore a most startling likeness to thine own fair American women. But these are not like her, really. She, lioness-like, sided ever with the triumph-power. But the real American maiden, sympathetic, true as steel, graceful as a bird, sweet as a rose just blown--like Lolix in these three last traits, but ceasing to parallel her further, for she of to-day clings to her father, her brother, her lover, come sunshine, come storm, success or adversity--faithful unto death. Such have their reward.

- lolix:
  - power hungry (wants to triumph)
  - heartless (to tragedy and loss of life)
- the american maiden:
  - sympathetic (to tragedy and difficulty)
- both:
  - true as steel
  - graceful as a bird
  - sweet as a rose just bloomed (blown)
- women up to the present (not sure to-day atlantis or to-day 1890's):
  - clings to her father, brother (men in the family), and lover, come:
    - sunshine:
      - "we can feel good and enjoy good conditions together"
    - storm:
      - "we can also survive bad conditions together"
    - success:
      - "I love you when things feel to be going well"
    - adversity:
      - "I also love you when things don't feel so good"
      - "no matter how cranky and obnoxious you get,I'm going to stick with you"
  - such have their reward...
    - I think this is a comment on women clinging to deadbeats and not going after what they want like lolix and her desire to be with powerful jehova wielding men.
    - it could also be foreshadowing

the chapter concludes with her renouncing her country for its powerlessness, and saying that because she can't be with the jehova wielding king, she would settle for staying in poseid.

menax rebukes her for being so willing to forsake her country and gods so easily. 

the author then reflects on how she could be so feminine (all the stuff listed above minus lolix section), but hasn't yet fully realised that she too is sympathetic (when she blooms). he also links her feminity to her desire to solicit an emotional reactions (opposite of sympathy), but instead (because of her heartlessness) received the opposite: a rebuke.

### chapter-12 - menax' weird masculine affection and importance of family

menax reveals how important family is to him, even desiring to see someone who resembles his son (zailm) and the ridiculous amount of emotion emitted. this seems setting up for a part in the future where family values are important.

the next is a comparison between the two main women (anzimee and lolix)

> Two girls--Lolix of Sald, and Anzimee of Poseid! A wide continent separated their two countries, but a yet greater distance was between the daughters of the two lands. Lolix, with no sympathy for those in pain, no sorrow for those in mortal agony; Anzimee, at the very antipodes of such traits of character.

after menax presents anzimee her new brother, their hands touch and he feels unworthiness to receive her love, even though (being reminded of his prophesied future sin) no sin has stained his record *yet*. he believes the prophecy, and that he wwill soon sin.

finally a weird pro-america, pro-jesus bit to finish off the chapter:

> America, thou art beloved by me even as was Poseid. Foremost amongst nations, art thou so because of woman--and Christ. Thou wilt keep in the van because of them, and eclipse all the world beside when the happy karmic day shall have arrived which places woman not below, not above, but by the side of man on the rock of esoteric Christian education, the granite of knowledge and faith, which withstands the winds and storms of ignorance. Built on such foundation, the National house shall not fall; built on other, great shall be the fall of it. Here is wisdom: myriad serpents are in a man; in thee; keep them. Now ye are slaves. Be ye masters instead. But, alas! this Way is narrow; few will to find it.

### chapter-13 - soul language?

one thing that strikes me is how much hand-holding and dependence on others. yet at the same time, in other places on the planet life seems rather trivial with the amount of people willing to engage in warfare. the atlantians seem to have chilled out and are no longer aggressive because of the mystical powers of suern/jehova and necropan/osiris.

this ultra codependent nature on other people manifests itself in weird interactions between people. after the hair touching and hand holding, menax (his new father) asks if zailm will stay in the palace for the night. he responds,

> "My father, I fain would stay; but is it not duteous that I go unto my mother this night and set her at ease? She hath an infirmity of nervousness that can not well withstand my absence at night."

wait, so he can't leave his mom alone for one night because she gets nervous? presumably only he believes that only he can put her to ease.

menax goes, "ok, we'll bring her to live here then."

he leaves and notices the star sirius and makes express mention that it's flashing red (meaning that we're traveling away from it, rather than toward it like today, shining blue).

he talks about how, "Phyris, Phyrisooa Pertos!" which is: "Star, O star of my life." sounds very similar to the same saying of people on his *home planet*...

since he's a dweller of two planets, is he suggesting that his normal home planet isn't earth but in orbit of one of the sirius stars? it's a weird comment. he calls it the language of the soul (that is the immortal part of the body)

the other really strange thing is the author interjects a tidbit saying that he will pause transmitting in the astral and turn to his *alter ego*, "phyris". I'm not sure if this is saying that the astral version perceives two separate incarnations of himself one as phyris (sirius) or what...

anyway, it seems phyris is a foreshadow to a future thing -- probably something to do with women given the close of the close of the previous chapter (where he desires them to be equals).

then another weird thing happened as I just finished up that part and was pondering the astral sirius guy claiming his alter ego to be a star, thinking about how I too believe that my alter ego is also a star. right then, the song on the headphones says, "from star to star" -- and the sense that I got is hard to describe, but maybe the author and myself are more similar than different... we're really different though. some of the stuff he writes about christ, atonement and karma are so super cringe I can't stand it. I'm really having to hold back a lot ridicule to some of the author's VERY OUTDATED IDEAS.

### chapter-14 - adoption and high priests

they go to the main temple, a giant pyramid twice the size of the great pyramid that reminds me of the "pyramid of the sun" in central america. in there, there is this giant triangular platform that has an "unfed fire" coming out of a crystal.

it was installed by a peculiar type that had similar powers to ernon/jehova. when asked who he was, he said:

> "I am from Incal. Lo, I am a child of the Sun and am come to reform the religion and life of this people. Behold Incal is the Father and I am the Son, and He is in Me and I am in Him."

this is some pretty serious christ symbolism here. the important thing to note though is that he claim to be the son of the father *sun*. personally, I regard the sun to more feminine than masculine, so I wonder how the sun got its masculine identity. it either started with this guy or was there previous. the creation myth says that the women messed up trying to get the forbidden fruit and so that may have been the end of the female sun then and became masculine since. not sure...

after making such a claim he proved it by healing people and then for his final trick he drew a square 5.5 feet either way (so, 11^2 feet?) and out of it appeared a great white perfect cube of quartz, blew on the rock and since fire has been coming out of it. (note the cube, blowing and fire symbols)

this was a big enough miracle for people to allow him to reform the laws and code of atlantis. of course just to top things off, after reforming the laws, he says:

> He had said that whosoever should add to or take from his laws, that person should not come into the Kingdom of Incal until "I am come on earth for the final judgment."

it's funny that custodial activity seems to be present even in the channeled retelling of events that happened 12000 years ago...

for maximum effect and maximum obedience, he sculpted the laws into the side of the quartz crystal of unfed fire with his finger with laser precision.

he then prophesies the destruction of atlantis:

> "Hearken unto me. This is my law. Behold it also written on the Maxin-Stone. No man shall remove it, lest he die. Yet after centuries have flown, behold! the Book shall disappear in sight of a multitude, and no man shall know its place. Then shall the Unfed Light go out, and no man be able to rekindle it. And when these things have come to pass, lo! the day is not far off when the land shall no more be. It shall perish because of its iniquity, and the waters of Atl shall roll above it! I have spoken."

bear in mind, that it's pretty possible that all of the laws that this guy setup and wrote in that stone either had an influence on or were the laws that became the laws mentioned in the early chapters. I wonder why the author is going out of his way to show the progression in laws?

---

the last part is foreshadowing of that the high priest, a "son of the solitude" will betray another "son of the solitude". considering this betrayal foreshadowing being placed in the same chapter as the apocalyptic prophecies and the telling that their return to ruler positions, I sense a coming custodial intervention. when searching for "son of solitude", it appears that jehova wielding ernon is also a "son of the solitude"

### chapter-15 - his mom deserts him

so, despite his idea that he is the only one able to put his mom's nervousness to ease, instead of going to live in the palace with the nobility she explains that having heard of his fortune, she is now released from the shackles of caring for him and decides to marry an old lover, prior to his father which she never loved because it was an arranged marriage. she's moving in with her new second husband.

hearing that his mother does not care for him nearly as much as he thougtht she did, he goes unconscious and has brain fever for 2 weeks (22 days) just from hearing that his mom didn't care for him as much as he thought she did. all his hard work in the university was for her and for anzimee, who fortunately now his sister.

menax, is frightened at how close he came to death and his mom peaces out considering menax' nurses as or more capable than she. he tries again to see her later, but she's not happy to see him. this apparently is a painful subject for zailm. she's supposed to care, right? not be heartless.

anzimee isn't heartless though. studying hard to be a physician, she wants to help people. he finds out she nursed him back to health while he was unconscious.

he's going on a the trip to suernis and anzimee will join them. they're circumnavigating the globe, visiting tropical, semi-tropical, temperate and frigid areas.

lolix is jealous of anzimee getting zailm's attention, though she continues to pretend to be unaffected by it.

### chapter-16 - voyage to suern

he mentions that the sahara wasn't fully desert yet. it still had some green parts and tropical trees. though previously a seabed, it used to be much greener than it now is for them. a similar disaster happened in north africa that happened to atlantis which sucked all the water out of the environment and broke (rent) the rocks "through and through" (probably the process that made all of the quartz sand). he mentions that this happened also in "southwest incalia" -- so like arizona, southern utah and the grand canyon area.

king ernon explained that he didn't send the chaldean women for purposes of lust. he sent them so they can be taught a lesson. he goes on this whole thing about how nature doesn't account for your knowledge of the law before returning the punishment, saying nature won't spare a baby falling off a cliff for lack of knowledge of the danger as an example.

the suerni people never seemed to smile (not because of contemplation), but their default state, seemingly to be constantly filled with anger/wrath.

despite their countenance of perpetual anger, they seem to possess mysterious capability to manifest the food they desire to eat out of nothing with some mysterious force. all types of good food, but not meat.

what was a magnificent display of power that no atlantian would ever see, was normal everyday stuff for the suerni.

suerni people did not love their ruler ernon as the atlantian people did king gwauxln.

suerni people have always been ruled by the sons of solitude, which have tried to initiate the entire population into the understanding of night-side of nature. most didn't care so much for it and the few that did, devoted theirselves to it and desiring to leave the presence of the less-energetic people, became full-blown sons of solitude.

to try and get his people to be masters rather than creatures of circumstace for the utilisation of this night-side of nature, ernon made laws and exacted them with punishment -- to which the people disliked him. most would rather be unclean sinners than pure vessels for the work of the night-side of nature.

it seems that the suerni are the first ones beginning to show signs of major fatigue concerning the enforcement of laws. seems that rebellion against power structures and their laws is coming soon, probably starting in suern and then going global.

### destruction of atlantis

> Umaur, where in eight centuries more they must find a refuge who should be so fortunately fated as to escape from Poseid, until, "Queen of the World" no more, she sank beneath the waves of the, Atlantic. Eight centuries, whose lapse would see the proud Atlantean become so corrupt that his soul no more reflected the wisdom of the Night-Side because, the calmness of morality being fled, the key to nature's Penetralia would have been lost, and with it his dominion over the air and the depths of the sea.

### karma and atonement

> Will is the only Way to Christ.

the weird "God doesn't exist" bit from mainin

### weird mol lang quotes

> no great reform, nor anything greatly good, can succeed in any century, decade or year nominated by the number nine. Hence, human hopes will wax on wane, will seem to go forth to victory, but will meet only failure until the new century.

but, I thought it was 1800's. is he saying that in the following centry (900's), it won't work until the following century (1000's)? weird.

> I have so willed, my son, that the features of this visit to devachan shall be withdrawn from thee, and thou wilt remember them only as a vague, delightful dream [...] I have but to disassociate the astral body here formed by thine experiences, and thou wilt thereafter know this state only when that astral shall control thee as its medium.

interesting, he's saying that just by perceiving/having the experience, that is what generates the psychic body. so the concepts experienced and the physical sensation, etc are what generate the psychic/astral body.

this severing of the psychic body -- though, it's still there just not at a frequency that can be accessed from a "normal" state of consciousness -- may be precisely what is happening in those "missing time" experiences. there must be a way to ensure that the "memory" or the psychic body formed is detuned or retuned so that the experience can either be forgotten or "remember them only as a vague, delightful dream".

#### his 7-parts of the body

- the I AM, or ego
- the body of the spirit, or spirit-body
- the human soul
- the animal soul
- the astral reflection of the two lowest principles:
- vital force
- earthly body thereby animated.

very weird... there's a lot of stuff missing here. like .. he's missing all of the non-physical counterparts... where's source?

what I think he's done is he's divided up the 3 lower layers into 7. so, above this would be source (where everything is equal). the very top of the conceptual realm, just extending out of source is the ego, followed by the spirit-body or, concept of yourself

then, he has two souls, the human soul and the animal soul. I'm not sure what he means exactly by soul though...

---

however, it seems to make more sense if we remap his 7 onto my 5. the ego is the identity/YHVH. the spirit body is probably also in that definition too -- the concept you have of yourself. the human/animal soul is the temporal/thrust layer. the astral reflection is the imagination/relational[^1].

the vital force I'd put somewhere between the imagination and the physical layers... I don't know why he makes it a body though because it doesn't make sense to have it as a body. I think what he's saying is that when you are sad, your energy (vital force) body is diminished, which is a reflection of how your emotion (eg. how you conceptualise yourself). I'll go with the imagination/relational[^1] there because your vitality is a living image of the way you feel. tough to say...

finally, the animated body is obviously physical/desire.

I really don't know why he splits it up this way...

[1]: I call it relational because it's how concepts interact/relate to one another, but it could just as well be called their reflection or harmony to each other. each concept reflects back only the parts that resonate -- good or bad. 

### the closing year

the closing year by george d. prentice

    'Tis midnight's holy hour, and silence now
    Is brooding like a gentle spirit o'er
    The still and pulseless world. Hark! on the winds
    The bell's deep tones are swelling,—'tis the knell
    Of the departed year.
    No funeral train

    Is sweeping past; yet on the stream and wood,
    With melancholy light, the moonbeams rest
    Like a pale, spotless shroud; the air is stirred,
    As by a mourner's sigh; and on yon cloud
    That floats so still and placidly through heaven,
    The spirits of the seasons seem to stand—
    Young Spring, bright Summer, Autumn's solemn form,
    And Winter with his aged locks—and breathe,
    In mournful cadences that come abroad
    Like the far wind-harp's wild and touching wail,
    A melancholy dirge o'er the dead year,
    Gone from the earth forever.

    'Tis a time
    For memory and for tears. Within the deep,
    Still chambers of the heart a specter dim,
    Whose tones are like the wizard voice of Time,
    Heard from the tomb of ages, points its cold
    And solemn finger to the beautiful
    And holy visions that have passed away,
    And left no shadow of their loveliness
    On the dead waste of life. That specter lifts
    The coffin lid of Hope, and Joy, and Love,
    And, bending mournfully above the pale,
    Sweet forms that slumber there, scatters dead flowers
    O'er what has passed to nothingness.

    The year
    Has gone, and with it many a glorious throng
    Of happy dreams. Its mark is on each brow,
    Its shadow in each heart. In its swift course
    It waved its scepter o'er the beautiful,—
    And they are not. It laid its pallid hand
    Upon the strong man,—and the haughty form
    Is fallen, and the flashing eye is dim.
    It trod the hall of revelry, where thronged
    The bright and joyous, and the tearful wail
    Of stricken ones is heard, where erst the song
    And reckless shout resounded. It passed o'er
    The battle plain, where sword, and spear, and shield
    Flashed in the light of midday—and the strength
    Of serried hosts is shivered, and the grass,
    Green from the soil of carnage, waves above
    The crushed and mouldering skeleton. It came
    And faded like a wreath of mist at eve;
    Yet, ere it melted in the viewless air,
    It heralded its millions to their home
    In the dim land of dreams.

    Remorseless Time!
    Fierce spirit of the glass and scythe!—what power
    Can stay him in his silent course, or melt
    His iron heart to pity? On, still on
    He presses, and forever. The proud bird,
    The condor of the Andes, that can soar
    Through heaven's unfathomable depths, or brave
    The fury of the northern hurricane,
    And bathe his plumage in the thunder's home,
    Furls his broad wings at nightfall and sinks down
    To rest upon his mountain crag—but Time
    Knows not the weight of sleep or weariness,
    And night's deep darkness has no chain to bind
    His rushing pinions. Revolutions sweep
    O'er earth, like troubled visions o'er the breast
    Of dreaming sorrow,—cities rise and sink
    Like bubbles on the water,—fiery isles
    Spring blazing from the ocean, and go back
    To their mysterious caverns,—mountains rear
    To heaven their bald and blackened cliffs, and bow
    Their tall heads to the plain,—new empires rise,
    Gathering the strength of hoary centuries,
    And rush down like the Alpine avalanche,
    Startling the nations,—and the very stars,
    Yon bright and burning blazonry of God,
    Glitter a while in their eternal depths,
    And, like the Pleiad, loveliest of their train,
    Shoot from their glorious spheres, and pass away
    To darkle in the trackless void,—yet Time,
    Time, the tomb-builder, holds his fierce career,
    Dark, stern, all-pitiless, and pauses not
    Amid the mighty wrecks that strew his path
    To sit and muse, like other conquerors,
    Upon the fearful ruin he has wrought.


### became a law unto himself

> Even Mol Lang, before he passed and triumphed at the Crisis, to which I was soon to come, and [...] in passing that ordeal he passed from finite life to everlasting, and became a law unto himself.

### the temptation

> I was offered all this free, thereby violating the divine law, which never allows something for nothing.

wat??? since when did the universe acquire an economic policy?

> But I gathered my Δ armor about me, lest this Being, who seemed so fair and good, were not so, and if not good, its touch might be fatal

fear?

> Then I said: "[...] Demon, thou offerest that which subordinates all other beings in these realms to my will. This realm is governed by pleasure, passion, appetite, lust, all selfish; and no penalty set upon wild license. These carnalities would conquer me, too, if I accepted--me, who am otherwise about to become immortal, more than Man, karmaless. [...]"

my will? so he's now a christ? when he says "more than Man", that must be what he means -- a christ. then, when he says, "karmaless" -- does that mean his actions no longer adhere to the "law of compensation"? is he saying, now he will will become a law unto himself (like mol lang in the section above)

### anzimee's encounter with mainin to save zailm
