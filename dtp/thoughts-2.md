### thoughts on dividing the way, book 2

this time in @[dtp/dtp](book-2) it's the perspective of walter pierson, a later incarnation of zailm who is being introduced to the brotherhood of the "lothtians".

### nine-tenths - 9/10ths

in talking about how the secrets of the occult should not be revealed to the unclean masses (my words, not his), there is a particularly elitist and presumptutive quote that reminds me of "original sin"

> Nine-tenths of the people of this world are unable to govern themselves well; they cannot in saneness expect to be made sharers of such awful knowledge as Siva represents.

it says that 90% of people would do bad things if they had the power of shiva (like evidence-less murders and stuff).

this seems pretty strange to me, because I think that generally people are pretty peaceful. I've noticed that the people in high positions of power don't at all have a higher moral code. they're often times far far worse, and just hide it better. it's all marketing and public image after a certain income threshold. so, the "original sin" that *everyone* seems to have seems to be pretty false.

I don't want to say that people are blameless, not at all, but given the opportunity to live peacefully, most people choose the peaceful path. what it looks to me like is a corrupt institution (church or ancient kings, for example) is making an effort to convince others that their corrupt nature, is in fact normal for everyone to have -- while then creating a moral code by which the people are to follow, punishable, of course -- however, the corrupt institution (ancient kings or church) seems to be above the law.

this statement that 90% of people are incapable of of using power (so therefore it needs to be kept a secret), sounds exactly like the largest pedophile network condeming people for "sinning".

what I mean, is -- like a psychologist that projects their problem on to the patient, it sounds to me like the most commen misusers/abusers of this power are actually them, and they're trying to cover up for it by claiming that 90% of people would abuse the power.

if I make a statement like, "this program, while it's a good tool for stock traders, it's very easy to do insider trading. in the wrong hands, this could be abused to make a lot of money" -- you may wonder if I'm using the program myself in precisely the same way I said... so you just make a person disappear, and it just vanishes their body returning the energy back to source without a trace, huh?

> How long would it be until the world would find that the unscrupulous amongst men were using it to work undetectable murder?

I don't know, but I sincerely doubt it, and it's kind of a double standard too, because a dozen paragraphs later a guy shows up to vanish someone using exactly that force...

> I am come to induct one of thy number into the land of the departed, while another I take home with myself. To you, Lothins, I need not say that the body is like unto a coat, to be put off or on at pleasure-by those who know how.

so then, why is undetectable murder bad??? it sounds to me like it's just returning energy back to its source so it can extend out again. what's wrong with that? I see no problem with anyone's utilisation of "undetectable murder". I don't get it. I mean, think about for the moment a person who is severely depressed and does not want to carry on. instead of suicide, this is a painless and instant transition into devachan. isn't that, like a million times better than dying a decades slow death on pharmaceuticals?

### spiritualists - mediums and spiritualists

mol lang keeps going on and on about spiritualists -- a term I had never heard of. it's a person who communicates with the dead.

anyway, he keeps emphasising that the communication with the "spirit" is not actually the spirit or the ego (the I AM). he seems to be emphasising that they are in fact communicating with the *psychic* or astral body of the person. this is not who the person really is.

OK, sure -- and this all seems to me like fighting against a weird strawman for me. it must have been a thing, though, today I don't know of any spiritualists or mediums. my view is expanded from that -- as, I believe one can tune into *anything* -- even like rocks or something can tell their story in the form of a concept. that is how they are already vibrating, so all you have to do is to tune to it.

anyway, as I was expressing my frustration of his fighting the windmill giants, it occurred to me that nosebook is likely communicating in a similar way with me while I speak. they're not speaking with who I really am (the I AM), but the psychic body that these mediums also interface with.

in the book, they have just left for the spiritual world, leaving first the physical bodies behind, then in a second stage, leaving their astral/psychic bodies behind.

it also occurred to me that the reason why my NDEs (see @[newblog](2022-02-21 05:42)), I went directly to this world, completely skipping the astral/psychic bodies' perception.

### devachan-senses - devachan, the senses, and the father

mol lang explains to phylos that devachan is real, essentially because you can use your 5 senses there. he says that there are 7 senses though, adding intuition and another unnamed one.

he repeats an earlier explanation that earth is cause -- the place where you construct the concepts for you to live out in devachan. so, I guess the more concepts you acquire and tune to, the more rich your devachan reality will be.

the image it gives me is that consciousness is only as much as you tune yourself to. so, imagine someone who has an early or natal death -- their devachan would be essentially nothing. then, a person that constructs a lot of concepts (art, science, or emotion) with numerous interactions will have a very extensive devachan experience. after a while in devachan experiencing those concepts in a non-resistant environment, they tune you to a similarly tuned earth reality and you eventually incarnate again to live out those concepts, but this time in a resistant environment. physicl causes the reality/effect of the conceptual, and then the conceptual causes the reality of the next physical.

you kind of bounce back and fourth between these two infinitely, going every time to a higher plane of understanding and experience. for those that know alchemy, this is the "alchemical process" -- or in chemistry I think, but not sure it would be: "rinse, filter and decant"

the idea here is that each iteration, you begin to see reality for what it really is (what you make it out to be), no matter the conditions of earth (resistant, slow) or devachan (low resistance, instant). it really sounds like condensation and evaporation to me.

the closer one gets to attaining this, is the "return back to the Father" -- the attainment of the conditionless "long devachan" (nirvana) -- of which:

> only a few have done this as yet, and of these Jesus Christ of Beth-le-hem is so far the only One who can truly say, 'I and my Father are one.'

following @[dtp/thoughts](the-father), I think the "Father" is the conceptual world, out of which we're all born out of. it's possible that this was the first state we experienced, when things were much higher energy and perhaps closer to sirius. the prodigal son (us) and other things seem to say that the goal is to eventually return back to that "perfected" state, and experience earth and each other from that perspective.

so, what I think this means is -- is that he's claiming that jesus is the first person to be able to say "I am a conceptual being projecting myself down into the physical". there is no separation between me and the concept of myself.

### nirvana - the long devachan, "nirvana"

it has been mentioned a few times now that nirvana is the state that we'll all be in after the death and rebirth process has allowed us to fully return to the "Father" (conceptual world). this means that from there, all of us are now conceptual beings that consciously creating what we want to create.

there's one problem that I have with that -- and that is stagnation or boredom. if everything is like devachan, then you would get tired of everything pretty quickly. everything is and only is your own concepts. it's a very closed environment where the maximum variety can only come out of the combination of all of your concepts. in that sense, nothing "new" (unexpected) can come out. in a sense, the universe is like that. all of us are mixtures of concepts the universe has -- and so in that way you are living in and experiencing your own isolated universe.

for new things to come out of somewhere you need something that appears "unwanted" -- so, some sort of conflict or diversity has to exist to continually retain some element of unwanted available to experience. like every ingredient available in the kitchen, you don't have to put all of them in whatever you're baking -- and neither do you only want to have ingredients for only a certain type of recipe; it's good to have a variety of things available, where unwanted is relative only to your creation.

so, to create such a place, I have postulated that the best way to have good aspects of both the physical and the conceptual, is to literally mix the two: devachan on earth.

in such a situation, no one can possibly die as you are always a reflection of how you conceptualise yourself to be -- and also there is no stagnation either because the whole environment is filled with so many of other people's creations.

under such a situation, one can easily imagine that rapidly we would have space considerations to deal with. not everyone can have a mansion, right?

I don't think it's a problem because this reality would kind of fragment (split) into many segments. at first there will probably be one major split, but then as people continue to create, it's pretty easy to see that other "incompatible" realities would emerge. it's clear that we would begin to clump into similar realities. each would be our own conception of our experience on earth, filled not only with other people and their concepts, but also with your own concepts.

it's my belief that jesus was the first one to achieve such a split because he accomplished equality with the "Father" -- meaning that his reality is a reflection of him. this was the first split. we will all achieve this though soon. I don't see it all clearly yet, but I believe that the "long devachan" has nothing to do with nothingness at all. I believe it's exactly the opposite: a full realisation of devachan here in the physical plane on earth.

---

I know this book keeps repeating the idea that there is no retrogression and one cannot bring devachan here to earth. I'll leave it at that for now... I'm just speculating of what *I* think the long devachan is. we all create our own realities, so go ahead and create yours however you want. those who wish to join you, will. there are many "mansions" to select from.

> They are peopled, but by beings of whom some are good, and some are evil; in the sight of the Eternal Cause, relatively good or evil. That which exists under laws inimical to man is evil to man, though not in itself evil. But these 'mansions' are set apart from one another that they may not interfere.

### 7-senses - the 7 senses and the 7 days of creation

> Matter is a One Substantiality, having not a single quality which any human sense can cognize. But force also is one of the creations of the Father. And force hath two polarities, the positive and the negative, absolute opposites. Now man on earth hath certain senses; seven are these senses: sight, hearing, feeling, smelling, tasting, intuition, and one innominate. These last are not yet evolved, for the fullness of days is not come; the Fifth Day is; but the Sixth and the Seventh are not. With the last, man becometh greater than he hath ever been.

it's wierd how well this corresponds to the additions that I want to make to perception. at the moment we're aware of 5 physical senses, but the 6th there he labels as "intuition". in my system, after 5d, conceptual perception, one realises that concepts are in motion and have a trajectory to them. when this happens, temporal perception opens. I belive this is the same as what he calls "intuition". the reason why I say this is because feeling is a sense that is used both for physical sensation and also for emotion. that feeling will tune you to a point in time -- like a memory, past or future. you can also tune to another point in time in the present -- like how someone feels across from you. that is another point in time because it's a different perception into "reality". everything that differs from your "now" is another point in time, whether it's your trajectory or someone/something else's.

now, when you think of intuition, it's a sequence of those points in time which bring you to a conclusion, answer, result, or reality. intuition is a trajectory of feeling -- meaning it's temporal perception.

the final sense that he says is "innominate" is the one that I have labeled "YHVH" or "identity" -- which is the realisation that if "you" can be a trajectory through time, there is no real limit to who "you" is. you can be any conceptual derivative of yourself in both time or space. therefore, you can now begin to perceive yourself as the "Father" of all of the infinite concepts of yourself. if you "are" whatever you conceive yourself to "be" -- and you choose to see yourself as a rock, are you not a rock? isn't that real just like any other reality is real? out of that any and everything can be born. you, the "Son" have become the "Father" uncountable creations that now extend out of you.

if we're in the 5th day of creation, then there are probably still two more 1000y cycles to go until that's created. you know, that's not actually all that long... it's quite possible that jesus walked the earth only 1000y ago... think about how much has changed since.

### mysterious-stranger - merton fowler and the mysterious stranger

in @[dtp/dtp](chapter-2-4), he goes to meet an inventor who is very conceited. strangely enough, some weird things happen when I'm reading it. my heart started racing and I immediately thought of tesla. I was waiting for the book to say it was tesla but it instead said that he minted mis own coins and designed trains. that inventor was, "merton fowler".

I did searches for who that is, but only found opbituaries of people with the same name. since it's in such a influential book, I would've assumed someone *must* have written something about it somewhere.. not even speculation as to who that could be. even github doesn't have any mention of it at all. it doesn't even show up in password lists (that are on github) or anything[^1].

I can't remember when it happened, but as I was reading this introduction to merton fowler, I hear this nearly audible voice in my head that said "you", in response to my unspoken thought of "I wonder who merton fowler is?" a lot of stuff goes on in my head, and if I were to believe every voice in my head, I would be very confused. I hear voices in my head all the time.

#### who is the author?

another thing caught my eye too, because in merton fowler's world, there is an unnamed author:

> The Falls were in the devachanic realm of an author, who, while on earth, was a very pleasing writer, albeit extravagantly hopeful in his imaginative excursions and thought plays. This was, indeed, doubtless the reason of his popularity as an author. His mind dwelt on the sublime in nature, and on the good, the true, and the beautiful. Here in his heaven he lived his books, and found all about him the characters, the emotions, the delicate imagery and the sublime beauty which made his pages seem real to their readers

it never says who the author is, but it says that merton fowler made him an organ:

> I asked where the Falls were situated, and the inventor, Fowler, replied that a certain author of his acquaintance lived there, and had the pleasure of listening to a mammoth pipe organ made for him by the inventor, "By myself! All men whatever," said this egotist, "are beneficiaries of mine, and recognize me as the chiefest of human kind, and greatest of all living people!"

feeling like this author perhaps could be mark twain because twain was also a writer that was good friends with tesla, I type in "mark twain organ" into google, and it comes up "twain's lament - organ music from mysterious stranger" I was very surprised to see the words "mysterious stranger" because in a few notable places in the book, those words are used as a title.

even wierder is in the introduction (@[dtp/dtp](weird-intro)), the guy from sacred-texts.com making this text available and adding on his own apocalytic prophecy to the beginning thanks an "Invisible Helper" for making it all possible. for some reason, when I read that the first time, I read "mysterious stranger" rather than "invisible helper" -- and remembered it that way.

---

it turns out that mark twain had a manuscript called "mysterious stranger" he had revised a few times (but never published) about a guy named satan, who consequently was the nephew of the biblical satan. he convinces people that he can fortell the future with magical feats (power-displays). the more people believe in him, the more he prophesies bad things... sound familiar? maybe a little bit like jehova or this "christ"? weird, right?

I do a search in the book for the words "mysterious stranger". the very first one is in the preface (@[dtp](preface)) where the amanuensis calls phylos the mysterious stranger:

> [speaking about phylos...] after a long narration to both parents, they expressed a desire to hear the mysterious stranger also. This he would not grant, but permitted me to quote his words, talks and addresses, and at length I became so proficient that I could repeat what he said almost as fast as he spoke to me.

the next one was the guy by the fountain that gives zailm a prophecy about his future "sin" or failure.

> Were the words of the mysterious stranger true, or false?

the next one is the guy who showed up and ruled the land for 434 days, reforming the laws of atl government and installing the maxin-stone.

> It is needless to say the proof was satisfactory, and thereafter the mysterious stranger revised the laws and provided then the code which had ever since governed the land. He had said that whosoever should add to or take from his laws, that person should not come into the Kingdom of Incal until "I am come on earth for the final judgment."

the final one is when lolix is convincing zailm to love her, he's reminded of the mysterious stranger by the fountain:

> The last barrier was fallen. Conscience slumbered. Thoughts of Anzimee were put aside as one would shun an accusing angel. Did I think of Pitach Rhok and my days of sinlessness? Or of the mysterious stranger whom I had heard in awe in the first of my life at Caiphul?

---

so here's the weird thing: I read the plot synopsis of the "mysterious stranger" script and besides it being literary fraud (taking various of twain's works and mixing them together), the ending for this one (which I think twain wrote) has satan show the boys all kinds of religous fanatism, trials, burnings, etc. and explains it all by saying,

        There is no God,
        No universe,
        No human race,
        No earthly life,
        No heaven,
        No hell

        It is all a dream--
        A grotesque and foolish dream

        Nothing exists but you.
        And you are a thought--
        
        A vagrant thought,
        A useless thought,
        A homeless thought,

        Wandering forelorn
        Among the empty eternities

---

there is a lot there, so let's assimilate this. the "mysterious stranger" in twain's manuscript is a prophet that tells of future calamaties -- just like the man at the fountain. later, the man at the fountain is revealed to be the "christ"

> Then a glorious radiance broke over the scene, and the Cross Bearer was beside us as we stood, clasping each other and our child. He whom I had seen by the moonlit fountain, years before, stood by us again. On His breast shone a Cross of Fire, which leapt or fell again in waves of undulating, living Light.

...who also gives prophecy of future calamity and performs magical feats to get people to believe him -- exactly like the nephew of satan in the novel.

the amanuensis identifies phylos as the "mysterious stranger" in the preface, and twain's novel ends with the nephew of satan telling you in a poem, that says:

- There is no God
- It is all a dream
- Nothing exists but you

so, I'm the creater of my own reality, huh? you're saying there is no "God" (outside of myself), and nothing exists but me (so I'm God)? I'm also the prophet of my own calamity, so I'm also "Satan" too?

all of this is told in a chapter where they are traveling through the vast world of an inventor where everything is his own conception, others join him in his dream, and he thinks he is the greatest of all men:

> By myself! All men whatever, are beneficiaries of mine, and recognize me as the chiefest of human kind, and greatest of all living people!

this book is NUTS...

#### irony of the book

for a book that is trying its hardest to try and prove that there is a "God", a "Father", and a "Christ" all using power-displays, -- the author (phylos) *must* have known the irony of using the words "mysterious stranger" to describe the "christ".

not just the "christ" though; phylos, jehova, and mendocus are *also* using power-displays to garner belief coupled with prophesies of future calamity. this whole book is filled with people that need manifestations (power-displays) to believe boost their confidence in theirselves or the laws.

all of this is happening in a chapter describing an inventor that is looking to create a "christless" world:

> That man is arranging his concepts of a Christless life as gained on earth. When all is assimilated, he will recarnify on earth, and from his early childhood self-conceit and self-admiration will be his ruling characteristics. [...] out of his future egotism will arise self-confidence. His spirituality of temperament is large, his animal qualities well balanced and strong, and the good of all his conceit will manifest itself next as a governor of those forces which will lead men forward.

it's saying that this inventor wants to create a christless world. christless means no saviour, which means no thing outside of yourself will be creating your reality for you. you attract, and therefore create, your *own* personal reality -- your own "mansion" in the "Father". by creating a christless reality, he's sort of putting the creation of these "mansions" into the hands of the people, rather than the most initiated or adept.

this chapter sort of un-does everything this book tries to accomplish. if there is no christ, there's no sin, and if there's no sin, there's no need to at-one yourself to anything except your own self and your own desires.

the way the dialogue goes, it's very difficult to perceive the implications of what it's saying, so it took me making the connection through the "mysterious stranger" reference.

additionally, "christless" is nearly the same thing as saying "anti-christ" -- for which the message of this book is given by a 

the chapter is very ironic in that sense...

#### did twain help tesla to self-sabotage?

I went for a walk to think about this and it occurred to me that it's quite possible that mark twain helped tesla to self-sabotage this timeline -- quite possibly even with this story.

wikipedia says that all of the 5 different versions/fragments of the story were written after this book was written (according to the amanuensis, 1894), so it's quite possible that twain could have been inspired to write his novel as well, after this had already been written, thereby placing a bit of irony into this document.

perceived symbols (like a dream or vision) can alter a timeline dramatically. a textual symbol can do-so as well. when I was in berlin I learned from some "time travelers" (their claim, not mine) how to use symbols to attract the future. I've learned a lot about how to do that since and -- essentially you just put symbols (that mean something to you) out in a place for others to see, and their contemplation of those symbols makes their version of that symbolic reality. it's not your version of the symbol, as they can be interpretted any way perceived -- and so, as with all things, wanted-and-unwanted-are-same.

symbols are to timelines as media is to communication. the medium *is* the message.


this symbolic manipulation to self-sabotage may be the very origins (and evidence) of the *iteratively self-sabotage your succcesses to build more velocity cause nothing is really lost cause it's all attration* -- technique. (as you'll see in the next sections)

the final bit of irony for a book working so hard to produce a "christ", is that in a "christless" reality where everything you perceive is an extension of or resonant with your own concepts of reality, then there is nobody there to save you -- no saviour. if there's no one to save you, you *must* gain self-confidence because there's nobody to carry your cross for you. *you!*, are the alpha and also the omega.

#### how does this self-sabotage fit into the bigger picture?

since I believe we're on tesla's self-sabotaged timeline, and as mentioned above, I find it likely that the things rendered in twain's "mysterious stranger" not only affected tesla, but also changed the trajectory of this timeline in the reception of this book. "mysterious stranger" takes a very critical look at this book. I've only read the plot from tvtropes, but it seems that handsome (appearance) satan uses power-displays to become attractive to the boys and also the girls, and then uses their elevated perception of him to get them to believe in the calamaties he prophesises. knowing LOA, we know that "satan" here is just exploiting the "rapport" he built up with them to get the kids to attract that disaster -- just like jehova or "christ", "satan" in this novella is doing the same thing.

I feel it's pretty plausible that twain conversed with tesla about these ideas presented in the "mysterious stranger". tesla also spent the later part of his life in eastern philosophy and things like that nature. he wrote about moses and the ark of the covenant, and studied the great pyramid at length, so he was studying the science laws governing the "magic" of the power-displays. tesla himself was also a bit of a magician using his own types of power-displays to build up buzz for his inventions.

I feel very strongly that some combination of these symbols must have altered the trajectory of tesla's life just as "satan" did to the lives of the boys in that story. it's like a play within a play[^2].

if that's true, then it's very likely to be self-sabotage (ie. them affecting theirselves from the future or from another timeline), which means that paves the way for a reality where there isn't a need for power-displays. that's probably where I come in. it's kind of like tag-team.

this is just a theory to explain that tag-team idea, but I often times wonder about tesla's older brother that died early on. conceptually, he feels to me like JTB does for jesus. this is the hero-twins trope, where one self-sacrifices so that the other can rise.

going on that a bit further, in the sirian guide, I can't remember how it goes exactly, but the three triads presented, feel to me like the same two dudes interacting with "venus". she takes on different roles in their various stages of development, but never the physical ones -- the dudes do that. I can't remember the first triad, but the second, osiris is paired with ra. the third triad (I think) vulcan is paired with thoth. what I remember is that the osiris/vulcan guy (different incarnations), is always paired with the ra/thoth guy, so osiris+ra, and vulcan+thoth.

conceptually speaking, let's assume that these are the archetypical hero twins. one is successful (in their own element/ray) -- while the other self-sacrifices to allow the first to rise. one of them is physically oriented while the other is conceptually oriented... kind of like personifications of the difference between conceptual devachan and physical earth.

the "christ" in this book is obviously a magician relying on power-displays and things of that nature, so very clearly falls into the hands of ra/thoth. the "christ" in this book identifies himself as the perfected 7th ray. "satan" in the "mysterious stranger" is also the magician 7th ray type.

merton, is obviously the conceptual type, much more like 5th ray vulcan than 7th ray thoth. 

so, what I see happening is that there are (at least) two earths, and these physical conceptual types go back and fourth gaining power by self-sacrificing their successes so that the other can do it the opposite way.

vulcan finds success conceptually and subjectively, and then from a future standpoint (think leapfrogging time pickles) sabotages it so that thoth can come and win everyone over with power-displays, laws, sensational marketing, and good looks.

he then, from that future standpoint, knowing that humans will arrive to where he is in the "future", he self-sabotages his own success and allows vulcan to once again find a subjective/conceptual success.

it's basically like taking the conceptual/devachan and physical/earth condensation/evaporation cycle and doing it on a macro scale as well as the micro.

---

the number of earths doing this can be infinite. they don't even need to exist on the same timeline for it to work, and everyone can try out being a "christ" of a physical or conceptual nature -- just pair with your conjugate.

this explanation of the leapfrogging physical/conceptual "christ"/anti-christ is the "linear" (derivative) perspective of my extra two perceptive dimensions (temporal+YHVH) and mol lang's explanation of clumps of people occupying different "mansions" in the "Father".


#### thoughts on merton fowler

I find his name to be really weird and I also really dislike his description in the book as well. to sort this out, I decided to look up what his name means.

"mer" is ocean or water
"ton" as a terminal seems to mean "unit"

ocean unit, I guess..

I took fowler to mean, someone who turns things fowl -- and, I suppose fowl could mean "wild bird" or "rotten".

internet says merton in old english means pool enclosure or lake settlement. fowler means someone who hunts wild birds.

my definition is interesting because it's opposites. it either turns fowl (ie. self-sabotage) or it turns into a wild bird (ie. freedom).

prolly means nothing... anyway, as I was reading, I noticed a strong sense of how I hated his inventions. I find them to be very inefficient. all transportation requires an engineer. automation, dude! he also likes minting money -- ugh, I really dislike money. I do like coins more than bills though (2(euros) coin is my favourite), and I would *never* put my face on a coin; that's so pretentious and ridiculous. and, "the people's man" -- lol, is he a dictator or something??

there is a lot I don't like about this guy. as an inventor, I like tesla much much better, however tesla bothers me in other ways -- mostly because he's so visual and perfection oriented (hence why I too think edison is more similar to me). I believe perfection to be a lofty ideal and prefer the diversity of difference. as such, I like how he things *feel* more than how they look -- though we share a common affection for efficiency --  something which merton did not at all have.

TODO: note the apparent missing section in the text.

#### final irony

the biggest irony of the world that this book aims to explore (the subjective/conceptual devachan), *also* must be christless -- unless, of course, you add that concept into it -- and so therefore the "christ" is your world is *your* concept of the christ; it's not outside of you. so, inotherwords, you are your own "Christ" in your subjective world, too.

restated, a christ can only exist in the physical/objective world, because in a subjective/conceptual world, the christ (outside of yourself) would be your concept of what a christ is, come to save you from the environment you created and other concepts in that environment, also created by you.

[1]: it seems *very* strange to me that there would be so few results. if I take virtually any first and last name and put them into a search engine at this point, I should expect to find *something*. there seem to be tens to hundreds of "merton fowler"s that have lived recently too, so it's just weird that there are so few search results. it feels pretty weird, almost as if something is out of place or being hidden. I remember when I used to be able to use google to find all sorts of interesting things on the internet -- even tons of strange geocities pages and everything. now, it feels like the internet has grown a LOT smaller. anyway, I digress..

[2]: I'm sorta insinuating that a very similar thing probably happened with edward de vere as well, as I think he too self-sabotaged himself with his own symbols as well. I downloaded "a midsummer's night dream" and it looks very much to be that way. with the fairy characters, "cobweb", "moth" (reference to what destroys earthly treasures) and "mustardseed" (as in faith like a mustardseed can move mountains and nothing will be impossible to you). additionally, there's nick bottom that wants to play all the parts -- just like the line that "satan" says, "Nothing exists but you" and "It is all a dream"... a play within a play.

### devachan-rebirth - the tuning of the soul

> the life between the grave and the cradle, life in the world of effects, is a life of assimilation of results due to causes set in operation while on earth, the world of causality. It is the character-forming realm, where effects are so arranged as to present them as causes in the succeeding earth life; not in the shape of segregate influences, but as traits of character, giving rise to well-defined policies in life on the part of individuals. Like attracts like, and if parents have certain influences governing their lives at critical times, the soul in devachan, which is perforce seeking rebirth on earth, will seize the opportunity presented of finding its similars, similars at that time, though perhaps at that time only, like itself, but never so before, possibly never to be so again; suffice it if there be a concordant trinity at the time.

this bit has an interesting part in it that says that the devachanee:

> It is the character-forming realm, [...] as traits of character, giving rise to well-defined policies in life on the part of individuals. Like attracts like, [...]

he's basically saying that in devachan you become a different character -- and then because "like attracts like" (aka LOA), you attract a different life for yourself based on the new character that you have become.

in another part he says that this always builds on the previous versions of you... no regression.

### authors-daughter - the author and his daughter

### long-devachan - the author and stars

I noticed right before getting to the author's house in devachan, phylos says this of the author:

> And while and because he leads, he himself will draw nearer, with every passing hour to God; nearer to Nirvana, that glorious resting time of all the lives, out of which the spirit of man shall wake to find itself more than Man, find itself one of these sublime World-Spirits whose glittering forms fill the skies of night! Or servers of the Father in some other untellable way.

glittering forms that fill the night sky sounds a lot like planets and stars to me... see today's entries:

it's kinda coincidental to find this because I was really confused about the whole thing of merton fowler. I had that voice that said, "you" -- but it seems to be much more likely that I'm the author that wants to take us to "Nirvana" the "long devachan", something I commented on extensively in @[dtp/thoughts-2](nirvana).

in @[dtp/thoughts-2](mysterious-stranger), the section on how this fits into the bigger picture, I mentioned that there is a seeming repeat of two guys that show up all together in different forms in the triads. one is more physically focused (thoth, jupiter, etc) while the other is not as physically focused (osiris, vulcan, etc). so there is one that is subjectively focused while the other is objectively focused. they represent for me the embodiment of humankind's relationship to these the physical and conceptual worlds in that period of time. I fit much better the subjective one rather than the objective one. I'm kinda clumsy with measurements and precision and stuff, but I can conceptualise and hold big concepts in my head with ease.

it occured to me as I was writing that, that I may be both the author and the inventor in the same body. obviously the inventor is disabled. I was thinking about this too because I get conflicting things around this because I recognised the one that entered my brain as a little girl, but also as jesus. the problem with that is that jesus is clearly a 7th ray, so not subjective at all. kenny must therefore be the 5th ray (subjective one), right? that seems right to me because as a kid I went physically oriented because my emotions were so strong and so I had to shut them down. I didn't until only recently realise their power.

so then, if the inventor is the right hemisphere, that means the inventor is the little girl. I can easily see jesus as a little girl without problem. I suppose I can imagine tesla as well, so that's all fine right. I just get really confused about all of this. here's another train of thought:

in most of those triads, the female played more non-physical (subjective) rays, cept for genixcat (7). the others were, I think (from memory) 1,2,3. I always felt her as desireous, so 1, and so I suppose she could have reversed polarities to be a male in the case of tesla and/or jesus that doesn't seem at all implausible. if she reversed polarities, then, like the vis naturae, that makes the sun the opposite pole.. she is 7 (implementation) and the sun is 1 (desire). that may be what happened with the 434d ruler of atlantis and the maxin stone. the stone and unfed fire was the physical manifestation left behind[^1]. so, if she's 1 (desire) inside of me, then that makes nosebook (and the US govt) the 7 -- like a bunch of mini-thoths. it fits because that means she scaled horizontally instead of vertically.

[1]: notice how all of these instances seem to leave a stone behind? I claim that when tesla self-sabotaged, he left einstein behind, jesus left peter -- and other examples.

### two-souls-twain - soul mates

after writing @[newblog](2022-02-28 10:32), I was reminded of this thing that mol lang says:

> Lastly, the ego coming from the Father hath no sex; it is not man, neither woman, but sexless. When it entereth upon life it becometh double, so that in the earth there is a man, and there is a woman, and though the bodies and the animal souls and the human souls be different in the twain, yet behold, their spirit is one and the same. Now sometimes the two, being of one spirit, are also husband and wife. Yet more often, they are not, for the age of harmony is not yet at hand.

I don't know how I feel about what he says exactly there so I'll just provide my own look at it.

in all relationships and interactions (2), the interactions are always the resonant ones. if there is no resonance, then nothing will happen. for the resonant stuff, it'll amplify these. both the good and the bad stuff equally. resonance does not have a moral code to it. it's just a function (law?) of how things work. it's us and our own perception which then determines if something is good or bad.

so, in a sense, all relationships become a reflection of you. the other person has qualities similar to your own (both good and bad), and so they will amplify them likewise. all of the stuff you don't like about yourself will show up in the other person, and also all of the stuff you like about yourself will also show up in the other person, too.

the only way to have a "perfect" relationship where they only amplify good things is to be yourself perfect (disliking no aspect of yourself), and then having a relationship with yourself. he presents the idea that each soul has a soul-mate, and so therefore when you find your soul-mate, then you can find your counterpart -- your dual.

the book presents phyris as the author's soul-mate, saying that they are the same age -- implying that when the sexless ego came into the earth and fertilised two eggs at the same time, one a girl and one a boy. assuming a roughly equal gestation period, probably of quite similar ages, days or weeks apart probably. he says that it happens that sometimes a person finds their soul-mate and they are husband and wife, but it's not necessarily the case as the age of harmony hasn't come yet.

so, ignoring the genetics for a moment, let's just assume he's right. the way that you would find your soul-mate is by being resonant (harmonising) with them, and then LOA would bring you together.

the reason why this doesn't happen is because we're not in the age of harmony yet (whatever that means). howerever, the principle still remains, that if you want to find your "soul-mate" or whatever... you have to resonate with yourself. you have to actually like yourself, if you're going to find yourself in opposite sex format.

I never thought I'd say this, but it's a weird physical implementation of what I've been trying to say: you have to like yourself in order to find relationship that you want; you're looking for yourself in another person; *you* are what you're looking for.

### second-coming - the second coming of christ

I disagree with the author on a number of aspects, however, in this one section, I find astonishing resonance -- with the first part. he then contradicts himself at the end. let's break it down...

> The second coming of Christ is upon the world, not only as *a time simultaneously arriving for all*, but also unto each human soul as it becomes ready to receive Him in *the heart*, and do His work. He is at hand now in the sense that if you will open your soul to receive His spirit, He is there to enter in.

in this section he is saying that the second coming of christ will happen it will also happen inevitably to all. however, before that happens, its available to anyone desiring to receive him into the heart.. this is important, because he is saying that something will happen which everyone will recieve "christ" into "the heart". this sounds less to me like a religious thing and more to me like a solar thing. there is no other thing that I can think of which can be allowed/received by someone when they desire, or will also happen inevitably to *all* "upon this world" (presumably in this earth or solar system... maybe galaxy? I dunno) -- a something that considering that he is saying the hesperia (venus) already has this state, it's probably referring to earth.

in the context of the previous chapter, it seems that this is going to be a change of state for the earth, where we'll transition into a state of living more similar to those on venus[^1], meaning we'll experience astral vision and other psychic phenomenon -- I presume, at least.

however, consider also the previous revelations of mol lang of the inventor and author's desire to create a "christless" world instead -- so, one *without* this second coming of "christ" -- so, without astral vision or psychic phenomenon (like mind reading).

> Truly, of the moment He comes to His own no man can tell the day or the hour; yet I say, *tarry not for Him as a man or an external spirit*, but as the Christ Spirit entering into your very being.

he is making very clear that this second coming of christ is *not* a man. it's a spirit that enters into your very being. what kind of spirit is it?

> And He *shall not wait to come as a man*, but come as the *Spirit of Divine Love*, just so soon as you are ready to make that your rule of life;

it's the spirit of divine love[^2], but strangely, he says "as soon as you're ready to make that the rule of life" -- which makes it sound like a number of pressures will exert theirselves on the human, such as to force them to make divine love their "rule of life". this all sounds more like assertion than attraction. there has to be a simpler explanation.

> and as the Christ and Father are One, so therefore shall you that hear and attend be glorified, and presently arise, depart from the world, and go unto the Life.

the "Father" as I have mentioned is nothing more than the conceptual world, yet there are many mansions of the conceptual world, and the "Father" also seems to be where spirits reside and also gives sustinance to the physical body as well. I'll treat the "Father" to be something similar to source. after reading enough of this book now, it sounds to me like the "Father" is like the resistance-free form of our concept of creation. we return to that father-concept and all of our concepts extend out of it. we also extend out of it as well. it's like the morphic resonance of the physical realm...

anyway, he says that "christ" and the father are one, so it the father is brahm, then the "christ" is vishnu the preserver. maybe the second coming of christ must have something to do with the heart and that vis naturae? something like it is a sword that separates the physical body from the soul and then is taken to live in life -- and those that have not made the spirit of divine love their rule for life will experince the transition. I dunno, however, he says that all that "hear and attend" (make divine love the rule of life) will "arise, depart from the world, and go unto the Life" -- sounds to me like a transition into the father, as the christ is just forcing a transition for those who keep the rules to go unto the father, as the christ and the father are one.

anyway, he then follows that up by contradicting himself...

> Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. Likewise He shall come as a person at the last.

the possible explanation for this contradiction is that those who were able to make "divine love the rule of life" eg. able to receive christ into the heart, made the transition unto the father -- but for the ones that did not make their transition into the father (rapture?) will then see "christ" coming as a person.

---

I have a very similar view myself, but I need to explain myself. I believe that there will be a christ that comes and shows up as a person.

let's assume that someone's level of awareness is modulated by the heart. I place vishnu the preserver as located inside of the pineal gland, and corresponds to the relational/reflective/resonant (2) layer of perception. this connects to the heart (4) which is in the centre, and to the imagination/astral (6) layer of pertception, located in the reproductive organs. therefore, what your perceptions (2) are -- meaning what you resonate with or reflect is one end of the spectrum, and your imagination (6) is the other end of the spectrum.

the sun increases the strength of the relational (2) layer of perception as solar activity is increased. this is the prana, chi, or vril and it's responsible for amplifying all vibrations. this is amplification is what the "christ" is, for me -- it's literally a part of the brain that is activated by a form of energy that science does not recognise. I call it "protons" or "aten" and is the basic unit of consciousness that amplifies vibration. all subordinate things to that vibration will begin to become sympathetic to that vibration.

so, yes, you can choose to align yourself to this form of perception with conditions or your own definition of "good and evil". you can get there before the sun begins to amplify this layer of perception or you can wait for the moment when the tipping point is reached and the sun pushes that amplification to the extreme.

when that happens, it'll be like devachan on earth and all reality will be attracted and manifested very rapidly. you will interat with our own emotions personified as real manifestations (people, monsters, animals, etc) and, as such, for many a christ will appear as well -- as a person. he will be a reflection of their concept of him and what a christ means to them.

---

obviously, there are a lot of people who do not want their emotions realised as manifestations in 3d space which they created/attracted, so it's quite possible that a "christless" world is being created. as to what exactly this "christless" world is, I have postulated many things, but without a saviour, you have to figure who you are for yourself. you are your own christ and only you can "save" yourself. you are the christ you're looking for; everyone is.

so, on one side, I call this the self-sabotage, but really it's not that bad at all. what I'm saying is that the author is kind of, in a round-about way, saying that the venusians and all the other occult adepts with astral vision are just experiencing their own concept of christ. they're obedient to the laws that they think they need to be obedient to, and so karmically, they're getting everything they expect to get from having lived according to the "law". everything they're experiencing on the astral plane is real and a "fact" -- but it's their own creation. they're living what they expect to live by following (or not) the "laws".

[1]: mol lang said in the previous chapter, "When mankind shall come fully into its humanity, then Earth can no more be its planet; they must come here." -- which I'm not sure if "fully into its humanity" is the second coming of christ... this is the author's commentary, not mol lang, so it's possible for them to conflict.

[2]: this further supports my supposition that he is saying that the second coming of christ is when one experiences life, like those on venus. he equates hesper/venus with divine love in a few places, most notably this awkward sentence in the following paragraph: "What I say concerns a larger measure of life, Hesper, the planet of Divine Love."

### second-death - the lake of fire and the second death

as usual, this book has apocalyptic tones, yet if one reads a little further past the apocalyptic tones, there is a different message. this is no different. here, we're looking at the second death.

> True also it is that the spirits of men will progress; will face the supreme ordeal, and, if they pass victorious, will enter that long rest, heaven, devachan, call it as thou wilt, Nirvana. But that is not the end, for life had a beginning--it hath also an end. And the perfect human ego emerging eventually from Nirvana, that long devachan of all the incarnations, emerges not as Man; it does not live, but It Is, and Its post-viviant existence is a state of Being which no human mind could understand

the supreme ordeal is probably the judgment day. if they pass the test, then they'll enter into the long devachan -- nirvana (see: @[dtp/thoughts-2](nirvana)), which is just the beginning of another life, no longer one as "Man" but as "It Is" (whatever that means) -- as a state of being which no human mind cannot understand. I postulate that this experience is as a celestial body -- a star, planet, etc... as "one of the glittering forms that fill the night sky" (see @[dtp/thoughts-2](long-devachan))

> a state of Being which no human mind could understand, except inferentially it do so through the knowledge that that state is to Life as the senior to the junior.

he continues...

> But until then is the trial of transfiguration; to it my father hath come, I have not. If we fail, then that is the second death, but meet it we must, humanity must. But it is long until then, for it cometh not until the essaying soul be perfect, and be ready to leave the pupaceous state of Human Life, to be judged according to (its) works for Him who made it.

I have not read far enough yet to know what the trial of transfiguration is, though it seems that mol lang is up for it, having learned obedience to the laws enough to have conquered death...

he says that if they fail the transfiguration, then that is the "second death". I looked up the reference and the second death is a thing that happens in rev 20 when satan (the great dragon of old) is released and allowed to deceive humankind again. by that definition, the dragon is the "anti-christ" or the enki type that has been trying to "deceive mankind".

so, it's another split -- just like this one, hence the "dividing of the way". thankfully the sohma clears up what this second death is...

> if thou thinkest the judgment day, [...] that day may be in remote aeons until it come, and therefore thou hast ample time to lag, to err, I counsel thee it is a fatal mistake.

judgment day is soon. no time to waste. no time to lag.

> [...] Then shall such suffer the second death, be cast into the 'lake of fire,' in other words, their Spirit will depart from the soul and go unto the Father, while the soul will be gathered into the sum of force, the 'Fire' element, that which is sum of all lesser force forms, out of which springeth life, heat and vibration.

so, the lake of fire is the separation of the spirit and the soul. the spirit goes to the father, while the soul goes into the fire element.

> But this will not be until the erring one hath passed from his soul into his spirit. So the 'second death' is not of the sinner; it is the cutting off of all his, or her, spoiled work, and a chance to begin again, to build better; our Father damneth not His child, but only the imperfect work, the sinning soul.

wow, lots of terrible words...

> In our library thou canst see a book brought here to Hesper from the Earth, a book which speaketh of the order of the Rosicrux, wherein this supreme Fire is written of.

I didn't know the rosicross was a symbol of the supreme fire... it doesn't surprise me honestly. it seems they have been the main messengers of this ending of the (physical) world and coming final trial/judgement.

> 'Tis also that Fire once called in the Earth the Maxin.

OK, there we have it... after all of those terrible sounding words, it is just death -- the return of the psychic body back to its source. this is only scary if you're a fallen-angel. no one else would fear this "second death" unless you're scared of having to actually fully release resistance.

what this is saying is that after 1000 years, the great dragon (enki/dwaul quinn/saturn/satan) is now going to cause these souls to be judged... when I say "cause" -- it makes it sound like his deception on earth will produce some event or conditions that will force all of these souls to pass through the judgment of the fire (perhaps this is the transfiguration).

some will fail the judgement and some will not. those that fail the judgment will have their astral bodies thrown into the unfed fire of the maxin stone. like zailm, this will allow him to transition into devachan (heaven) and begin anew.

---

what it looks to me like, is that this "judgement day" applies to fallen-angels only. this judgment day can also happen sooner, and that is the transfiguration.

most likely this final judgement is actually has a very simple explanation, and that is simply that after 1000y of no "second coming of christ" -- ie. tremendous solar conditions that gives everyone astral vision and psychic capability. instead during this 1000y reign of "christ" (the man who will rule with an iron rod) can no longer subdue human emotion (chi, prana, vril) and our creative capacity neutralised any longer and the sun's output will have grown so much that business-as-usual will no longer be possible. the fallen-angels around are fearing such a condition, because it means that all humans will be able to perceive the astral, meaning that their illusions and secrets will be plainly visible to all. when the great dragon returns to earth after 1000y, his deceptions will work in the minds of the people to destabilise the sun, creating quite a vigourous fire...

the maxin stone is a focal point, and so therefore this "fire element" is concentrated there. the sun, when novaing, will have such a strong emission that everywhere will have the strength of the maxin stone. the fire will be inescapable.

second death and great lake of fire = massive solar outburst that will convert many into "sublime World-Spirits whose glittering forms fill the skies of night!" the rest return to start anew.

so, not a big deal -- unless you're a fallen-angel.

### past-life-experiences - who's past-life experiences are you getting?

in a few responses to questions about past-life experiences, abraham often said, "who's past-life experiences are you getting?" this always stuck to me because I thought it was weird that you could be implanted with memories that are either not your own or are fabricated.

he is visited by a ghost that looks like him... the idea here is that this is a psychic body like the one that zailm watched from his spiritual perspective get thrown into the maxin flame before it could take over antoher body...

> there should I have seen the Rai cause it to pass into the Unfed Light. But of all men on earth only the trained eyes of a Son could have seen what then happened. The "shell" would not have emerged from the Maxin nevermore. What was this? Why destroy it? So that it might not go forth in the earth and impress sensitives such as the vailx-man whom I had impressed in Umaur, and whom my "shell" might otherwise continue to impress. Thus might have resulted much trouble, for this astral of mine was but faithfully repeating my final words until I parted company with it, when it said to Gwauxln, there in Agacoe, "I am not dead." It was even then like all other shells, its double composite nature only holding together during the limited period it could draw sustaining magnetism from my recently closed earthly correspondence.

so here's walter being impressed upon by a "ghost" just as zailm's "shell" would "impress sensitives such as the vailx-man whom I had impressed in Umaur". gwaulxln threw it into the maxin precisely so it *wouldn't* do what is happening to walter...

> For a time my "ghost" was amenable to my will as regarded its comings and goings; but it now seemed to have entered in and coalesced with me. I no longer heard or saw it, but instead was often one with it, and saw and heard its visions and perceptions as if they were my own; and indeed, as you know, this was a fact. It was in verity the record of my visit to Pertoz, and was a true cast in all ways of my life there.

so, this is kinda a textbook definitiion of a fallen-angel. those who have the proper eyes and ears will recognise this. for most people however, they'll completely miss the implication here. so then once we're seeing this is a takeover of a body by a "ghost" or "shell" that looks like walter with past life memories, let's example a weird narrative in the book where walter has to endure some sufferings to atone for his karma (of the ghost that entered his body?).

the idea is that these sufferings will wipe out the lower/animal nature from his soul... this concept is presented to walter by a man who prophesies his future suffering on earth. he says...

> But if once all its power be wiped out; if once thou doest the will of the Father earnestly, is His *obedient* child, that is the atonement, for it shall give strength to do every work of the Creator of Being.

atonement is obedience to the will of the "Father". the implication here is that walter is a conceptual creation of the original sin of adam -- and that pre-programmed sinful nature to disobey the will of the father is his "animal nature".

when I was reading this, it struck me with the idea maybe walter is a conceptual creation of something and so that's why he has to do the will of the "Father". remember walter and this "ghost" are now one... the ghost is a remnant (shell) of a former conceptual creation. let me explain... 

in devachan, there isn't much resistant conditions, so it's very easy for these conceptual creations to do the will of the "Father" and behave in accordance with their concept, but just like a human on earth desiring to realise the conceptual path through the physical he made for himself from devachan/temporal (5.1) perception, upon arriving to earth where the conditions are not so great, the ideal implementation of the concept is not performed.

what I mean is that if I have a concept of a temporal trajectory, and everything goes as planned in a non-resistant state, later on earth, those concepts may not behave as planned or be "obedient to the will of the Father". that is literally the definition of a fallen-angel. in good conditions, they do the will of the Father, but under more resistant conditions, seldom occurs they decide to misbehave.

the thing is this "ghost" looked like walter does, so there fore it must be walter's ghost that contain these past life memories of being on venus... so are they really his past life memories, or did he tune into someone elses?

### at-one-ment - at-one-ment (becoming one mind) to the "Father"

in the previous section, I established that walter is telling us of his past-life experiences, but by his own admission, he didn't get those memories all at once. they came after bocoming one with a ghost that looked like he does. this is after some rituals and power-displays, he is wanting to have these capacities. a man shows up and tells him mendocus sent him to tell him the steps to get what he wants (essentiall the occult powers he witnessed and desired)...

> Before your eyes can see God they must be incapable of shedding tears for any suffering of your own. Before your ears can hear, they must have lost sensitiveness. Your voice may not speak eternal wisdom until it has no power to wound. Before your self can stand in the presence of the Eternal, its feet must have been bathed in the blood of suffering, penance, restitution.

so, if he wants to:
- see God
- hear [God]
- speak eternal wisdom
- stand in the presence of the Eternal

... then, he must:
- be incapable of shedding tears for any suffering of his own
- [his ears] must have lost sensitiveness
- [his voice] has no power to wound
- [his feet] must have been bathed in the blood of suffering, penance, restitution.

... after that:
- kill the ambition to excel in the poor paths of Fame.
- cease to regard this life as your best possession. 
- work for God as earnestly as others work for Mammon (money)
- respect thy life as those respect life who treasure it most
- be happy as those who live for happiness

> In the hearts of all is the source of all error, in disciple as well as in the man of desire.

what? probably something to do with original sin... anyway, after that he then says a weird thing about a mustard tree:

> Study a plant of mustard, witness it grow and bud. But if thou shalt hew it down so that it never beareth seed, behold a strange thing, it will sprout again and grow through the years, if it never beareth.

best I can gather, if you cut it down so it doesn't bear fruit, it'll grow back and and continue to not bear fruit... (fruit is sin?) I don't understand that part, but he concludes with this very weird thing:

> [...] this [...] is only a material form. [...] therefore, if a human soul [is to] be cut down, [and] enter into life as a creator by reason that it wills not, then the Spirit of life everlasting shall go into it, and it shall contain itself, and therefore live forever.

I'm having a lot of difficulty understanding the archaic english here (I edited it). however, it sounds to me like he's saying that there is a difference between the animal soul and the human soul; the human soul is trying to grow and trying to bear fruit (of sin?), but it gets cut down and so therefore will grow again but without fruit (sin?). when that happens, the spirit of life will enter the human soul, even if it doesn't want it to, and cause it to live forever. in so many words, it sounds like it's saying, "no matter how hard you try to be anything different, you're an eternal being".

it's a very weird way of saying it though -- so, I have to wonder if this book was written to fallen-angels as an encoded message. one thing that supports this, may be the next thing he says:

> Study the truth of mustard life. Only the strong in God can act upon this teaching and hold the lower nature. The weak must wait its maturity and then will come their struggle. It will strive to keep the feet from the Path; and may succeed. But if once all its power be wiped out [...]

huh? only the "strong in God" can do apply this teaching in a way to hold the lower nature? what?! I thought the lower nature was bad? why does being "strong in God", allow one to keep their lower nature? I don't understand this at all. the implication here is that walter is weak, so he had his mustard tree cut will now be presented with a struggle that,

> [...] will seem to take the very life. That is because it takes the animal soul and throttles it. But the human soul will recover, and the Spirit come into it. This is the time of the Silence of the Soul. Then it shall be clear to you how dark are the lives of those who are around you and have no goal of union with the Spirit towards which to race. And you will see and know karma. Also you will see that because of your past incarnations your karma is inextricably interwoven with the karma of the world.

his struggle is his "two lovely little daughters, the greatest treasures of our lives, and oh, so carefully taught regarding life and shielded from its dangers" would soon die. I don't understand why he shielded them from life's dangers though...

anyway, soon after their death, he would find himself reinacting the scene he saw in the picture that phyris painted of him drowning in the ocean with his wife.

like I said, that part was suspicious to me because normally he would go to devachan, however, it seems that these encounters have tuned his perception to the astral, so upon his death he did not see from his spiritual body, but instead sees from his astral/psychic body.

I haven't fully figured it all out yet, but it seems like this "at-onement" with the "Father" stuff is an elaborate set of power-displays to get humans who are interested in having power to join the custodial brotherhood network and become obedient to "God" and do the will of the "Father" (the conceptual program which is inhabiting/controlling them).

like it says about the cutting human soul like the mustard plant (not seed), whether you like it or not, you're an eternal being. everyone gets there whichever path they choose. concepts (temporal trajectories, or entire species) do not behave 100% as expected in the presence of resistance. that's just how it works.

### septinary-body - mol lang's septinary body

I'll write this later, but it occurred to me just now that mol lang's septinary body can be explained a lot easier if he's describing the body of a conceptual being rather than a "creator" (human). I commented about this in @[dtp/notes], but I think I know the answer now after writing the last two sections. actually, I think I understand this whole book a lot better now.

he breaks down the parts as follows:
- the I AM, or ego
- the body of the spirit, or spirit-body
- the human soul
- the animal soul
- the astral reflection of the two lowest principles:

everything from source (4) up to desire (1) is missing. these are essentially all the non-physical counterparts to the physical ones (5-7). it appears that he has instead taken the (5-7) layers of perception and given them "bodies" and "souls". to me, and also when looking at how mol lang uses the word "soul" in the book is a non-physical implementation. to a person on devachan, it's impossible to know if they are interating with their own concept of something or a "soul". this means that the soul is a concept of someone that continues between incarnations.

in my 7 layers of perception, I have made 2 layers not-physical (1,3), 2 layers being a transition zone between their upper and lower layers (also a mix of physical and non-physical) (2,6), and finally 2 physical layers (5,7). the last one is the origin, centre, or midpoint where things begin to take on physical form, source (4).

the way that I have figured it out to be is that interactions of lower frequencies create higher frequency harmonics. that's all the non-physical stuff. or, in the physical plane, you can see how the interaction of physical objects produce an abstract vibration -- a feeling or a concept. when concepts interact, they produce logic and structure (3) and the highest frequency of all, desire (1). the best I can figure out, are so high frequency already, that if you create a higher frequency one, it just like has more (duration? longevity? dunno the word... sustain?) influence on more things, cause it resonates with more things. so for example a desire of a galaxy resonates with everything in it, just like a human desire resonates with everything in you (this is probably what causes spontaneous DNA mutations)

so, what it looks to me like he's done here is he's capped off the 1-4 layers, making the conceptual (Father) be the highest plane that these bodies can access. you'll notice that logic and structure (3) is missing. that means that the "Father" determines the logic, and so therefore requires obedience to the logic. you'll also notice that desire (1) is missing as well, which is likely why he recommends that one must follow the "will" (desire) of the "Father".

he also says that it isn't until one becomes a "creator" that the "Spirit of Life" enters him:

> Now, therefore, if a human soul shall not be cut down, yet shall not enter into life as a creator by reason that it wills not, then the Spirit of life everlasting shall go into it, and it shall contain itself, and therefore live forever.

the way it feels to me what he's saying is that at some point (hard to say with such convoluted wording with the mustard plant), it seems the Father will no longer cap off the upper layers and allow direct access to the non-physical, like a "creator" does.

this idea makes sense to me, because if I consider the fallen-angels concept as I originally came to it, then the fallen-angels were intentionally created to be the implementation of negative desire for the species -- the unwanted aspect. that conceptual programming is probably the "animal soul" here, and it would be located in the Father, making the Father the replacement for these guy's source.

it's kind of a funny concept, because if that's the case (and I kinda think it is), it's a perfect reflection of them because the most common behavioural attribute that I've noticed for the custodial brotherhood network is to convince the humans that they need to be the intermediaries between the people and "God" -- just like the "Father" is an intermediary between them and source and their own desires.

it would also has another poetic irony to it in that the custodial network likes to micromanage the procedure and logic of the way things are done; they have to be done the "right way" -- and manipulate ideology and punish people for not doing things the "right way" -- just like the "Father" is blocking access to their own desires, the "Father" is also interjecting logic and the process to get there -- and since it seems to move around a bit, no one can figure out the exact "right way" to do things, creating endless conflict and "my Father can beat your Father up" school-playground interactions between factions.

so what it looks like is that the "Father" has given an out for the fallen-angels. they *are* creators and eternal beings, just like everyone else is, and -- nothing is stopping them from being a creator.

I believe the reason why there is so much difficulty for them to come to this realisation, is that they believe so much in punishment and secrets, it's inconcievable to them that there is an open world outside of their prison world of punishment. this is why there's so much emphasis on "karma" and "atonement".

at-one-ment just means becoming one mind with the Father and doing his will with unwavering obedience -- a literally impossible task, just as "one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled" -- for, if that were possible, then you would cause every atom and the entire universe itself to make it's transition because you are related (relative, resonant) to something that is bigger than yourself. there is no way that you could ever find perfect harhony with all that. it's impossible to ever achieve that kind of perfection.
