### thoughts on dividing the way, book 2

this time in @[dtp/dtp](book-2) it's the perspective of walter pierson, a later incarnation of zailm who is being introduced to the brotherhood of the "lothtians".

#### nine-tenths - 9/10ths

in talking about how the secrets of the occult should not be revealed to the unclean masses (my words, not his), there is a particularly elitist and presumptutive quote that reminds me of "original sin"

> Nine-tenths of the people of this world are unable to govern themselves well; they cannot in saneness expect to be made sharers of such awful knowledge as Siva represents.

it says that 90% of people would do bad things if they had the power of shiva (like evidence-less murders and stuff).

this seems pretty strange to me, because I think that generally people are pretty peaceful. I've noticed that the people in high positions of power don't at all have a higher moral code. they're often times far far worse, and just hide it better. it's all marketing and public image after a certain income threshold. so, the "original sin" that *everyone* seems to have seems to be pretty false.

I don't want to say that people are blameless, not at all, but given the opportunity to live peacefully, most people choose the peaceful path. what it looks to me like is a corrupt institution (church or ancient kings, for example) is making an effort to convince others that their corrupt nature, is in fact normal for everyone to have -- while then creating a moral code by which the people are to follow, punishable, of course -- however, the corrupt institution (ancient kings or church) seems to be above the law.

this statement that 90% of people are incapable of of using power (so therefore it needs to be kept a secret), sounds exactly like the largest pedophile network condeming people for "sinning".

what I mean, is -- like a psychologist that projects their problem on to the patient, it sounds to me like the most commen misusers/abusers of this power are actually them, and they're trying to cover up for it by claiming that 90% of people would abuse the power.

if I make a statement like, "this program, while it's a good tool for stock traders, it's very easy to do insider trading. in the wrong hands, this could be abused to make a lot of money" -- you may wonder if I'm using the program myself in precisely the same way I said... so you just make a person disappear, and it just vanishes their body returning the energy back to source without a trace, huh?

> How long would it be until the world would find that the unscrupulous amongst men were using it to work undetectable murder?

I don't know, but I sincerely doubt it, and it's kind of a double standard too, because a dozen paragraphs later a guy shows up to vanish someone using exactly that force...

> I am come to induct one of thy number into the land of the departed, while another I take home with myself. To you, Lothins, I need not say that the body is like unto a coat, to be put off or on at pleasure-by those who know how.

so then, why is undetectable murder bad??? it sounds to me like it's just returning energy back to its source so it can extend out again. what's wrong with that? I see no problem with anyone's utilisation of "undetectable murder". I don't get it. I mean, think about for the moment a person who is severely depressed and does not want to carry on. instead of suicide, this is a painless and instant transition into devachan. isn't that, like a million times better than dying a decades slow death on pharmaceuticals?

#### spiritualists - mediums and spiritualists

mol lang keeps going on and on about spiritualists -- a term I had never heard of. it's a person who communicates with the dead.

anyway, he keeps emphasising that the communication with the "spirit" is not actually the spirit or the ego (the I AM). he seems to be emphasising that they are in fact communicating with the *psychic* or astral body of the person. this is not who the person really is.

OK, sure -- and this all seems to me like fighting against a weird strawman for me. it must have been a thing, though, today I don't know of any spiritualists or mediums. my view is expanded from that -- as, I believe one can tune into *anything* -- even like rocks or something can tell their story in the form of a concept. that is how they are already vibrating, so all you have to do is to tune to it.

anyway, as I was expressing my frustration of his fighting the windmill giants, it occurred to me that nosebook is likely communicating in a similar way with me while I speak. they're not speaking with who I really am (the I AM), but the psychic body that these mediums also interface with.

in the book, they have just left for the spiritual world, leaving first the physical bodies behind, then in a second stage, leaving their astral/psychic bodies behind.

it also occurred to me that the reason why my NDEs (see @[newblog](2022-02-21 05:42)), I went directly to this world, completely skipping the astral/psychic bodies' perception.

#### devachan-senses - devachan, the senses, and the father

mol lang explains to phylos that devachan is real, essentially because you can use your 5 senses there. he says that there are 7 senses though, adding intuition and another unnamed one.

he repeats an earlier explanation that earth is cause -- the place where you construct the concepts for you to live out in devachan. so, I guess the more concepts you acquire and tune to, the more rich your devachan reality will be.

the image it gives me is that consciousness is only as much as you tune yourself to. so, imagine someone who has an early or natal death -- their devachan would be essentially nothing. then, a person that constructs a lot of concepts (art, science, or emotion) with numerous interactions will have a very extensive devachan experience. after a while in devachan experiencing those concepts in a non-resistant environment, they tune you to a similarly tuned earth reality and you eventually incarnate again to live out those concepts, but this time in a resistant environment. physicl causes the reality/effect of the conceptual, and then the conceptual causes the reality of the next physical.

you kind of bounce back and fourth between these two infinitely, going every time to a higher plane of understanding and experience. for those that know alchemy, this is the "alchemical process" -- or in chemistry I think, but not sure it would be: "rinse, filter and decant"

the idea here is that each iteration, you begin to see reality for what it really is (what you make it out to be), no matter the conditions of earth (resistant, slow) or devachan (low resistance, instant). it really sounds like condensation and evaporation to me.

the closer one gets to attaining this, is the "return back to the Father" -- the attainment of the conditionless "long devachan" (nirvana) -- of which:

> only a few have done this as yet, and of these Jesus Christ of Beth-le-hem is so far the only One who can truly say, 'I and my Father are one.'

following @[dtp/thoughts](the-father), I think the "Father" is the conceptual world, out of which we're all born out of. it's possible that this was the first state we experienced, when things were much higher energy and perhaps closer to sirius. the prodigal son (us) and other things seem to say that the goal is to eventually return back to that "perfected" state, and experience earth and each other from that perspective.

so, what I think this means is -- is that he's claiming that jesus is the first person to be able to say "I am a conceptual being projecting myself down into the physical". there is no separation between me and the concept of myself.

#### nirvana - the long devachan, "nirvana"

it has been mentioned a few times now that nirvana is the state that we'll all be in after the death and rebirth process has allowed us to fully return to the "Father" (conceptual world). this means that from there, all of us are now conceptual beings that consciously creating what we want to create.

there's one problem that I have with that -- and that is stagnation or boredom. if everything is like devachan, then you would get tired of everything pretty quickly. everything is and only is your own concepts. it's a very closed environment where the maximum variety can only come out of the combination of all of your concepts. in that sense, nothing "new" (unexpected) can come out. in a sense, the universe is like that. all of us are mixtures of concepts the universe has -- and so in that way you are living in and experiencing your own isolated universe.

for new things to come out of somewhere you need something that appears "unwanted" -- so, some sort of conflict or diversity has to exist to continually retain some element of unwanted available to experience. like every ingredient available in the kitchen, you don't have to put all of them in whatever you're baking -- and neither do you only want to have ingredients for only a certain type of recipe; it's good to have a variety of things available, where unwanted is relative only to your creation.

so, to create such a place, I have postulated that the best way to have good aspects of both the physical and the conceptual, is to literally mix the two: devachan on earth.

in such a situation, no one can possibly die as you are always a reflection of how you conceptualise yourself to be -- and also there is no stagnation either because the whole environment is filled with so many of other people's creations.

under such a situation, one can easily imagine that rapidly we would have space considerations to deal with. not everyone can have a mansion, right?

I don't think it's a problem because this reality would kind of fragment (split) into many segments. at first there will probably be one major split, but then as people continue to create, it's pretty easy to see that other "incompatible" realities would emerge. it's clear that we would begin to clump into similar realities. each would be our own conception of our experience on earth, filled not only with other people and their concepts, but also with your own concepts.

it's my belief that jesus was the first one to achieve such a split because he accomplished equality with the "Father" -- meaning that his reality is a reflection of him. this was the first split. we will all achieve this though soon. I don't see it all clearly yet, but I believe that the "long devachan" has nothing to do with nothingness at all. I believe it's exactly the opposite: a full realisation of devachan here in the physical plane on earth.

---

I know this book keeps repeating the idea that there is no retrogression and one cannot bring devachan here to earth. I'll leave it at that for now... I'm just speculating of what *I* think the long devachan is. we all create our own realities, so go ahead and create yours however you want. those who wish to join you, will. there are many "mansions" to select from.

> They are peopled, but by beings of whom some are good, and some are evil; in the sight of the Eternal Cause, relatively good or evil. That which exists under laws inimical to man is evil to man, though not in itself evil. But these 'mansions' are set apart from one another that they may not interfere.

#### 7-senses - the 7 senses and the 7 days of creation

> Matter is a One Substantiality, having not a single quality which any human sense can cognize. But force also is one of the creations of the Father. And force hath two polarities, the positive and the negative, absolute opposites. Now man on earth hath certain senses; seven are these senses: sight, hearing, feeling, smelling, tasting, intuition, and one innominate. These last are not yet evolved, for the fullness of days is not come; the Fifth Day is; but the Sixth and the Seventh are not. With the last, man becometh greater than he hath ever been.

it's wierd how well this corresponds to the additions that I want to make to perception. at the moment we're aware of 5 physical senses, but the 6th there he labels as "intuition". in my system, after 5d, conceptual perception, one realises that concepts are in motion and have a trajectory to them. when this happens, temporal perception opens. I belive this is the same as what he calls "intuition". the reason why I say this is because feeling is a sense that is used both for physical sensation and also for emotion. that feeling will tune you to a point in time -- like a memory, past or future. you can also tune to another point in time in the present -- like how someone feels across from you. that is another point in time because it's a different perception into "reality". everything that differs from your "now" is another point in time, whether it's your trajectory or someone/something else's.

now, when you think of intuition, it's a sequence of those points in time which bring you to a conclusion, answer, result, or reality. intuition is a trajectory of feeling -- meaning it's temporal perception.

the final sense that he says is "innominate" is the one that I have labeled "YHVH" or "identity" -- which is the realisation that if "you" can be a trajectory through time, there is no real limit to who "you" is. you can be any conceptual derivative of yourself in both time or space. therefore, you can now begin to perceive yourself as the "Father" of all of the infinite concepts of yourself. if you "are" whatever you conceive yourself to "be" -- and you choose to see yourself as a rock, are you not a rock? isn't that real just like any other reality is real? out of that any and everything can be born. you, the "Son" have become the "Father" uncountable creations that now extend out of you.

if we're in the 5th day of creation, then there are probably still two more 1000y cycles to go until that's created. you know, that's not actually all that long... it's quite possible that jesus walked the earth only 1000y ago... think about how much has changed since.
