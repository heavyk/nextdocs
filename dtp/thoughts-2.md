### thoughts on dividing the way, book 2

this time in @[dtp/dtp](book-2) it's the perspective of walter pierson, a later incarnation of zailm who is being introduced to the brotherhood of the "lothtians".

#### nine-tenths - 9/10ths

in talking about how the secrets of the occult should not be revealed to the unclean masses (my words, not his), there is a particularly elitist and presumptutive quote that reminds me of "original sin"

> Nine-tenths of the people of this world are unable to govern themselves well; they cannot in saneness expect to be made sharers of such awful knowledge as Siva represents.

it says that 90% of people would do bad things if they had the power of shiva (like evidence-less murders and stuff).

this seems pretty strange to me, because I think that generally people are pretty peaceful. I've noticed that the people in high positions of power don't at all have a higher moral code. they're often times far far worse, and just hide it better. it's all marketing and public image after a certain income threshold. so, the "original sin" that *everyone* seems to have seems to be pretty false.

I don't want to say that people are blameless, not at all, but given the opportunity to live peacefully, most people choose the peaceful path. what it looks to me like is a corrupt institution (church or ancient kings, for example) is making an effort to convince others that their corrupt nature, is in fact normal for everyone to have -- while then creating a moral code by which the people are to follow, punishable, of course -- however, the corrupt institution (ancient kings or church) seems to be above the law.

this statement that 90% of people are incapable of of using power (so therefore it needs to be kept a secret), sounds exactly like the largest pedophile network condeming people for "sinning".

what I mean, is -- like a psychologist that projects their problem on to the patient, it sounds to me like the most commen misusers/abusers of this power are actually them, and they're trying to cover up for it by claiming that 90% of people would abuse the power.

if I make a statement like, "this program, while it's a good tool for stock traders, it's very easy to do insider trading. in the wrong hands, this could be abused to make a lot of money" -- you may wonder if I'm using the program myself in precisely the same way I said... so you just make a person disappear, and it just vanishes their body returning the energy back to source without a trace, huh?

> How long would it be until the world would find that the unscrupulous amongst men were using it to work undetectable murder?

I don't know, but I sincerely doubt it, and it's kind of a double standard too, because a dozen paragraphs later a guy shows up to vanish someone using exactly that force...

> I am come to induct one of thy number into the land of the departed, while another I take home with myself. To you, Lothins, I need not say that the body is like unto a coat, to be put off or on at pleasure-by those who know how.

so then, why is undetectable murder bad??? it sounds to me like it's just returning energy back to its source so it can extend out again. what's wrong with that? I see no problem with anyone's utilisation of "undetectable murder". I don't get it. I mean, think about for the moment a person who is severely depressed and does not want to carry on. instead of suicide, this is a painless and instant transition into devachan. isn't that, like a million times better than dying a decades slow death on pharmaceuticals?

#### spiritualists - mediums and spiritualists

mol lang keeps going on and on about spiritualists -- a term I had never heard of. it's a person who communicates with the dead.

anyway, he keeps emphasising that the communication with the "spirit" is not actually the spirit or the ego (the I AM). he seems to be emphasising that they are in fact communicating with the *psychic* or astral body of the person. this is not who the person really is.

OK, sure -- and this all seems to me like fighting against a weird strawman for me. it must have been a thing, though, today I don't know of any spiritualists or mediums. my view is expanded from that -- as, I believe one can tune into *anything* -- even like rocks or something can tell their story in the form of a concept. that is how they are already vibrating, so all you have to do is to tune to it.

anyway, as I was expressing my frustration of his fighting the windmill giants, it occurred to me that nosebook is likely communicating in a similar way with me while I speak. they're not speaking with who I really am (the I AM), but the psychic body that these mediums also interface with.

in the book, they have just left for the spiritual world, leaving first the physical bodies behind, then in a second stage, leaving their astral/psychic bodies behind.

it also occurred to me that the reason why my NDEs (see @[newblog](2022-02-21 05:42)), I went directly to this world, completely skipping the astral/psychic bodies' perception.

#### devachan-senses - devachan, the senses, and the father

mol lang explains to phylos that devachan is real, essentially because you can use your 5 senses there. he says that there are 7 senses though, adding intuition and another unnamed one.

he repeats an earlier explanation that earth is cause -- the place where you construct the concepts for you to live out in devachan. so, I guess the more concepts you acquire and tune to, the more rich your devachan reality will be.

the image it gives me is that consciousness is only as much as you tune yourself to. so, imagine someone who has an early or natal death -- their devachan would be essentially nothing. then, a person that constructs a lot of concepts (art, science, or emotion) with numerous interactions will have a very extensive devachan experience. after a while in devachan experiencing those concepts in a non-resistant environment, they tune you to a similarly tuned earth reality and you eventually incarnate again to live out those concepts, but this time in a resistant environment. physicl causes the reality/effect of the conceptual, and then the conceptual causes the reality of the next physical.

you kind of bounce back and fourth between these two infinitely, going every time to a higher plane of understanding and experience. for those that know alchemy, this is the "alchemical process" -- or in chemistry I think, but not sure it would be: "rinse, filter and decant"

the idea here is that each iteration, you begin to see reality for what it really is (what you make it out to be), no matter the conditions of earth (resistant, slow) or devachan (low resistance, instant). it really sounds like condensation and evaporation to me.

the closer one gets to attaining this, is the "return back to the Father" -- the attainment of the conditionless "long devachan" (nirvana) -- of which:

> only a few have done this as yet, and of these Jesus Christ of Beth-le-hem is so far the only One who can truly say, 'I and my Father are one.'

following @[dtp/thoughts](the-father), I think the "Father" is the conceptual world, out of which we're all born out of. it's possible that this was the first state we experienced, when things were much higher energy and perhaps closer to sirius. the prodigal son (us) and other things seem to say that the goal is to eventually return back to that "perfected" state, and experience earth and each other from that perspective.

so, what I think this means is -- is that he's claiming that jesus is the first person to be able to say "I am a conceptual being projecting myself down into the physical". there is no separation between me and the concept of myself.

#### nirvana - the long devachan, "nirvana"

it has been mentioned a few times now that nirvana is the state that we'll all be in after the death and rebirth process has allowed us to fully return to the "Father" (conceptual world). this means that from there, all of us are now conceptual beings that consciously creating what we want to create.

there's one problem that I have with that -- and that is stagnation or boredom. if everything is like devachan, then you would get tired of everything pretty quickly. everything is and only is your own concepts. it's a very closed environment where the maximum variety can only come out of the combination of all of your concepts. in that sense, nothing "new" (unexpected) can come out. in a sense, the universe is like that. all of us are mixtures of concepts the universe has -- and so in that way you are living in and experiencing your own isolated universe.

for new things to come out of somewhere you need something that appears "unwanted" -- so, some sort of conflict or diversity has to exist to continually retain some element of unwanted available to experience. like every ingredient available in the kitchen, you don't have to put all of them in whatever you're baking -- and neither do you only want to have ingredients for only a certain type of recipe; it's good to have a variety of things available, where unwanted is relative only to your creation.

so, to create such a place, I have postulated that the best way to have good aspects of both the physical and the conceptual, is to literally mix the two: devachan on earth.

in such a situation, no one can possibly die as you are always a reflection of how you conceptualise yourself to be -- and also there is no stagnation either because the whole environment is filled with so many of other people's creations.

under such a situation, one can easily imagine that rapidly we would have space considerations to deal with. not everyone can have a mansion, right?

I don't think it's a problem because this reality would kind of fragment (split) into many segments. at first there will probably be one major split, but then as people continue to create, it's pretty easy to see that other "incompatible" realities would emerge. it's clear that we would begin to clump into similar realities. each would be our own conception of our experience on earth, filled not only with other people and their concepts, but also with your own concepts.

it's my belief that jesus was the first one to achieve such a split because he accomplished equality with the "Father" -- meaning that his reality is a reflection of him. this was the first split. we will all achieve this though soon. I don't see it all clearly yet, but I believe that the "long devachan" has nothing to do with nothingness at all. I believe it's exactly the opposite: a full realisation of devachan here in the physical plane on earth.

---

I know this book keeps repeating the idea that there is no retrogression and one cannot bring devachan here to earth. I'll leave it at that for now... I'm just speculating of what *I* think the long devachan is. we all create our own realities, so go ahead and create yours however you want. those who wish to join you, will. there are many "mansions" to select from.

> They are peopled, but by beings of whom some are good, and some are evil; in the sight of the Eternal Cause, relatively good or evil. That which exists under laws inimical to man is evil to man, though not in itself evil. But these 'mansions' are set apart from one another that they may not interfere.

#### 7-senses - the 7 senses and the 7 days of creation

> Matter is a One Substantiality, having not a single quality which any human sense can cognize. But force also is one of the creations of the Father. And force hath two polarities, the positive and the negative, absolute opposites. Now man on earth hath certain senses; seven are these senses: sight, hearing, feeling, smelling, tasting, intuition, and one innominate. These last are not yet evolved, for the fullness of days is not come; the Fifth Day is; but the Sixth and the Seventh are not. With the last, man becometh greater than he hath ever been.

it's wierd how well this corresponds to the additions that I want to make to perception. at the moment we're aware of 5 physical senses, but the 6th there he labels as "intuition". in my system, after 5d, conceptual perception, one realises that concepts are in motion and have a trajectory to them. when this happens, temporal perception opens. I belive this is the same as what he calls "intuition". the reason why I say this is because feeling is a sense that is used both for physical sensation and also for emotion. that feeling will tune you to a point in time -- like a memory, past or future. you can also tune to another point in time in the present -- like how someone feels across from you. that is another point in time because it's a different perception into "reality". everything that differs from your "now" is another point in time, whether it's your trajectory or someone/something else's.

now, when you think of intuition, it's a sequence of those points in time which bring you to a conclusion, answer, result, or reality. intuition is a trajectory of feeling -- meaning it's temporal perception.

the final sense that he says is "innominate" is the one that I have labeled "YHVH" or "identity" -- which is the realisation that if "you" can be a trajectory through time, there is no real limit to who "you" is. you can be any conceptual derivative of yourself in both time or space. therefore, you can now begin to perceive yourself as the "Father" of all of the infinite concepts of yourself. if you "are" whatever you conceive yourself to "be" -- and you choose to see yourself as a rock, are you not a rock? isn't that real just like any other reality is real? out of that any and everything can be born. you, the "Son" have become the "Father" uncountable creations that now extend out of you.

if we're in the 5th day of creation, then there are probably still two more 1000y cycles to go until that's created. you know, that's not actually all that long... it's quite possible that jesus walked the earth only 1000y ago... think about how much has changed since.

### mysterious-stranger - merton fowler and the mysterious stranger

in @[dtp/dtp](chapter-2-4), he goes to meet an inventor who is very conceited. strangely enough, some weird things happen when I'm reading it. my heart started racing and I immediately thought of tesla. I was waiting for the book to say it was tesla but it instead said that he minted mis own coins and designed trains. that inventor was, "merton fowler".

I did searches for who that is, but only found opbituaries of people with the same name. since it's in such a influential book, I would've assumed someone *must* have written something about it somewhere.. not even speculation as to who that could be. even github doesn't have any mention of it at all. it doesn't even show up in password lists (that are on github) or anything[^1].

I can't remember when it happened, but as I was reading this introduction to merton fowler, I hear this nearly audible voice in my head that said "you", in response to my unspoken thought of "I wonder who merton fowler is?" a lot of stuff goes on in my head, and if I were to believe every voice in my head, I would be very confused. I hear voices in my head all the time.

#### who is the author?

another thing caught my eye too, because in merton fowler's world, there is an unnamed author:

> The Falls were in the devachanic realm of an author, who, while on earth, was a very pleasing writer, albeit extravagantly hopeful in his imaginative excursions and thought plays. This was, indeed, doubtless the reason of his popularity as an author. His mind dwelt on the sublime in nature, and on the good, the true, and the beautiful. Here in his heaven he lived his books, and found all about him the characters, the emotions, the delicate imagery and the sublime beauty which made his pages seem real to their readers

it never says who the author is, but it says that merton fowler made him an organ:

> I asked where the Falls were situated, and the inventor, Fowler, replied that a certain author of his acquaintance lived there, and had the pleasure of listening to a mammoth pipe organ made for him by the inventor, "By myself! All men whatever," said this egotist, "are beneficiaries of mine, and recognize me as the chiefest of human kind, and greatest of all living people!"

feeling like this author perhaps could be mark twain because twain was also a writer that was good friends with tesla, I type in "mark twain organ" into google, and it comes up "twain's lament - organ music from mysterious stranger" I was very surprised to see the words "mysterious stranger" because in a few notable places in the book, those words are used as a title.

even wierder is in the introduction (@[dtp/dtp](weird-intro)), the guy from sacred-texts.com making this text available and adding on his own apocalytic prophecy to the beginning thanks an "Invisible Helper" for making it all possible. for some reason, when I read that the first time, I read "mysterious stranger" rather than "invisible helper" -- and remembered it that way.

---

it turns out that mark twain had a manuscript called "mysterious stranger" he had revised a few times (but never published) about a guy named satan, who consequently was the nephew of the biblical satan. he convinces people that he can fortell the future with magical feats (power-displays). the more people believe in him, the more he prophesies bad things... sound familiar? maybe a little bit like jehova or this "christ"? weird, right?

I do a search in the book for the words "mysterious stranger". the very first one is in the preface (@[dtp](preface)) where the amanuensis calls phylos the mysterious stranger:

> [speaking about phylos...] after a long narration to both parents, they expressed a desire to hear the mysterious stranger also. This he would not grant, but permitted me to quote his words, talks and addresses, and at length I became so proficient that I could repeat what he said almost as fast as he spoke to me.

the next one was the guy by the fountain that gives zailm a prophecy about his future "sin" or failure.

> Were the words of the mysterious stranger true, or false?

the next one is the guy who showed up and ruled the land for 434 days, reforming the laws of atl government and installing the maxin-stone.

> It is needless to say the proof was satisfactory, and thereafter the mysterious stranger revised the laws and provided then the code which had ever since governed the land. He had said that whosoever should add to or take from his laws, that person should not come into the Kingdom of Incal until "I am come on earth for the final judgment."

the final one is when lolix is convincing zailm to love her, he's reminded of the mysterious stranger by the fountain:

> The last barrier was fallen. Conscience slumbered. Thoughts of Anzimee were put aside as one would shun an accusing angel. Did I think of Pitach Rhok and my days of sinlessness? Or of the mysterious stranger whom I had heard in awe in the first of my life at Caiphul?

---

so here's the weird thing: I read the plot synopsis of the "mysterious stranger" script and besides it being literary fraud (taking various of twain's works and mixing them together), the ending for this one (which I think twain wrote) has satan show the boys all kinds of religous fanatism, trials, burnings, etc. and explains it all by saying,

        There is no God,
        No universe,
        No human race,
        No earthly life,
        No heaven,
        No hell

        It is all a dream--
        A grotesque and foolish dream

        Nothing exists but you.
        And you are a thought--
        
        A vagrant thought,
        A useless thought,
        A homeless thought,

        Wandering forelorn
        Among the empty eternities

---

there is a lot there, so let's assimilate this. the "mysterious stranger" in twain's manuscript is a prophet that tells of future calamaties -- just like the man at the fountain. later, the man at the fountain is revealed to be the "christ"

> Then a glorious radiance broke over the scene, and the Cross Bearer was beside us as we stood, clasping each other and our child. He whom I had seen by the moonlit fountain, years before, stood by us again. On His breast shone a Cross of Fire, which leapt or fell again in waves of undulating, living Light.

...who also gives prophecy of future calamity and performs magical feats to get people to believe him -- exactly like the nephew of satan in the novel.

the amanuensis identifies phylos as the "mysterious stranger" in the preface, and twain's novel ends with the nephew of satan telling you in a poem, that says:

- There is no God
- It is all a dream
- Nothing exists but you

so, I'm the creater of my own reality, huh? you're saying there is no "God" (outside of myself), and nothing exists but me (so I'm God)? I'm also the prophet of my own calamity, so I'm also "Satan" too?

all of this is told in a chapter where they are traveling through the vast world of an inventor where everything is his own conception, others join him in his dream, and he thinks he is the greatest of all men:

> By myself! All men whatever, are beneficiaries of mine, and recognize me as the chiefest of human kind, and greatest of all living people!

this book is NUTS...

#### irony of the book

for a book that is trying its hardest to try and prove that there is a "God", a "Father", and a "Christ" all using power-displays, -- the author (phylos) *must* have known the irony of using the words "mysterious stranger" to describe the "christ".

not just the "christ" though; phylos, jehova, and mendocus are *also* using power-displays to garner belief coupled with prophesies of future calamity. this whole book is filled with people that need manifestations (power-displays) to believe boost their confidence in theirselves or the laws.

all of this is happening in a chapter describing an inventor that is looking to create a "christless" world:

> That man is arranging his concepts of a Christless life as gained on earth. When all is assimilated, he will recarnify on earth, and from his early childhood self-conceit and self-admiration will be his ruling characteristics. [...] out of his future egotism will arise self-confidence. His spirituality of temperament is large, his animal qualities well balanced and strong, and the good of all his conceit will manifest itself next as a governor of those forces which will lead men forward.

it's saying that this inventor wants to create a christless world. christless means no saviour, which means no thing outside of yourself will be creating your reality for you. you attract, and therefore create, your *own* personal reality -- your own "mansion" in the "Father". by creating a christless reality, he's sort of putting the creation of these "mansions" into the hands of the people, rather than the most initiated or adept.

this chapter sort of un-does everything this book tries to accomplish. if there is no christ, there's no sin, and if there's no sin, there's no need to at-one yourself to anything except your own self and your own desires.

the way the dialogue goes, it's very difficult to perceive the implications of what it's saying, so it took me making the connection through the "mysterious stranger" reference.

additionally, "christless" is nearly the same thing as saying "anti-christ" -- for which the message of this book is given by a 

the chapter is very ironic in that sense...

#### did twain help tesla to self-sabotage?

I went for a walk to think about this and it occurred to me that it's quite possible that mark twain helped tesla to self-sabotage this timeline -- quite possibly even with this story.

wikipedia says that all of the 5 different versions/fragments of the story were written after this book was written (according to the amanuensis, 1894), so it's quite possible that twain could have been inspired to write his novel as well, after this had already been written, thereby placing a bit of irony into this document.

perceived symbols (like a dream or vision) can alter a timeline dramatically. a textual symbol can do-so as well. when I was in berlin I learned from some "time travelers" (their claim, not mine) how to use symbols to attract the future. I've learned a lot about how to do that since and -- essentially you just put symbols (that mean something to you) out in a place for others to see, and their contemplation of those symbols makes their version of that symbolic reality. it's not your version of the symbol, as they can be interpretted any way perceived -- and so, as with all things, wanted-and-unwanted-are-same.

symbols are to timelines as media is to communication. the medium *is* the message.


this symbolic manipulation to self-sabotage may be the very origins (and evidence) of the *iteratively self-sabotage your succcesses to build more velocity cause nothing is really lost cause it's all attration* -- technique. (as you'll see in the next sections)

the final bit of irony for a book working so hard to produce a "christ", is that in a "christless" reality where everything you perceive is an extension of or resonant with your own concepts of reality, then there is nobody there to save you -- no saviour. if there's no one to save you, you *must* gain self-confidence because there's nobody to carry your cross for you. *you!*, are the alpha and also the omega.

#### how does this self-sabotage fit into the bigger picture?

since I believe we're on tesla's self-sabotaged timeline, and as mentioned above, I find it likely that the things rendered in twain's "mysterious stranger" not only affected tesla, but also changed the trajectory of this timeline in the reception of this book. "mysterious stranger" takes a very critical look at this book. I've only read the plot from tvtropes, but it seems that handsome (appearance) satan uses power-displays to become attractive to the boys and also the girls, and then uses their elevated perception of him to get them to believe in the calamaties he prophesises. knowing LOA, we know that "satan" here is just exploiting the "rapport" he built up with them to get the kids to attract that disaster -- just like jehova or "christ", "satan" in this novella is doing the same thing.

I feel it's pretty plausible that twain conversed with tesla about these ideas presented in the "mysterious stranger". tesla also spent the later part of his life in eastern philosophy and things like that nature. he wrote about moses and the ark of the covenant, and studied the great pyramid at length, so he was studying the science laws governing the "magic" of the power-displays. tesla himself was also a bit of a magician using his own types of power-displays to build up buzz for his inventions.

I feel very strongly that some combination of these symbols must have altered the trajectory of tesla's life just as "satan" did to the lives of the boys in that story. it's like a play within a play[^2].

if that's true, then it's very likely to be self-sabotage (ie. them affecting theirselves from the future or from another timeline), which means that paves the way for a reality where there isn't a need for power-displays. that's probably where I come in. it's kind of like tag-team.

this is just a theory to explain that tag-team idea, but I often times wonder about tesla's older brother that died early on. conceptually, he feels to me like JTB does for jesus. this is the hero-twins trope, where one self-sacrifices so that the other can rise.

going on that a bit further, in the sirian guide, I can't remember how it goes exactly, but the three triads presented, feel to me like the same two dudes interacting with "venus". she takes on different roles in their various stages of development, but never the physical ones -- the dudes do that. I can't remember the first triad, but the second, osiris is paired with ra. the third triad (I think) vulcan is paired with thoth. what I remember is that the osiris/vulcan guy (different incarnations), is always paired with the ra/thoth guy, so osiris+ra, and vulcan+thoth.

conceptually speaking, let's assume that these are the archetypical hero twins. one is successful (in their own element/ray) -- while the other self-sacrifices to allow the first to rise. one of them is physically oriented while the other is conceptually oriented... kind of like personifications of the difference between conceptual devachan and physical earth.

the "christ" in this book is obviously a magician relying on power-displays and things of that nature, so very clearly falls into the hands of ra/thoth. the "christ" in this book identifies himself as the perfected 7th ray. "satan" in the "mysterious stranger" is also the magician 7th ray type.

merton, is obviously the conceptual type, much more like 5th ray vulcan than 7th ray thoth. 

so, what I see happening is that there are (at least) two earths, and these physical conceptual types go back and fourth gaining power by self-sacrificing their successes so that the other can do it the opposite way.

vulcan finds success conceptually and subjectively, and then from a future standpoint (think leapfrogging time pickles) sabotages it so that thoth can come and win everyone over with power-displays, laws, sensational marketing, and good looks.

he then, from that future standpoint, knowing that humans will arrive to where he is in the "future", he self-sabotages his own success and allows vulcan to once again find a subjective/conceptual success.

it's basically like taking the conceptual/devachan and physical/earth condensation/evaporation cycle and doing it on a macro scale as well as the micro.

---

the number of earths doing this can be infinite. they don't even need to exist on the same timeline for it to work, and everyone can try out being a "christ" of a physical or conceptual nature -- just pair with your conjugate.

this explanation of the leapfrogging physical/conceptual "christ"/anti-christ is the "linear" (derivative) perspective of my extra two perceptive dimensions (temporal+YHVH) and mol lang's explanation of clumps of people occupying different "mansions" in the "Father".


#### thoughts on merton fowler

I find his name to be really weird and I also really dislike his description in the book as well. to sort this out, I decided to look up what his name means.

"mer" is ocean or water
"ton" as a terminal seems to mean "unit"

ocean unit, I guess..

I took fowler to mean, someone who turns things fowl -- and, I suppose fowl could mean "wild bird" or "rotten".

internet says merton in old english means pool enclosure or lake settlement. fowler means someone who hunts wild birds.

my definition is interesting because it's opposites. it either turns fowl (ie. self-sabotage) or it turns into a wild bird (ie. freedom).

prolly means nothing... anyway, as I was reading, I noticed a strong sense of how I hated his inventions. I find them to be very inefficient. all transportation requires an engineer. automation, dude! he also likes minting money -- ugh, I really dislike money. I do like coins more than bills though (2(euros) coin is my favourite), and I would *never* put my face on a coin; that's so pretentious and ridiculous. and, "the people's man" -- lol, is he a dictator or something??

there is a lot I don't like about this guy. as an inventor, I like tesla much much better, however tesla bothers me in other ways -- mostly because he's so visual and perfection oriented (hence why I too think edison is more similar to me). I believe perfection to be a lofty ideal and prefer the diversity of difference. as such, I like how he things *feel* more than how they look -- though we share a common affection for efficiency --  something which merton did not at all have.

TODO: note the apparent missing section in the text.

#### final irony

the biggest irony of the world that this book aims to explore (the subjective/conceptual devachan), *also* must be christless -- unless, of course, you add that concept into it -- and so therefore the "christ" is your world is *your* concept of the christ; it's not outside of you. so, inotherwords, you are your own "Christ" in your subjective world, too.

restated, a christ can only exist in the physical/objective world, because in a subjective/conceptual world, the christ (outside of yourself) would be your concept of what a christ is, come to save you from the environment you created and other concepts in that environment, also created by you.

[1]: it seems *very* strange to me that there would be so few results. if I take virtually any first and last name and put them into a search engine at this point, I should expect to find *something*. there seem to be tens to hundreds of "merton fowler"s that have lived recently too, so it's just weird that there are so few search results. it feels pretty weird, almost as if something is out of place or being hidden. I remember when I used to be able to use google to find all sorts of interesting things on the internet -- even tons of strange geocities pages and everything. now, it feels like the internet has grown a LOT smaller. anyway, I digress..

[2]: I'm sorta insinuating that a very similar thing probably happened with edward de vere as well, as I think he too self-sabotaged himself with his own symbols as well. I downloaded "a midsummer's night dream" and it looks very much to be that way. with the fairy characters, "cobweb", "moth" (reference to what destroys earthly treasures) and "mustardseed" (as in faith like a mustardseed can move mountains and nothing will be impossible to you). additionally, there's nick bottom that wants to play all the parts -- just like the line that "satan" says, "Nothing exists but you" and "It is all a dream"... a play within a play.

### devachan-rebirth - the tuning of the soul

> the life between the grave and the cradle, life in the world of effects, is a life of assimilation of results due to causes set in operation while on earth, the world of causality. It is the character-forming realm, where effects are so arranged as to present them as causes in the succeeding earth life; not in the shape of segregate influences, but as traits of character, giving rise to well-defined policies in life on the part of individuals. Like attracts like, and if parents have certain influences governing their lives at critical times, the soul in devachan, which is perforce seeking rebirth on earth, will seize the opportunity presented of finding its similars, similars at that time, though perhaps at that time only, like itself, but never so before, possibly never to be so again; suffice it if there be a concordant trinity at the time.

this bit has an interesting part in it that says that the devachanee:

> It is the character-forming realm, [...] as traits of character, giving rise to well-defined policies in life on the part of individuals. Like attracts like, [...]

he's basically saying that in devachan you become a different character -- and then because "like attracts like" (aka LOA), you attract a different life for yourself based on the new character that you have become.

in another part he says that this always builds on the previous versions of you... no regression.
