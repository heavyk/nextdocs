??? - the tick saves a cat (venus?)



### s01e05 - the breadmaster

- *first bread incident* the bread consumes the tick and he feels warm and wants to stay there forever
  - arthur throws tick a lifesaver and saves him from the bread
  - "arthur you've given me another shot at this thing called life"
  - tells stu (who has to rebuild his store), "here, you can rebuild with these: cottony swabs"
- *second bread incident*, tick eats the whole thing
- the breadmaster is annoyed that tick thwarted his efforts so he threatens to increase bread bombings if the city doesn't give him the ingredients he needs
  - the mayor agrees (has an eagle on podium) and says it isn't an act of terrorism, just fast baking
  - also weird because the mayor is giving him the ingredients he needs to perform the act of terrorism.
- tick and arthur try to stop them from getting the ingredients, when they get to the sugar (bread can be baked just fine without sugar)
- *third bread incident* time they get stuck inside the bread roll and tick opens up a space that appears pretty feminine and arthur uses his wings to cut them out of the roll (reminded me of a womb)
- they go to the municipal pool where he's mixing his ingredients:
  - flour
  - eggs
  - milk 
  - (no sugar)
- tick does an epic dive off of the diving board and catches the breadmaster and pat.
- even though the breadmaster is stopped, *fourth bread incident* cannot be stopped because self-baking bread is already mixed in the at the munincipal pool. it's starting to consume the whole city (ie. all nosebook)
  - they decide that a sonic boom (a really loud noise will stop it froh rising)
  - the tick wakes the human bullet up and tells him to put triple charge
  - the tick flying through the air and the definitely has a penis shape for some of the frames
  - he hits the roll and it explodes all over the city
  - he's standing in front of the munincipal pool and there's a painting behind him:
    - a mermaid with a trident (neptune) with a smile on his face.
    - it looks like he's helping two people toward a third one on a boat.
    - the sun is shining brightly
  - tick monologues:
    - "the city looks almost peaceful under a blanket of freshly fallen suffle"
    - "but, let us not forget the lesson that we can learn from this arthur: that man was not meant to tamper with any of the four basic food groups"
  - I'm assuming the "four basic food groups" are: flour, eggs, milk, and sugar
    - two are from animals (shepherding) and two are from plants (farming)
