### intro and interesting aspects of the book

the book has a number of unique perspectives that I find to be very different than the standard "bible" format. the book starts with the prayer (desire) of people. out of much war, termoil, and fragile power structures and empires emerges a desire to know the etheric world.

the book splits reality into 3 basic levels:
- corporeal (physical)
- atmospheric (astral)
- etheric (conceptual)

it neglects the midpoint and the other *non-physical* planes (desire, logic, and relational). the book says that corporeal is physical and can be *seen*, however the atmospheric and etheric worlds ("es") are *not seen*.

### seeing is believing

as mentioned above, jehova is *only* concerned with the seen and the unseen worlds.

> 04/1.2. He said, I AM! And He comprehended all things, the seen and the unseen. Nor is there anything in all the universe that is not part of Him.

in my 7-layers-of-perception, jehova is essentially saying he only exists in 5-7. this is perfectly fine for me. the other really important thing to note is that *seeing* is what makes something physical or spiritual, and so that means that dogs and animals have a different corporeal world than we do because they *see* things we do not.

I use the terms "physical" and "non-physical" because for me, the conceptual world is not visible but it *is* physical. this idea of reality only being composed of seen and unseen things is a very oppressive topic in the christian bible, where seeing is believing. if I can see it, then I believe it -- and so therefore anyone who can create a convincing enough image can get believers (power-displays).

this seeing is believing thing has a long history all the way back to moses, with the commandment to make no images and aaron's of golden calf. seems that for the hebrew peoples, if they can see it, they can believe it. put this into context of where hollywood is today, the 9/11 attacks, FOX/CNN news, and anyone else who can create an image is the one that is creating reality that people will believe in. jehova seems to be driving this point home a bit.

you could say that my distinction between physical and non-physical, is unnecessary, but consider that physical things can be both seen and unseen. however, non-physical things cannot be seen. they can be translated into a physical representation or referred to with a symbol or an operation, but no amount of divinity will every make addition or subtraction a physical thing that someone can see or hold.

### jehova as universe (but probably galaxy)

in the beginning of the book, it defines the word "Jehovih" (jehova) as being synonymous with the universe. later on jehova makes "God" as chief over the angels.

in later places, it appears that jehova is not the universe though. I haven't read enough of the book yet to say for sure but it seems to me that jehova could possibly be thought of, not as the universe, but as the galaxy. jehova is a ethereal (conceptual) construct that desires for creation to reach up to his ethereal (conceptual) level.

the very interesting thing about it is that jehova seems to have two sides to him in that one side he has a lot of commandments and obedience, and *LOVES* power structures, at the same time he says that you really only can find it out for yourself [TODO: find reference]

the reason why I say galaxy is because kuthumi states that other galaxies do not have physical planes. we can see other galaxies with our radio telescopes, and we can say that something is there, but whether they have hydrogen and the other physical elements exactly like we do, we can't be sure. they probably have a system of elements which are sustained by galactic vibrations, but if this galaxy is special in that we're the only ones (so far) with a physical plane, their "elements" are likely quite different representations of those vibrations than we think they are (ie. the redshift problem) -- and so they may have a whole different concept of what the "physical" world is composed of, even though they likely share very generic concepts like schools, living places, landscapes, environments, etc.

### the harvest

it appears that somehow jehova inherited a bunch of atmospherian (astral) spirits (angels) that reside in the lower heavans. the angels that have gained enough maturity and capability will ascend up to the ethereal plane to be with jehova. this supposedly happens every 3000y, and every 3ky a new set of Gods and Lords are given dominion over the earth and its heavans.

the book lists a ridiculous amount of iterations on the harvests, who was the "God" and how many angels did they cause to ascend up to the ethereal realms. at some point, there are no more angels that wish to ascend anymore (this reminds me of kuthumi's mention of the INFECTED ONES no longer responding to rehabilitation). what strikes me is how many numbers there are. talk about a cosmic measuring contest.

I haven't got to this part yet, but I did skim ahead and noticed that there are some "false Gods" that show up -- and guess what, they're builders and are very concerned about measurements (anubis measures the person's soul and judges them, osiris says that measurement is the )

### false god osiris and measurement

the book depicts osiris in a very opposite way to the sirians. they say that osiris wanted to become the main "sun king" (pharoah) and that measurement was his deal. the picture has him as a centaur (man+horse) his right hand up like hitler. his opposite side is isis, and she is a two-faced female centaur with one having an arrow (diana?) and the other a sword (athena?).

it's weird that this book depicts the triad as two females and one male. the sirians describe isis: "Isis is a radiate, kind, gentle, caring and genuinely concerned person. She makes a great hostess and guest." -- the complete opposite.

the sirians have isis paired with osiris and ra -- who is said to have created "religion" and is as +3 male (ie. lots of measurement). you could imagine that if ra considered himself to be the supreme sun king, being a +3, he is saying he is higher than isis (-2), who matches what the sirians say our solar system is (-2).

so if ra is the "highest" (one extreme) at +3, he would need to make his lowest (other extreme), which would be thoth (+7), and so it would only then be natural to think that out of thoth would be born out of ra, and be deeply involved in measurement and pyramid building.

the false osiris also presents himself as a saviour of mankind (ie jeortau), which was also very unlike the sirian description of him. the sirians did say that jeortau, and ra created "diplomatic schemes" and thoth joined them for their "diplomatic tours".

so, again all of this is opposite.

### creation of man and the tree of life

there are many angels that have not corporeal bodies, jehova makes adam, out of the plant vegetation of the planet (it's like a gree pond scum) -- the same precursor to trees, plants, and animals (DNA?), and calls adam the tree and gives the tree life (and spirit).

the angels could freely put on bodies and take them off at the time, but if the angels procreated with the tree of life (adam), then the angels would lose their angelic qualities, become procrators and become dead to the heaven from which they come (ie. fall).

the angels intermingled with the race of adam (asu) and became the a mix of angels and asu called "man"

after that, jehova takes the earth out of the vegetative stage, causing the angels to lose their "corporeal" bodies again (so like they're back to being astral?). the next line says:

> 04/6.19. Jehovih said: Because you have raised up those who shall be joint heirs in heaven, you shall tread the earth with your feet, and walk by the sides of the new born, being guardian angels over them, for they are of your own flesh and kin.

the new born is "man" and so I'm assuming "you" is referring to the angels, saying they will walk with feet and be "guardian angels" over them (man).

man is special though, because of the angels' interaction with them in the creation, man's birthright is the etherian (conceptual) world.

---

after that, corporeal earth passes away, and the first race of man (asu) goes away, but the spirits remain intact inside of jehova and will come to incarnate the next generation of humans (i'hins)

### everything has a unique spirit (source)

> 04/6.21. As I have quickened the seed of the first born, so will I quicken all seed to the end of the earth. And each and every man-child and woman-child born into life I will quicken with a new spirit, which shall proceed out of Me at the time of conception. Neither will I give to any spirit of the higher or lower heaven power to enter a womb, or a fetus of a womb, and be born again.

a while back, I was contemplating what a "spirit", "soul", or "source" is (@[newblog](2022-03-21 22:25)), and I came to the conclusion that every new thing gets a new "spirit" which resonates with it's parent concepts (which have parent concepts and so on), and this could be a objectified way to look at resonance. instead of saying that they are resonant, they can be seen now as individual entities.

keep in mind that your "spirit" or "source" (probably what this book is calling etheric) does not have any resistance associated with it and is eternal (ie. no resistance). the psychic body (sometimes called the source), is the location from where these "angels" are coming from.. they're called "atmospheric" (astral) entities that could take on physical bodies, but after procreating with the tree of life are now earth-bound.

### jehova creates "God" as "Chief" over the earth

    04/7.6. Behold the work you have taken in hand! It was commanded to you all, to partake of all the fruits of the earth except of the fruit of the tree of life, which is of the knowledge of the earth and heaven, lest you lose your inheritance in etherea.

    04/7.7. Behold, you now have sons and daughters on the earth; by your love to them you have become bound spirits of the lower heaven. Until you redeem them in wisdom and power even to the sixth generation, you shall not rise again and inherit My emancipated heavens.

    04/7.8. To which end you shall be co-workers with one another in system and order. In My name you shall become an organic body and known as the heaven of the earth, or lower heaven, which shall travel with the earth.
    
    04/7.9. And I will allot to you a Chief, who is wise in experience in founding heavenly kingdoms; and he shall appoint from among you, officers, messengers, ashars, asaphs, and es’enaurs, and you shall be numbered and apportioned to your labor and places, like in My other lower heavens on other worlds.
    
    04/7.10. He who is Chief shall be called God of this heaven and the earth, which are now bestowed to his making.
    
    04/7.11. And God shall have a Council and throne within his heavenly city; and the place shall be called Hored, because it is the first kingdom of God in this firmament.
    
    04/7.12. And God shall rule on his throne, for it is his; and his Council shall rule with him; in My name they shall have dominion over angels and mortals belonging to the earth.
    
    04/7.13. And God shall appoint Chiefs under him who shall go down and dwell on the earth with mortals; and the labor of these Chiefs shall be with mortals for their resurrection. And these Chiefs shall be called Lords, for they are Gods of land, which is the lowest rank of My commissioned Gods.
    
    04/7.14. And God and his Lords shall have dominion from two hundred years to a thousand or more years; but never more than three thousand years. According to the regions of dan (light) into which I bring the earth, so shall the terms be for the office of My Gods and My Lords.

very interesting revelation that every 3ky a new power structure "God" is given power over earth and the angels.

### the text is only as good as the translator

this book has a lot less luminosity to it than dtp does, and I think that's because dtp's amanuensis received the book in reverse order, so he didn't really have much preconceived ideas on it to taint the translation. the security mechanism that this book has to allow content to pass through the editing (astral influence) that these channelers experience is to say the same story from two different perspectives. a really good example of this is the creation myth. I talked about the creation of man being a sort of trap for the angels (which later become the "harvest" for the Gods and Lords to measure their success at the end of each 3ky cycle). however in the 

    25/29.4. And God caused mists to rise up from the waters, and spread over the earth, and rain upon it. And he caused trees and herbs to grow up out of the ground; everything that is pleasant for the sight and good for food. Thus out of the ground the Lord God caused man to come forth, being of the earth, of the land of Eden (Spe-a).

same story, right.. the mists and rain are the "se’mu" and out of (the ground), the "Lord God" (later after man new good and evil, osiris divided himself into the lord of the earth and god of the air) caused man to come forth...in this later version the "tree" is now outside of adam:

    25/29.6. And man prospered on the earth for a long season; and he was naked and not ashamed. And God planted the tree of knowledge in the land of Eden, and he said to man: I have planted this tree; do not partake of it, for it pertains to life and death.
    [...]
    25/29.9. [...] except for the tree of life, which is of both good and evil, for in the day you eat of it you shall surely die.
    25/29.10. But because of the serpent of the woman, she listened to him, and he said to the woman: I say to you, in the day you eat of the tree of knowledge you shall have your eyes opened, and shall become like a Goddess, creating offspring.
    > 25/29.11. And the woman was more easily persuaded than man, for she had confidence in the serpent; and they partook of the fruit of the tree of knowledge; and, in truth, their eyes were opened, and they saw their nakedness.
    [...]
    25/29.14. The Lord God said: Woman, what have you done? And the woman answered, saying: The serpent beguiled me. And the Lord God said to the serpent: Because you have done this, you are accursed, and you shall not rise up from the earth, but return to dust from which you came.
    25/29.15. The Lord God said to the woman: Because you have conceived, you shall have great sorrow; in sorrow bring forth children; your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you. And I will put enmity between the serpent and your offspring; and the flesh shall call one way, which is to earth, but the soul of man shall call to me, the Lord God. And though the serpent bites, yet man shall bruise him, and subdue him.

you can see the number of comments there are trying to rectify the story with the previous version, but there are a few things that stand out:

1. the "serpent *of* the woman"
2. the serpent "shall not *rise up* from the earth"
3. "Lord God" said to the woman, "because you *conceived*"

we can then make an educated guess that the serpent is something inside of or a part of the woman. the serpent rises up from the earth (aka kundalini), and the result of this process of eating of the fruit that the serpent (kundalini) tempted the woman with, she *conceived* something.

he then drove them out of the garden of eden and placed an angel (cheribum) there to ensure that they never could return (a sort of guardian angel). so, it appears that these angels in the first account of which "man" is their progeny, become the guardian angels that prevent man from ever returning back to eden.

> Eden, Aden, Haden, Ah-den, Jeden, are of the same meaning in the Vedic, Phoenician and Chinese languages, and are from the Panic word Spe-a, or, rather, S’pe-a; i.e., a *heavenly place on earth*. –Ed.

so what it's saying is that angels have been placed to ensure that man never gets to return back to that blissful place of heaven on earth.

I believe that this devachan-on-earth state of mind can be heavan on earth, but it does not mean such a thing. the "heaven" (eden) part is likely not speaking of only the state of conditions, but instead of  rapid manifestation of corporeal (seen) realities -- and so therefore does not necessarily ensure everything is "good", as "evil" can also rapidly manifest into corporeal realities.

---

long sidebar there. what I think is happening is that the translators of these texts can be influenced just like anyone else can. it's been my own experience with "my inventions", "dividing the path", the sirian guide, and probably a few others, that I remember a different version of the text that I read in the past, but the text shown to me is different.

the way that time "travel" works is you tune into another location and either move their "physically" or just influence things at a distance with thoughts -- but you're doing it now, so now can't really change a whole lot.

as such, whether someone is actually going back and putting diffrent ideas into tesla, the guy who wrote dtp, or whatever's head, to alter the *translation* of the concept which gets written down or they're doing it remotely by tuning into and sending signals back in time to affect the present, you can imagine that if I were to change the concepts recieved, I could dramatically alter massive texts and their interpretations.

> he who controls (pertception of) the past, controls (the trajectory into) the future

I do believe that these texts and any other channeling sort of thing can be dramatically steered away from some desired perception. this book feels heavily temporally influenced and edited, but like I said, it's impossible for them to get anything but the obvious stuff -- so concepts still shine though.

for ideas on a large-scale implementation of this influencing of events and things, see leapfrogging-time-pickles. I think that the "guardian angels" have been "gifted" (see UFOs part 7?) this leapfrogging-time-pickles technology.
