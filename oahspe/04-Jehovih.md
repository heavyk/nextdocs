# Book of Jehovih

***In which is revealed the three great worlds (realms), corpor, atmospherea, and etherea. As in all other Bibles it is revealed that this world was created, so in this Bible, Oahspe, it is revealed how the Creator created it. As other Bibles have proclaimed heavens for the spirits of the dead, behold, this Bible reveals where these heavens are, and the manner, glory and work that the spirits of the dead enjoy; and through which the wisdom, power, love and glory of the Almighty is magnified for the understanding of man.***

### CHAPTER 1 Jehovih

04/1.1. All was. All is. All ever shall be. The All spoke, and Motion was, and is, and ever shall be; and, being positive, was called He and Him. The All Motion was His speech.

04/1.2. He said, I Am! And He comprehended all things, the seen and the unseen. Nor is there anything in all the universe that is not part of Him.

04/1.3. He said, I am the soul of all; and all that is seen is part of My person and My body.

04/1.4. By virtue of My presence, all things are. By virtue of My presence, life is. By virtue of My presence, the living are brought forth into life. I am the Quickener, the Mover, the Creator, the Destroyer. I am First and Last.

04/1.5. I am two apparent entities, nevertheless I am only One. These entities are the Unseen, which is Potent, and the Seen, which is of itself Impotent, and called Corpor.

04/1.6. With these two entities, in likeness of Myself through them, I made all the living; for as the life is the potent part, so the corporeal part is the impotent part.

04/1.7. Chief over all that live on the earth I made Man; male and female I made them. And, so that man could distinguish Me, I commanded him to give Me a name; by virtue of My presence I commanded him. And man did not name Me after anything in heaven or on the earth. In obedience to My will he named Me after the sounds the wind utters, and he said, E—O—Ih! Which is now pronounced Jehovih, and is written thus: [^51]

### CHAPTER 2 Jehovih

04/2.1. Jehovih said: By virtue of My presence I created the seen and unseen worlds. And I commanded man to name them; and man called the seen worlds Corpor, and the unseen worlds Es; and the inhabitants of Corpor, man called corporeans. But the inhabitants of Es he sometimes called es’eans and sometimes spirits and sometimes angels.

04/2.2. Jehovih said: I created the earth, and fashioned it, and placed it in the firmament; and by My presence, brought man forth a living being. I gave him a corporeal body so that he could learn corporeal things; and I made death so that he could rise in the firmament and inherit My etherean worlds.

04/2.3. To es I gave dominion over corpor; with es I filled all place in the firmament (even within corpor). But corpor I made into earths, moons, stars and suns; beyond number I made them, and I caused them to float in the places I allotted to them.

04/2.4. Es I divided into two parts, and I commanded man to name them, and he called one etherea and the other atmospherea. These are the three kinds of worlds I created (corporeal, atmospherean, and etherean); but I gave different densities to atmospherean worlds, and different densities to the etherean worlds.[^52]

04/2.5. For the substance of My etherean worlds I created Ethe, the Most Rarefied.[^53] Out of ethe I made them. And I made ethe the subtlest of all created things, and gave it power and place, not only by itself, but also power to penetrate and exist within all things, even within the corporeal worlds. And to ethe I gave dominion over both atmospherea and corpor.

04/2.6. In the All Highest places I created the etherean worlds, and I made them of all shapes and sizes, similar to My corporeal worlds. But I made the etherean worlds inhabitable both within and without,[^54] with entrances and exits, in arches and curves, thousands of miles high and wide; and in colors, movable chasms and mountains in endless change and brilliancy; and over them I ruled (rule) with All Perfect mechanism. To them I gave motions, orbits and courses of their own; and I made them independent, and above all other worlds in potency and majesty.

04/2.7. Nor did I create one etherean world like another in size, density or in component parts, but every one differing from another, and with a glory matchless each in its own way.[^55]

04/2.8. I also created atmospherean worlds in the firmament, and gave them places, orbits and courses for themselves. But atmospherean worlds I created shapeless and without fixed form, for they are in the process of condensation or dissolution, being intermediate in condition between My etherean and My corporeal worlds. Of three degrees of density I created them, and I commanded man to name them, and one he called Ji’ay, and one A’ji and one Nebulae.

04/2.9. But all of them are composed of the same substances, being like the earth, but rarefied. Nor is there on the earth or in it, one thing, whether iron, lead, gold, water, oil, or stones, that is not also in My atmospherean worlds. As I have given light to the earth so have I given light to many of them; and all these I have commanded man to call comets. And he named them so.

04/2.10. And I also created atmospherea around My corporeal worlds; together I made them.[^56]

### CHAPTER 3 Jehovih

04/3.1. Thus spoke Jehovih; by the light of Kosmon He proclaimed these things among the nations of the earth.

04/3.2. Man looked upward in prayer, desiring to know the way of all created things, both on earth and in heaven. And Jehovih answered him, saying:

04/3.3. The whirlwind I made as a sign to man of the way of My created worlds. As you see the power of the whirlwind gathering up the dust of the earth, and driving it together, know that likewise I bring together the ji’ay, a’ji and nebulae in the firmament of heaven; by the power of the whirlwind I create the corporeal suns, moons and stars. And I commanded man to name the whirlwinds in the etherean firmament, and he named them according to their shape, calling them vortices and wark.

04/3.4. By the power of rotation, swift driving at the periphery, I condense the atmospherean worlds that float in the firmament; and these become My corporeal worlds. In the midst of the vortices I made them, and by the power of the vortices I turn them on their axes, and carry them in the orbits I allotted to them. Wider than to the moons of a planet I have created the vortices, and they carry the moons also.

04/3.5. Around some of My corporeal worlds I have given nebulous belts and rings, so that man could comprehend the rotation of My vortexan worlds.[^57]

04/3.6. For each and every corporeal world I created a vortex first, and by its rotation and from the places in the firmament where it traveled, I caused the vortex to conceive the corporeal world.[^58]

04/3.7. To make the sun I created a great vortex, and within this vortex and subject to it, I made the vortices of many of the corporeal worlds. The sun vortex I caused to rotate, and I gave it power to carry other vortices within it. According to their density and position, they are thus carried forth and around the sun.[^59]

04/3.8. Do not think, O man, that I created the sky a barren waste, and void of use. Even as man in the corporeal form is adapted to the corporeal earth, so is he in the spiritual form adapted to My etherean worlds. Three great estates I have bestowed on man: the corporeal, the atmospherean and the etherean.[^60]

### CHAPTER 4 Jehovih

04/4.1. Man perceived the general formation of the world, and he prayed that his eyes would be opened for a sign in heaven; and Jehovih answered him, saying:

04/4.2. The clouds in the air I bring into view suddenly; by different currents of wind I make the unseen visible and tangible to man’s senses. In the same way, I cause etherean currents to bring forth ji’ay, a’ji and nebulae, prior to making corporeal worlds.

04/4.3. In all of the universe I have made the unseen to rule over the seen. Let the formation of clouds stand in view of man on earth, so that he may bear witness to the way the unseen becomes seen.

04/4.4. Man perceived, and he prayed for a sign of duration, and Jehovih answered him, saying:

04/4.5. Note the tree which has sprung up out of the ground and fulfilled its time; it falls and rots, and returns to the earth. But the wind, which you do not see, never ceases to blow. So also[^61] is the comparative duration of all things. Do not think, O man, that corporeal things are annihilated because they disappear; for as a drop of water evaporates and rises in the air as unseen vapor, so do all corporeal things, even earth, stones, gold, silver and lead, become as nothing (loss of corporeality) in the firmament of heaven in course of time.[^62]

04/4.6. Things that man sees, I created with a beginning and an end; but the unseen I made of endless duration.

04/4.7. I made the corporeal man belonging to the seen; but the spiritual man I made as one within the unseen, and everlasting.

04/4.8. As the corporeal man perceives corporeal things, so does the spiritual man follow upward the evaporated corporeal entities of things. As corporeal things are tangible to corporeans, so are es things[^63] tangible to the spirits of the dead.

04/4.9. As I cause water to rise upward as vapor, and take a place in the air above, let it be a sign and testimony of other places (plateaus) in atmospherea where the spirits of the lower heaven dwell.[^64]

04/4.10. As I made a limit to the ascent of clouds, so I made a limit to the places of the different kinds of substances in atmospherea; the more subtle and potent to the rim, and the more dense and impotent nearer to the earth.

04/4.11. According to the condition of these different plateaus in atmospherea, whether they are near the earth or high above,[^65] so shall the spirit of man take its place in the first heaven;[^66] according to his diet, desires and behavior, so shall he dwell in spirit on the plateau to which he has adapted himself during his earth life.

04/4.12. For I made the power of attraction manifest[^67] in all things before man’s eyes so that he might not err; so that like would attract like, I made them.

04/4.13. Man sought to know the progress of things. Jehovih answered him, saying:

04/4.14. Open your eyes, O man! There is a time of childhood, a time of propagation, a time of old age, and a time of death to all men. It is likewise with all the corporeal worlds I have created:

04/4.15. First as vapor the vortex carries it forth, and as it condenses, its friction engenders heat, and it is molten, becoming as a globe of fire in heaven. Then it takes its place as a newly born world, and I set it in the orbit prepared for it.

04/4.16. In the next age I bring it into se’mu,[^68] for it is ripe for the bringing forth of living creatures; and I bestow the vegetable and animal kingdoms.

04/4.17. Next it enters ho’tu,[^69] for it is past the age of begetting,[^70] even as the living who are advanced in years. Next it enters a’du,[^71] and nothing can generate upon it. Then comes uz, and it is spirited away into unseen realms. Thus I create and dissipate planets, suns, moons and stars.

04/4.18. My examples are before all men. My witnesses are without number. I raise the tree up out of the ground; I give it a time to bring forth fruit, followed by a time of barrenness, then comes death and finally dissolution. I prepare the new field with rich soil, bringing forth; and the old field that is exhausted. And by My examples man shall weigh the progress and destiny of a whole world.

04/4.19. Let no man marvel because of the size of the mammoth and the ichthyosaurus,[^72] for there was a time for them as there is a time for the infusoria[^73] of this day.

04/4.20. I have given you a sign, O man, in the queen of the honeybee; because of the change of the cell, she comes forth a queen, even from the same kind of germ[^74] as the other bees. Be wise, therefore, and remember that the earth is not in the place of the firmament of old. Let this be a testimony to you of the growth, change and travail[^75] of the earth.

04/4.21. Nevertheless, O man, the seen and the unseen are only parts of My person; I am the Unity of the whole.

### CHAPTER 5 Jehovih

04/5.1. Man perceived the magnitude and glory of the corporeal worlds. He said, How shall I speak of Your great works, O Jehovih, and of Your wisdom and power? Shall I open my mouth before You? I look upon Your countless stars, suns and moons, spread out over the heavens! The millions of years You have rolled them on in the never‑ending firmament! Processions in and out, and round about,[^76] of mighty worlds! By Your breath going forth!

04/5.2. O You All Highest! How can I hide my insignificance! I cannot create the smallest thing alive! Nor change the color of a hair on my head.[^77] What am I, that You have seen me?

04/5.3. Tell me, O my Creator, where did life come from—this unseen within me that is conscious of being? Tell me how all the living came into life?

04/5.4. Jehovih heard the words of man, and He answered him saying: Let a sign be given to man so that he may comprehend se’mu. || And so Jehovih caused the jellyfish and the green scum of water to be permanently coming forth in all ages, so that man could understand the age of se’mu, when the earth and the shores by the water, and the waters also, were covered over with commingled atmosphere and corporeal substance. This substance was called se’mu, because by His presence, Jehovih quickened it into life; and in that way, He made all the living, both the vegetable and animal worlds. Not that se’mu is jellyfish or the green scum of water; for in this day the earth does not produce se’mu abundantly; nevertheless the jellyfish and the green scum of water are signs of that which was in that day of the earth.

04/5.5. Jehovih said: Because of My presence I quickened into life all that live, or ever have lived.

04/5.6. Because I am male and female, even in My likeness, I made them thus.[^78] Because I am the power to quicken into life, so, in likeness of Me, I made them with power to bring forth.[^79]

04/5.7. According to their respective places, I created the living; not in pairs only, but in hundreds of pairs and in thousands and millions of pairs.

04/5.8. According to their respective places and the light upon se’mu, so I quickened them in their color, adapted to their dwelling places.

04/5.9. Each and every living thing I created new upon the earth, of a kind each to itself; and not one living thing did I create out of another.

04/5.10. Let a sign be upon the earth, so that man in his darkness may not believe that one animal changes and becomes another.

04/5.11. || And so, Jehovih gave permission for different animals to bring forth a new living animal, which would be unlike either its mother or father, but He caused the new product to be barren.[^80] ||

04/5.12. Jehovih said: And this shall be testimony before all men that I created each and all the living, after their own kind only.[^81]

04/5.13. Such is My person and My spirit, being from everlasting to everlasting; and when I bring a new world into the time of se’mu, My presence quickens the substance into life; and according to the locality and the surroundings, I bring forth the different species; for they are flesh of My flesh and spirit of My spirit. To themselves I give themselves; nevertheless, they are all members of My Person.

04/5.14. As a testimony to man, behold the earth was once a globe of liquid fire! Nor was there any seed on it. But in due season I rained down se’mu on the earth; and by virtue of My presence I quickened into life all the living. Without seed I created the life that is in them.

### CHAPTER 6 Jehovih

04/6.1. When man comprehended the earth he looked upward; and Jehovih saw him and knew the desires of his soul. So Jehovih sent His son Uz, and Uz spoke, saying:

04/6.2. Hear me, O man; the mysteries of heaven and earth I will clear up before your judgment. You (the human race) are the highest of all creation, and come to the highest of all kingdoms;[^82] from Great Jehovih you shall learn wisdom, and none shall stop you.

04/6.3. Contemplate, O man, on the magnitude of your Father’s kingdoms and His places in the firmament on high. Unless I take you into the heavens above, you cannot comprehend its places.

04/6.4. Man then rose up in spirit, and ascended into the firmament, for his spirit had crystallized into separateness; and Uz and Es[^83] ascended with him, speaking in the voice of the Father. And man saw that each and everything in the firmament was orderly, and still each to itself located. Then Es spoke, saying:

04/6.5. Observe, O man! As a farmer sows corn in one place, wheat in another, and flax in yet another—everything in a separate place; even so does Jehovih store the ingredients of which worlds are made—everything in its place: the substance of the iron in one place, the substance of the stones in another, the substance of the vegetable kingdom in another, and likewise for the substance of the animal kingdom, and the oils and sand; for He has places in the firmament of heaven for all of them. These that you saw are the ji’ay, the a’ji, and the nebulae;[^84] and amid them, in places, there is se’mu also. Let no man say: Over there is hydrogen only, and over here, oxygen only. The divisions of the substances of His creations are not as man would make them. All the elements are to be found not only in places close by, but in distant places also.

04/6.6. When the Father drives forth His worlds in the heavens, they gather a sufficiency of all things. And when a corporeal world is yet new and young it is carried forth not by random, but purposely, in the regions suited to it.[^85] Accordingly, as there is a time for se’mu; and a time for falling nebulae to bury deep the forests and se’muan beds, to provide coal and manure for a time afterward; so is there a time when the earth passes a region in the firmament when sand and oil are rained upon it, then covered up, and gases bound and sealed for the coming generations of men.

04/6.7. And man said: I am ashamed in Your sight, O Jehovih! I looked upward and said: The sky is vacant! Then I said: It is true, the corporeal worlds are made of condensed nebulae; but I did not see the wisdom and glory of Your works. I locked You up in coincidences and happenings. Your unseen world has become seen; the unreal has become the real.

04/6.8. O if only I had been mindful of You! If only I had not put You far off, nor imagined laws and decrees. Teach me, O Jehovih! How was the beginning of man? How was it with the first of the living that You brought forth?

04/6.9. Jehovih said: Have I not declared Myself in the past; in My works have I not provided thousands of years in advance? As I have shown system in the corporeal worlds, know then, O man, that system prevails in the firmament.

04/6.10. To the tree I gave life; to man I gave life and spirit also. And the spirit I made was separate from the corporeal life.

04/6.11. Out of se’mu I made man, and man was only like a tree, but dwelling in ha’k (darkness); and I called him Asu.[^86]

04/6.12. I looked over the wide heavens that I had made, and I saw countless millions of spirits of the dead, who had lived and died on other corporeal worlds before the earth was made.

04/6.13. I spoke in the firmament, and My voice reached to the uttermost places. And there came in answer to the sounds of My voice, myriads[^87] of angels from the roadway in heaven, where the earth travels. I said to them, Behold! I have created a new world; come and enjoy it. Yes, you shall learn from it how it was with other worlds in ages past.

04/6.14. There alighted upon the new earth millions of angels from heaven; but many of them had never fulfilled a corporeal life, having died in infancy, and these angels did not comprehend procreation or corporeal life.

04/6.15. And I said, go and deliver Asu from darkness, for he shall also rise in spirit to inherit My etherean worlds.

04/6.16. And now the earth was in the latter days of se’mu,[^88] and the angels could readily take on corporeal bodies for themselves; by force of their wills, clothing themselves with flesh and bones out of the elements of the earth. By the side of the Asuans they took on corporeal forms.

04/6.17. And I said: Go forth and partake of[^89] all that is on the earth; but do not partake of the tree of life, lest in that labor you become procreators and as if dead to[^90] the heavens from which you came.

04/6.18. || But those who had never learned corporeal things, being imperfect in wisdom, did not understand Jehovih’s words, and they dwelt with the Asuans, and were tempted, and partook of the fruit of the tree of life; and lo and behold[^91] they saw their own nakedness. And there was born of the first race (Asu) a new race called man;[^92] and Jehovih took the earth out of the travail of se’mu and the angels gave up their corporeal bodies. ||

04/6.19. Jehovih said: Because you have raised up those who shall be joint heirs in heaven, you shall tread the earth with your feet, and walk by the sides of the new born, being guardian angels over them, for they are of your own flesh and kin.[^93]

04/6.20. The fruit of your seed I have quickened with My spirit, and man shall come forth with a birthright to My etherean worlds.

04/6.21. As I have quickened the seed of the first born, so will I quicken all seed to the end of the earth. And each and every man‑child and woman‑child born into life I will quicken with a new spirit, which shall proceed out of Me at the time of conception. Neither will I give to any spirit of the higher or lower heaven power to enter a womb, or a fetus of a womb, and be born again.[^94]

04/6.22. As the corporeal earth passes away, so shall the first race Asu pass away; but as I do not pass away, so shall the spirit of man not pass away.[^95]

### CHAPTER 7 Jehovih

04/7.1. Jehovih said: Let a sign be given to the inhabitants of the earth so that they may comprehend dan’ha[^96] in the firmament of heaven. For even as I bequeathed[^97] to the earth a time for creating the living, and a time for angels to come and partake of the first fruits of mortality and immortality, so shall man, at certain times and seasons, receive testimony from My hosts in heaven.

04/7.2. || And Jehovih caused the earth, and the family of the sun to travel in an orbit, the circuit of which requires of them four million seven hundred thousand years. And He placed in the line of the orbit, at distances of three thousand years, etherean lights, at which places, as the earth passes through, angels from the second heaven come into its corporeal presence. As ambassadors they come, in companies of hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands, and these are called the etherean hosts of the Most High.

04/7.3. They come not as single individuals; nor do they come for a single individual mortal.

04/7.4. And Jehovih gave this sign to man on earth; which is to say: In the beginning of the light of dan’ha, the spirits of the newly dead shall have power to take upon themselves the semblance[^98] of corporeal bodies, and appear and talk face to face with mortals. Every three thousand years Jehovih gave this sign on earth, so that those, who learned the powers and capacities of such familiar spirits, could bear testimony regarding the origin of man on earth.[^99] || Jehovih said: And when it shall come to pass in any of the times of dan’ha that these signs manifest, man shall know that the hosts of the Most High come soon after.[^100] Let him who will become wise, enumerate[^101] the great lights of My serpent,[^102] for in such times I set aside things that are old, and establish My chosen anew. ||

04/7.5. In the time of the earth, when man was brought forth from mortal to immortal life, the earth passed beyond se’mu. The angels of heaven remained with corporeal man, but not in the semblance of mortals, but as spirits; and by virtue of their presence, strove to make man wise and upright before Jehovih. Upon the earth the number of such angels was millions. To these angels Jehovih spoke:

04/7.6. Behold the work you have taken in hand! It was commanded to you all, to partake of all the fruits of the earth except of the fruit of the tree of life, which is of the knowledge of the earth and heaven, lest you lose your inheritance in etherea.

04/7.7. Behold, you now have sons and daughters on the earth; by your love to them you have become bound spirits of the lower heaven. Until you redeem them in wisdom and power even to the sixth generation, you shall not rise again and inherit My emancipated heavens.

04/7.8. To which end[^103] you shall be co‑workers with one another in system and order. In My name you shall become an organic body and known as the heaven of the earth, or lower heaven, which shall travel with the earth.

04/7.9. And I will allot to you a Chief, who is wise in experience in founding heavenly kingdoms; and he shall appoint from among you, officers, messengers, ashars, asaphs, and es’enaurs,[^104] and you shall be numbered[^105] and apportioned to your labor and places, like in My other lower heavens on other worlds.

04/7.10. He who is Chief shall be called God of this heaven and the earth, which are now bestowed[^106] to his making.[^107]

04/7.11. And God shall have a Council and throne within his heavenly city; and the place shall be called Hored, because it is the first kingdom of God in this firmament.

04/7.12. And God shall rule on his throne, for it is his; and his Council shall rule with him; in My name they shall have dominion over angels and mortals belonging to the earth.

04/7.13. And God shall appoint Chiefs under him who shall go down and dwell on the earth with mortals; and the labor of these Chiefs shall be with mortals for their resurrection. And these Chiefs shall be called Lords,[^108] for they are Gods of land, which is the lowest rank of My commissioned Gods.

04/7.14. And God and his Lords shall have dominion from two hundred years to a thousand or more years; but never more than three thousand years. According to the regions of dan (light) into which I bring the earth, so shall the terms be for the office of My Gods and My Lords.

04/7.15. And God and his Lords shall raise up officers to be their successors; these officers shall be appointed and crowned in My name by God and his Lords.

04/7.16. At the termination of the dominion of My God and his Lords, they shall in these, My bound heavens, gather together all those angels who have been prepared in wisdom and strength for resurrection to My etherean kingdoms. And these angels shall be called Brides and Bridegrooms to Jehovih, for they are Mine and in My service.[^109]

04/7.17. And in the time of dan I will send down ships from etherea to God, his Lords and the Brides and Bridegrooms; by My etherean Gods and Goddesses, these ships shall descend to these heavens to receive God, his Lords and the Brides and Bridegrooms, and carry them up to the exalted regions I have prepared for them.

04/7.18. All those who ascend shall be called a Harvest to Me, through My God and Lords. And the time of My Harvests shall be according to each dan, which is two hundred years, four hundred years, six hundred years, and five hundred years; and these shall be called My lesser cycles, because they are the times of the tables of prophecy which I give to My servants.

04/7.19. But at no other times, nor in any other way, shall My Harvests ascend to My emancipated worlds in etherea. For each and every dan’ha I have created seven dans, and to each dan given six generations of mortals. ||

04/7.20. The angels understood the commandments of Jehovih according to their knowledge in the etherean heavens; being heirs of other planets, and having died in infancy, and having matured in the es worlds; but they did not understand the Creator regarding the practice of the lower heavenly kingdoms. And for that reason their knowledge was incomplete.

04/7.21. Jehovih said: I do not condemn you because you have become joint procreators with the asuans; for you have done two services to Me; which are first to teach yourselves corporeal things, so that you can understand and sympathize with corporeans, and second, you have caused the earth to become peopled with those who are capable of immortality.

04/7.22. Observe now what shall happen on the earth: Those who are of your flesh and kin who cohabit together shall rise in wisdom and virtue; but those who cohabit with the asuans will bring forth heirs in the descending grade of life. The first shall bring forth heirs to everlasting life; but the second shall bring forth heirs that shall go out in darkness.[^110]

04/7.23. In the dominion of which matters your God and Lords will instruct you, so that you may, by inspiration and otherwise, learn to control the behavior of mortals to everlasting life. And so that these labors are not too severe upon you, I created the dans and dan’has in the firmament, at which times you can be relieved from the watch by other angels from other worlds coming to exchange with you.

04/7.24. This also I put upon you: That to rule over mortals to virtue, by your own wills governing them in all things, is contrary to My commandments. For what honor has any man if made to do a thing?

04/7.25. But you shall give My light to mortals, leaving them to choose. It is better for them to suffer some than to grow up in ignorance of the stings of disobedience.

04/7.26. Know that I make this a willing service on your part; because you have bound your affections on the earth, to your own kin, you willingly become guardian angels over mortals. Yet I did not make a separate law for you; as it is with you, so shall it be with the spirits of these mortals when they are born into the es world: They will also desire to become guardian angels over their mortal kin.

04/7.27. But these spirits, never having known My higher heavens, will be unsuitable for the office of ashars; they would only be the blind leading the blind.

04/7.28. To prevent which, God and the Lords shall provide these spirits in the first resurrection with places to dwell in; and with occupations and opportunities for education. For I do not desire them to remain bound to the earth, but to rise up and inherit My etherean kingdoms.

04/7.29. And in this also you shall be discreet in governing them, giving them the light of My heavens with some liberty to choose and to perfect themselves. Otherwise they would only be slaves in heaven. According to their weakness or strength, so shall you provide for these new spirits entering My es world.

04/7.30. Therefore those of you who are appointed by My God and My Lords as guardians over mortals shall be called Ashars, and you shall report to your respective Lords, according to the section of the earth where you may be. And ashars shall have many watches (work shifts).

04/7.31. And those of you who are appointed to receive the spirits of the dead into heaven shall be called Asaphs, and you shall report to your respective Lords and their kingdoms.

04/7.32. And the ashars shall make a record of every mortal as to the grade of his wisdom and good works; and when a mortal dies, and his spirit is delivered to the asaphs, the record shall be delivered with him; and the asaph, receiving, shall deliver this spirit, along with the record, into that place in these heavens which is adapted to his grade, where he shall be put to work and to school, according to the place of the resurrections which I created.[^111]

04/7.33. As you shall thus become organic in heaven, with rulers, teachers and physicians; and with capitals, cities and provinces; and with hospitals, nurseries, schools and factories, so shall you also ultimately inspire man on the earth to the same things.[^112]

04/7.34 And mortals who are raised up to dominion over mortals shall be called kings and emperors. As My Gods and My Lords are called My Sons, so shall kings and emperors be called sons of God; through him they shall be raised up to their places, and given dominion for My glory.

### CHAPTER 8 Jehovih

04/8.1. Jehovih said: God shall cause a record to be kept in heaven, of his dominions and those of his Lords. And he and they shall enjoin[^113] it upon their successors forever to keep a like record.

04/8.2. And in the times of My harvest a copy of these records shall be taken up to My etherean kingdoms and filed with My Orian Chiefs and Archangels[^114] in the roadway of the travel of the great serpent,[^115] for their deliberations regarding the progress and management of the inhabitants of the earth and her heavens.

04/8.3. Do not think, O angels, that the resurrection of your heirs and their descendants who come up out of the earth is an easy matter, and of steady progress devoid of mishaps and woeful darkness.

04/8.4. The angels under you shall become at times rebellious and defiant; disregarding your laws and decrees; and they shall desert your heavenly places and go down to the earth in millions and hundreds of millions. And they shall drive away the ashars, and then assume guardianship over mortals. But they shall develop no righteousness under the sun; and they will inspire mortals to war and destruction. And these angels will themselves take to war and evil throughout the place of your heavens.

04/8.5. With the foul gases of atmospherea they shall make weapons of war and places of torment. With these elements they shall make suffocating hells in order to cast one another into chaos.

04/8.6. And mortals slain in war shall be born in spirit into chaos on the battlefields; and entering the es world in chaos, they shall not know that they are dead (as to earth life), but shall still keep fighting right and left.

04/8.7. And enemy shall take enemy in these heavens, and cast them into the places of torment, which they shall have built, and they shall not know peace or wisdom.

04/8.8. And the work of your heavens shall become as nothing. You shall go about delivering hells and the spirits in chaos. And your labor shall become exhausting; truly you shall cry out because you came and peopled the earth.

04/8.9. For I have also created this possibility for My creations, so that both angels and mortals shall learn to know the elements of the heavens and the earth, and to know the trials of love and misfortune.

04/8.10. Nor have I made wisdom possible to any man or angel who does not know My elements, and the extremes of evil and good which I created.

04/8.11. But in the times of great darkness, which shall come upon earth and these heavens, I will bring the earth into dan’ha; and My ethereans shall come in My name and deliver them.

04/8.12. And again for another cycle they shall be left with the lessons given to them; but they shall fall again in course of time. But again I will deliver them; through My Gods and Goddesses I will cause them to comprehend the magnitude of My creations.

04/8.13. As you travel from heaven to heaven (via ships) in this atmospherea, so shall you also inspire mortals to build corporeal ships, and sail across the oceans, so that the inhabitants of different divisions of the earth may become known to one another.

04/8.14. And when the inhabitation of the earth shall have been completed and the nations shall have established civil communion around from east to west, in that same time I will bring the earth into the Kosmon era, and My angel ambassadors, Gods and Goddesses, shall render up the records of these heavenly kingdoms.[^116]

04/8.15. Through them I will reveal to mortals the creation of My worlds, and the history and dominion of My Gods and Lords on the earth, even from this day down to the time of Kosmon. ||

04/8.16. And Jehovih caused the angels of atmospherea to assemble together and organize the first kingdom of the heaven of the earth. And the place was called Hored, because it was the place of the first organic abiding place for the first God of this world.

04/8.17. And Hored was situated over and above the mountains of Aotan in Ughoqui, east of Ul, of that country afterward called the continent of Pan.[^117] ||

04/8.18. Thus ends the inorganic habitation of the earth and her atmospherea.
