04/8.4. The angels under you shall become at times rebellious and defiant; disregarding your laws and decrees; and they shall desert your heavenly places and go down to the earth in millions and hundreds of millions. And they shall drive away the ashars, and then assume guardianship over mortals. But they shall develop no righteousness under the sun; and they will inspire mortals to war and destruction. And these angels will themselves take to war and evil throughout the place of your heavens.

jehova is predicting that the angels will become problematic

04/6.18. || But those who had never learned corporeal things, being imperfect in wisdom, did not understand Jehovih’s words, and they dwelt with the Asuans, and were tempted, and partook of the fruit of the tree of life; and lo and behold[^91] they saw their own nakedness. And there was born of the first race (Asu) a new race called man;[^92] and Jehovih took the earth out of the travail of se’mu and the angels gave up their corporeal bodies. ||

4 corners (of the earth), creation of the earth, chapter 6 (about man), verse 18 (6+6+6), the number of man -- is the verse talking about angels (ie. INFECTED ONES) procreating with and becoming man.

weird coincidence.

25/48.13. Rowtsag’s son, Hi‑ram, succeeded him; and Thammas, his son, succeeded Hi‑ram. Thammas was a seer and prophet, and could see the Gods and talk understandingly with them. Thammas was succeeded by his daughter, Hannah; and she was succeeded by Hojax, who was the builder of the Temple of Osiris, commonly called the Great Pyramid.

25/49.15. These were the instruments used by the king and his workmen: the gau, the length, the square, the compass, and the plumb and line. Nor were there any other instruments of measure or observation used in the entire building of the temple. And as to the measure called a length, it was the average length of a man, after measuring one thousand men. This length was divided into twelve parts, and these parts again into twelve parts, and so on.

69" (the average height of man) * 1000 / 144 = units of 39.930' (nearly 40 feet). I've often wondered the whole emphasis on 40. perhaps it's because it captures the first 3 prime numbers: 2^3 * 5.

5 (and 6) are also interesting because 5 is the only prime which is the sum of the first two primes (cause odd + odd = even, and 2 is the only even prime). also if you add (2+3)+(2*3) you get 11, (and I don't know if any other primes do that).

Pan: Original name of the earth, from Ah; as I see what I see; and, only what I see, is (exists). Also the name of a continent in the Pacific Ocean, submerged about 25,000 years ago. See Aph 10/, the flood.

only what is seen, exists -- as opposed to only what can be measured, is knowledge?:

Osire, Osiris: Philosophy of measurement. One who maintains that only what can be measured or weighed is real knowledge. The sun is the largest, therefore, the Sun is the Almightiest. Also a God; see Book of Osiris (18/). There was also a false God Osiris of later date who inspired the building of pyramids. [see 25/49.8-20]

05/16.17. And on the third day, ninety million angels assembled in Moeb (place of Parliment) and Hored (platau with Kingdom of God), to witness the descending and ascending of Jehovih’s chosen.

that's some pretty serious recognition. it reminds me of the one tick episode where it takes them (the guys that look like arthur) months to go through all of the ceremony in order to destroy the earth with a black hole -- or a business meeting with so many chosen ones to thank.
