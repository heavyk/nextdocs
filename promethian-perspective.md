# promethian perspective

I don't fully understand the promethian perspective in the context of "law of attraction" (LOA), so I thought I'd like to try and start to think about making these concepts feel more compatible.

### 2022-11-11 11:25 - desire from a promethian perspective

first of all, there are layers to looking at the concept of "law of attraction" -- which is that like attracts. this is also the summary of the idea that I have for gravity and how our atoms are constructed, but the essential idea is that you can imagine the ebb and flow of something when in sync double their magnitudes and in opposite phase cancel out each other's magnitude. super simple stuff, so when two things are going the same direction their (something I don't have a name for -- potential) is added, but if they're going in opposite directions, then then their (potetial?) is subtracted.

now, the problem is that LOA means a lot more than just that to a lot of people invoking consciousness in the form of source or inner beings. once you start mixing a simple arithmetic operation with consciousness, then you have to begin to wonder if it's yourself that's doing it all? am I the thing that I labeled previously as source or my inner being? it's certainly a difficult thing to consider. psychedellics help. however skipping over the mountains of evidence that cosciousness is fundamental, it's important to begin to realise that there is some part of yourself out there that really does have your back. others have labeled this your guardian angel or whatever -- and all those *could* be there, because you could have attracted them, but it's *at least* you. some part of everyone deeply loves themself and has their utmost well-being in consideration.

this is true from a maths-LOA perspective in that you have a bunch of similarly vibrating things that are attracting more similarly vibrating things. it's kinda like a black hole. it desires more things of its similar vibration. yourself is the same way. there is a very strongly vibrating portion of everyone that is attracting very strongly things of similar vibrations. these vibrations are at a much higher frequency than physical matter, so pretty amazing that our brain has the capacity of picking up on very faint shadows of such high frequency pulsations.

---

now, from a promethian perspective, we must understand heritage and the desire that it brings. every person has extremely similar DNA to their parents and siblings. these are all similarly vibrating things, and so therefore their collective desire is of a similar vibration (usually).

an entire culture is a bunch of very similarly vibrating things, so collectively their vibration should continue to grow indefinitely. left unhindered, it would; however, there are natural and unnatural destructive forces that ultimately are able to halt something that would continue to attract, expand, and grow indefinitely. contemplating this, one comes to the conclusion that all things are actually destroyed by theirselves.

we are our own worst enemies -- but there *is* always that one really high frequency part of every organisational/vibrational structure, and so the goal of a culture is to be able to instantiate this promethian spirit into their culture, so that the culture grows and continues on its heritage.

### 2022-11-11 12:06 - I should also add (about the high frequency stuff we call source)

it seems logical to me that every interaction of two vibrating things produces higher frequency harmonics. you can imagine there are a plethora of really high frequencies because of all of the interactions.

it also seems logical to me that at the subatomic level (that is, frequencies higher that the carrier frequency for the atom), would, in an environment of non-resistance, would begin to construct all sorts of things.

every person alive definitely has resonant frequencies at much higher rates than the subatomic, and there in the subatomic, resistance is so negligible, that you can imagine it as that pure desire. I want more things that vibrate similar to me. I am a clump of matter. we stick to our kind and others that we're vibrationally compatible with.

there are an ever expanding infinite set of higher harmonics to understand, and the processs of making sense of even higher frequencies, this subatomic "source" turns those desire (all the things that didn't work out -- these high frequencies being the result of frequential interactions -- so, all the stuff that didn't work out).

this is what we do as a race, a culture, a person, an animal or whatever; but, think like a newborn: we intend to *make sense* of more higher and higher frequency interactionss. this is everyone's base desire. this is the "source" of everything.

---

you know, what I love about it is that it has a conceptual interface to it, and so you could imagine this as the repository of the knowledge of all things. there are no restrictions. anything that you want is yours to feel. you attract it, and so it's yours. everything that you want is for the ability to feel like that. figure it out.

### 2022-12-01 11:26 - epimetheus is important too

I wanted to talk about the importance of afterthought, because, like mcluhan said, we're driving forward into the future looking into the rear-view-mirror. I have a funny image that I conjure in my mind from this visual, and imagine a guy driving his car forward looking backward into a giant mirror that's facing forward, the mirror is so big, he can't even see out the back window, but it allows him to see pretty good out the front window.

the way that we see our past, the conclusions that we give to ourselves, others, and to establishments determine our future. think a moment if I said, "that business isn't going anywhere". for me it's a conclusion, an afterthought on having seen the state of their business, and so this small afterthought has a large effect on the future.


### 2022-12-04 15:22 - balancing the fractal

look at one frequency impacting with another frequency. in astral, this appears as time, from the 4th/source perspective all things are percveived without resistance, and from the 2nd perspective they are perceived as the improvements/changes over time.

so, imagine one wave impacting another and because they have diameters (like a galaxy), the temoral aspect is difficult to predict because it's unknown how other orbits will be impacted by the impact. that perspective cannot be seen from the 3rd ray perspective. the 2nd ray perceives this perspective easily as a sort of tidal wave or sonic boom of new concepts that creates a new thing. the new thing is a resulting 4th ray environment where those things can exist. this is obvious to a 2nd ray, so the 3rd ray perspective is often neglected. this is the afterthought/enki perspective.

all things must be balanced, and a medium of stability needs to be created. this is a structure that works in a certain frequency spectrum. we know that the frequency will change (the 2nd ray perspective), but from our vantage point, until it can be known what exactly the specifications are, there's no point thinking about. stability in our own is primary concern.

the thing that the 3rd ray simply cannot be bothered to worry about anything other than what works. some of them are able to be convinced to try out new things that works, but this is the general industry of what they know "works". they are right about it too, because they too inherited this from the "gods". enki knew what worked (the system of proportions) and made everything work inside of those proportions, perfectly. it was paradise, but eventually that frequency changes (2nd ray) because those frequencies impact others and make more -- an impossibilty to understand from and balanced structured perception that works properly within a *frequency domain* -- which is important because they more than anyone doesn't want the frequency to change. they *must* hold it constant, for the sustain of life.

you can imagine how awful of a disaster it was to find out that earth will now run at a different frequency. life had to figure out how to survive in an environment not well suited to create the vibrations they were designed for. the quest for the conditions which can create those sacred frequencies we were designed for, created and attracted in all of the greedy ones. these wanted to hold on to and keep those sacred conditions for theirselves to have an edge on us. enki created a race of slaves, trying his hardest to create a society built up of our imaginal conditions.

a society built on imaginal conditions is one of slavery, because one has to imagine that those conditions are in some way justified or acceptable so they can be lived. in the end, it was the guilt that was put on the inhabitants of these lofty cultures of imaginal conditions eventually contributed to the collapse and reversal of roles. it's possible that by feeling guilty, we imagined our own destructor (I haven't really thought about it) -- as if we were secretly rooting for the underdogs. interesting rabbit trail.

the promethian perspective is ALL of the epimethian perspective, but the added condition of seeing the tidalwave of the waves producing waves, all in the direction of desire.

### balancing the fractal -- everything's detail isn't important so long as it matches/balances the fractal
