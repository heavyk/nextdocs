# promethian perspective

I don't fully understand the promethian perspective in the context of "law of attraction" (LOA), so I thought I'd like to try and start to think about making these concepts feel more compatible.

### 2022-11-11 11:25 - desire from a promethian perspective

first of all, there are layers to looking at the concept of "law of attraction" -- which is that like attracts. this is also the summary of the idea that I have for gravity and how our atoms are constructed, but the essential idea is that you can imagine the ebb and flow of something when in sync double their magnitudes and in opposite phase cancel out each other's magnitude. super simple stuff, so when two things are going the same direction their (something I don't have a name for -- potential) is added, but if they're going in opposite directions, then then their (potetial?) is subtracted.

now, the problem is that LOA means a lot more than just that to a lot of people invoking consciousness in the form of source or inner beings. once you start mixing a simple arithmetic operation with consciousness, then you have to begin to wonder if it's yourself that's doing it all? am I the thing that I labeled previously as source or my inner being? it's certainly a difficult thing to consider. psychedellics help. however skipping over the mountains of evidence that cosciousness is fundamental, it's important to begin to realise that there is some part of yourself out there that really does have your back. others have labeled this your guardian angel or whatever -- and all those *could* be there, because you could have attracted them, but it's *at least* you. some part of everyone deeply loves themself and has their utmost well-being in consideration.

this is true from a maths-LOA perspective in that you have a bunch of similarly vibrating things that are attracting more similarly vibrating things. it's kinda like a black hole. it desires more things of its similar vibration. yourself is the same way. there is a very strongly vibrating portion of everyone that is attracting very strongly things of similar vibrations. these vibrations are at a much higher frequency than physical matter, so pretty amazing that our brain has the capacity of picking up on very faint shadows of such high frequency pulsations.

---

now, from a promethian perspective, we must understand heritage and the desire that it brings. every person has extremely similar DNA to their parents and siblings. these are all similarly vibrating things, and so therefore their collective desire is of a similar vibration (usually).

an entire culture is a bunch of very similarly vibrating things, so collectively their vibration should continue to grow indefinitely. left unhindered, it would; however, there are natural and unnatural destructive forces that ultimately are able to halt something that would continue to attract, expand, and grow indefinitely. contemplating this, one comes to the conclusion that all things are actually destroyed by theirselves.

we are our own worst enemies -- but there *is* always that one really high frequency part of every organisational/vibrational structure, and so the goal of a culture is to be able to instantiate this promethian spirit into their culture, so that the culture grows and continues on its heritage.

### 2022-11-11 12:06 - I should also add (about the high frequency stuff we call source)

it seems logical to me that every interaction of two vibrating things produces higher frequency harmonics. you can imagine there are a plethora of really high frequencies because of all of the interactions.

it also seems logical to me that at the subatomic level (that is, frequencies higher that the carrier frequency for the atom), would, in an environment of non-resistance, would begin to construct all sorts of things.

every person alive definitely has resonant frequencies at much higher rates than the subatomic, and there in the subatomic, resistance is so negligible, that you can imagine it as that pure desire. I want more things that vibrate similar to me. I am a clump of matter. we stick to our kind and others that we're vibrationally compatible with.

there are an ever expanding infinite set of higher harmonics to understand, and the processs of making sense of even higher frequencies, this subatomic "source" turns those desire (all the things that didn't work out -- these high frequencies being the result of frequential interactions -- so, all the stuff that didn't work out).

this is what we do as a race, a culture, a person, an animal or whatever; but, think like a newborn: we intend to *make sense* of more higher and higher frequency interactionss. this is everyone's base desire. this is the "source" of everything.

---

you know, what I love about it is that it has a conceptual interface to it, and so you could imagine this as the repository of the knowledge of all things. there are no restrictions. anything that you want is yours to feel. you attract it, and so it's yours. everything that you want is for the ability to feel like that. figure it out.

### 2022-12-01 11:26 - epimetheus is important too

I wanted to talk about the importance of afterthought, because, like mcluhan said, we're driving forward into the future looking into the rear-view-mirror. I have a funny image that I conjure in my mind from this visual, and imagine a guy driving his car forward looking backward into a giant mirror that's facing forward, the mirror is so big, he can't even see out the back window, but it allows him to see pretty good out the front window.

the way that we see our past, the conclusions that we give to ourselves, others, and to establishments determine our future. think a moment if I said, "that business isn't going anywhere". for me it's a conclusion, an afterthought on having seen the state of their business, and so this small afterthought has a large effect on the future.

look at one frequency impacting with another frequency. in astral, this appears as time, from the 4th/source perspective all things are percveived without resistance, and from the 2nd perspective they are perceived as the improvements/changes over time.

so, imagine one wave impacting another and because they have diameters (like a galaxy), the temoral aspect is difficult to predict because it's unknown how other orbits will be impacted by the impact. that perspective cannot be seen from the 3rd ray perspective. the 2nd ray perceives this perspective easily as a sort of tidal wave or sonic boom of new concepts that creates a new thing. the new thing is a resulting 4th ray environment where those things can exist. this is obvious to a 2nd ray, so the 3rd ray perspective is often neglected. this is the afterthought/enki perspective.

all things must be balanced, and a medium of stability needs to be created. this is a structure that works in a certain frequency spectrum. we know that the frequency will change (the 2nd ray perspective), but from our vantage point, until it can be known what exactly the specifications are, there's no point thinking about. stability in our own is primary concern.

the thing that the 3rd ray simply cannot be bothered to worry about anything other than what works. some of them are able to be convinced to try out new things that works, but this is the general industry of what they know "works". they are right about it too, because they too inherited this from the "gods". enki knew what worked (the system of proportions) and made everything work inside of those proportions, perfectly. it was paradise, but eventually that frequency changes (2nd ray) because those frequencies impact others and make more -- an impossibilty to understand from and balanced structured perception that works properly within a *frequency domain* -- which is important because they more than anyone doesn't want the frequency to change. they *must* hold it constant, for the sustain of life.

you can imagine how awful of a disaster it was to find out that earth will now run at a different frequency. life had to figure out how to survive in an environment not well suited to create the vibrations they were designed for. the quest for the conditions which can create those sacred frequencies we were designed for, created and attracted in all of the greedy ones. these wanted to hold on to and keep those sacred conditions for theirselves to have an edge on us. enki created a race of slaves, trying his hardest to create a society built up of our imaginal conditions.

a society built on imaginal conditions is one of slavery, because one has to imagine that those conditions are in some way justified or acceptable so they can be lived. in the end, it was the guilt that was put on the inhabitants of these lofty cultures of imaginal conditions eventually contributed to the collapse and reversal of roles. it's possible that by feeling guilty, we imagined our own destructor (I haven't really thought about it) -- as if we were secretly rooting for the underdogs. interesting rabbit trail.

the promethian perspective is ALL of the epimethian perspective, but the added condition of seeing the tidalwave of the waves producing waves, all in the direction of desire.

this perspective has a tangible interface, like the 4th ray has the living blackness. I don't know what it is because I've never experienced it thus far, but I'll know it when I see it. it's always been there, but I just didn't see it *that* way before.

### 2022-12-04 16:41 - I'm basically the first to perceive the promethian perspective.

I got it the "wrong" way so, we're creating a demiurge. many others will also get the promethian perspective as well, as I believe it'll spread about as rapidly, but a bit delayed from the epimethian perspective. it'll be like a virus. get in while it's hot. it's cool inside.

### 2022-12-04 18:22 - opposition to the promethian perspective

will occur, kind of like how one tries to hold back the orgasm. I don't know yet, but I think it's done perceptually.

### 2022-12-04 18:44 - 1st ray stars

one of the things that I had such a difficult time identifying was the earth. the earth is a 1st ray female, but because of the martian overlords' crisis of their environment, they moved to earth and esttablished a vibrational grid here similar to that of mars.

in the beginning, the earth was formless and void. she appeared to them as the object of their desire, which was a planet similar to mars in every way, but it needed a vibrational layer to be martian compatible. this is maintained by the megalithic arthiecture that connects us to mars and the moon (potentially other places as well), so we're a sort of multi-layered facade on top of a 1st ray female.

one of the things that I saw is that these 1st ray stars are going to be different than the common stars in our galaxy of 2nd ray's, instead she is a 1st ray. this is quite impprtant to pay attention to because now all of the rays of perception will flow down in odd numbered layers (1,3,5?,7), instead of even numbers like now (2,4,6,7?). this is a complete shift in perception for those that incarnate into planets in a 1st ray star system. I'm probably going. it's going to be REALLY PHYSICAL on those planets. a jolly good time, I'm sure. I'm going to be one of those demiurges on the inner stars that is an overlord to the a population group in the large mass of land in the inner-galaxy. we'll stone age them for a very long time, having to figure out a way to deal with all of the tricks. this inevitably happens when a bunch of ambitious people team up. this is ultimately what drives technology. technology wins; marketing teams are the prophets and sales people the gatekeepers.

these 1st ray stars are these females that are just real problems for those that are trying to put them into a structure. this is an alternative to the 2nd ray perspective, which perhaps I'll want to talk about in another log.

the important thing to know any more about this concept is that he promethian perspective enables this. the promethian perspective often (ironically) overlooks his afterthought part of himself, often looking only in the imaginal part of what he thinks is desire. he thinks this is forethought, but when they deny the manifestation of the imaginal into the physical, they're manifesting an egregore of that specification to begin to appear in thier perception to teach them what the concept really means (not the imaginal 6th, but what is real forethought -- perceiving the wave of change and also the stable structure). for me at least, I often times don't see this stable structure because I'm such a lofty desireer -- which means I see problems all over the place. I used to be quite critical about them, but obviously there's only so much one can do about problems I have no control over. I get that they unbalance the system, but this earth isn't on a constant vibration anymore.

---

what I think will happen and to emerge out of this is actually a new thing which I think I defined the other night as constant novelty, rathar than constant contrast. the nice thing about constant novelty, is it allows contrast to be variable. there's no threat to any part of society if you have constant inflation in the form of novelty. a good 2% novelty inflation is a great stabiliser. if at some point we need to adjust the novelty inflation ratio, because soemone needs to print some oppsie cash, then it's possible to adjust the novelty inflation ratio to whatever is necessary. people be like, "woah dawg, slow down on the cool new stuff"
