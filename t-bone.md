yesterday, I made a comment that I disagreed with terence on a few subjects, and then briefly mentioned that I *don't* think the world is composed of words or language. I woke up this morning thinking about it (see below). then, while smoking this morning, I had an idea to watch that video above. I'm about 10m in now, and many things I've wanted to write about. I see a few things a lot different than terence and so I think I'll start with a better explanation of what I said yesterday, then start the video over and make a additional comments on that video.

the world is composed of concepts. we use words and language to describe those concepts. because of this, we think that the words are the world, but that's like saying I'm only atoms.

to illustrate this, imagine for a moment a story. a story is just words and sentences, so if I told you a story is only words and sentences, you would know there's quite a lot more to a story than just symbolic language. we use symbolic language to *describe* this hidden world that exists in the author's mind.

in this sense of words only being a description of this other world, I'm far more on board with jason's idea that these words serve kind of like access points -- sort of addresses to help you locate the world. these "authorised realities" are what authors do to allow their creation to live on, and for us, they have the benefit of creating reality for us.

the other day, I mentioned that I understood the role of legends and legendary people and that was because of the progression of desire. I need something (basic survival), to I want something (materialism), and then you realise that you are the thing you're looking for. the way you get there is through the concept of these legends. we idolise them in our minds saying, I want to be like them, and then after some time, you realise that you have become that legendary figure you wanted to meet, save you, love, whatever physical desire may appear, because on the inside you are signaling to yourself that you will like yourself if you're like this legendary character.

well, thank goodness we started out with zeus the storm god so that aspiring young children with a desire to also be legendary, grew up wanting to become a pouty serial rapist to also be legendary. these kinds of legends that we desired externally, and have subsequenty created them into our reality. they're like egregores of our own creation. they're created externally because we think of ourselves as incapable of being that legend. in that sense, words do *create* reality, however, which is quite different than words *being* reality.
