### 2022-11-30 12:05 - the shaman and the machine

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TWl7887LLY)

yesterday, I made a comment that I disagreed with terence on a few subjects, and then briefly mentioned that I *don't* think the world is composed of words or language. I woke up this morning thinking about it (see below). then, while smoking this morning, I had an idea to watch that video above. I'm about 10m in now, and many things I've wanted to write about. I see a few things a lot different than terence and so I think I'll start with a better explanation of what I said yesterday, then start the video over and make a additional comments on that video.

the world is composed of concepts. we use words and language to describe those concepts. because of this, we think that the words are the world, but that's like saying I'm only atoms.

to illustrate this, imagine for a moment a story. a story is just words and sentences, so if I told you a story is only words and sentences, you would know there's quite a lot more to a story than just symbolic language. we use symbolic language to *describe* this hidden world that exists in the author's mind.

in this sense of words only being a description of this other world, I'm far more on board with jason's idea that these words serve kind of like access points -- sort of addresses to help you locate the world. these "authorised realities" are what authors do to allow their creation to live on, and for us, they have the benefit of creating reality for us.

the other day, I mentioned that I understood the role of legends and legendary people and that was because of the progression of desire. I need something (basic survival), to I want something (materialism), and then you realise that you are the thing you're looking for. the way you get there is through the concept of these legends. we idolise them in our minds saying, I want to be like them, and then after some time, you realise that you have become that legendary figure you wanted to meet, save you, love, whatever physical desire may appear, because on the inside you are signaling to yourself that you will like yourself if you're like this legendary character.

well, thank goodness we started out with zeus the storm god so that aspiring young children with a desire to also be legendary, grew up wanting to become a pouty serial rapist to also be legendary. these kinds of legends that we desired externally, and have subsequenty created them into our reality. they're like egregores of our own creation. they're created externally because we think of ourselves as incapable of being that legend. in that sense, words do *create* reality, however, which is quite different than words *being* reality.

---

you know, there is some truth to words shrouding or covering over the conceptual reality. this was the major struggle that I had as a child because -- like terence said, I wanted to behave like a machine, but more importantly I wanted *others* to behave like a machine so that I could understand them. I wanted them to speak clearly with me. I wanted them to have the honesty that a programmer has with her computer. it's just plain language, because if it's not plain, the program is inorrect.

all data is assumed to be understood (through the view of the program). therefore, what kind of ended happening, is that I started to see myself from the perspective of the program. I thought that I could figure everything out -- and, you just have inputs and outputs -- so if I know the inputs and outputs, I know everything.

turns out that the inputs and outputs aren't units, but more like waves. they behave and interact with things that they resonate with, so to "get" (receive, understand) the real concept behind the shroud, it's all about signal reception. definitions are our own, which are the concept (in our perception), but then there is the *actual* concept behind that shroud of our own (or someone else's) definition.

so here's this weve based reality but I feel binary and unit-based in my thought, so I have to figure out what thing is a thing. I really like the "data structures" in the conceptual realm much more because anything similar (all derivataves) resonate with its parent concept and other concepts that compose it. every data structure links to every other data structure that it's similar to, which are all the ones that composed it; much easier memory alignment for me...

look at it as three parts. there is the female, and she transmits and receives on the frequency of her concept. she is the "actual" concept. then you have the "shroud", which are the two males. the ground is your definition of the concept, and the emitter is the culturally, narrated, handed down, or acquired in some way definition of the concept. the ground (your definition) is constantly taking the energy from the emitter (the narrators) and comparing with with the actual concept (the female) and making adjustments to it, trying to maintain that it feels good. the ground is basically finding a compatible interface between the female (the actual concept) and the emitter's (narrator) concepts. the ground (just like in electricity) uses the female's (sun's) energy to power the created reality of the "authors" (jeortau/prometheus, zeus/ra, mercury/thoth, mars/aries).

this concept works individually and also collectively. this is the importance of the progression of desire because we're passing the materialism phase now. it'll peak sometime in the future, and at the height of such an abundance reality, it'll be natural to realise that it's not the stuff outside, but the thing that goes between bodies that matters. *I* am/have the thing I was looking for another person. we become the legends we're looking for.

### 2022-11-30 13:05 - gradualism vs individualism

one of my main critisisms of terence (and it's most visible in his humour), is his obsession with individualism. what I mean is that everything needs be a unit. it has to have a defined boundary -- and it's only in the context of psychedellics that he allows himself to think like a gradualist.

in reality, both of these perspectives are valid and speak tremendously of its dualistic nature -- and so therefore it is the goal of both the human and the machine to see both of these perspectives.

like I said, it appears dual but it's much easier to understand when it's seen as three. I'll put it into church cathedral builder speak here. you have the father, which is the real concept (the one in 5d), then you have the son, which is the emitter (the one in 4d), then you have the lesser one or the fool (the one in 3d). the concept itself is gradual and so because of its ever changing nature, it's a contradiction or paradox to itself because itself is eternal. that concept will exist for eternity for as long as someone keeps accessing it.

then, out of this father, there are the two sons: one is the good son, and the father hands him all of the enjoyable tasks, and then the other son that has to deal with all of the problems. when thinking of something to do for his son, the first one always comes to mind. if he's not available, then he thinks of friends. it's only an afterthought where the father would remember the foolish son. the foolish son is the ground. it's your physical definitiion of reality and what those concepts mean. this is your body -- your physical mind/brain.

but then the valiant good son is always there to take all the fun away. he's a total attention whore and just wants to be the star of everyone's attention. he's a real charmer, you know. everyone loves him. that's your 4d reality there.

therefore, it's important to be able to see the individual reality, whether it's the fool or the son or some combination thereof -- but also to be able to see the gradualistic perspective.

on this subject I'm much more closely aligned with jason with his definition of "spectral" -- with the emphasis that this reality actually has a spectrum to it, and not *only* the individualist perspective.

#### 2022-11-30 13:25 - followup about the father analogy

I used the symbol of the father and his two sons, because I have demonstrated multiple times elsewhere that the "father" is anatau/ninhursag -- and she's a real con-artist. she's so many different people to so many different people. I think she could also shapeshift and/or appeared as the rendering of the person's concept of her -- as in, sexy if they like her or a real bitch if she's on their nerves. I think she often times appeared as male to people because that's how humans were built to perceive to perceive her kind of energy, as masculine.

she combines all of the energy of all of the things that could go wrong into a physical incarnation. she was a real troublemaker so she got labled masculine because women (normal non-psychotic ones) all behaved naturally as very nurturing and caring. we can thank her for our definition of what it is to be "female" or male. the men get that definition of being the summation of all the things going wrong. I actually believe it's encoded in our DNA -- another thing we inherited from the "gods".

therefore, since you all know the father is actually a woman, it's interesting to look at the same analogy of the "father" with two sons, but to also see it as a mother with two sons (see the difference in how it feels?) or a mother with two daughters -- or father with two daugthers. the way that we play out the archetypes of forethought, illusion, ideas, grandiosness, pomp, pride, passion, etc. in comparison to the daily grind is a common trope, therefore, imagine a "father" or a psychotic crazy woman (that appears as a man to most), as the source of these two "sons" (or daughters). the "father" is the "real" unchanging concept.

the father can be seen through the gradualist perspective, which is one of aromas, fine wine, and other gradualist forms of pleasure. or, the father can be seen from the individualistic perspective.

these are the egregores of our creation. don't expect zeus to change, because he is the unchanging concept manifest into reality. they won't ever change. the only thing that we have power over are the two sons. you are one part forethought and one part afterthought/regret and this is what composes/authors your reality. pay attention to see if you're seeing from the fool or from the sun/son's point of view.

perspective matters; and, even required, to see beyond two dimensions.

### 2022-12-01 14:48 - jeortau, enki and epimetheus

I wanted to talk now about a potentially controversial subject, which is the one of prometheus/jeortau/alalu -- the fire element.

it's my theory of what happened is that this guy, created a really awesome setup of very good conditions. he attracted a lot of entities from all around the galaxy. then, he self-sabotaged, and created an egregore to destroy himself and take over his empire, enlil.

what I believe was the bigger picture here is that prometheus' original setup was so awesome, it attracted a lot of those that like the good conditions. it also attracted the dreaded INFECTED ONES. they've installed themselves into the astral and rule us 3d types from "up on high" this is plato's cave so I'll just call them the archons from now on, even though INFECTED ONES is quite a bit more hilarious. so, then when prometheus' egregore, enlil destroys him, it takes all of those of us that have joined in cause the living was nice or in my case probably because I like the challenge. all of this came crashing to a halt and we were stuck in the astral ourselves almost like unmanifested egregoes.

eventually earth became a place for us to live (I'm using the 3rd person here cause it's better than 1st). we inhabit physical bodies, but ourselves are created from these definitions/concepts/actions that were used in the summoning process. many summons have been inentional, but most I believe have been unknowing of it and the archons have exploited our concept of others to contiually keep separation between us, else our consciousness would expand to the point where we join them in the astral.

the more energetic you and your rituals are, the "higher" they are up on the heierarchy. they get pretty high -- and it's a big measuring contenst of vision depth -- of which I far outclass them all. they're not even close. they can barely keep up with me, so they have to hold me out of their space. they don't really need to because I just keep expanding. I'm not like them in that once I get to a size, I say that's enough. I'm caught in a runaway feedback loop and I have no choice but to ride the wave. if I were to get connected, I would have access to all of their controls and stuff they use to control people, because I'm way far beyond the highest archon.

I believe that many of us jumped into this earth plane on purpose. I must presume that I did, knowing myself. you know it would just seem like something I can do... "archons that think they run the show? more dimensions? no sweat. of course I'll go, duh" -- something like that.

therefore... I must conclude that prometheus self-sabotaged by creating an own opposite egregore of himself. I know I have, and I think many others have as well. we're all our own worst enemy, and it's because we *forsee* these things coming. sometimes they're good, but the archons are always there to try and manipulate that foresight. in further conclusion, I must say that afterthought isn't something that the archons can really touch, so I say, don't really worry about forethought. instead, I take a conceptual approach that is *faaaarrrrr* superior to what they have in their super secret astral buddies club. which is why we have to take the fire back and say, "these are the concepts and how <they mean to me|look to me>. it's already reality enough for me, don't tell me how to define it"

my reality is much closer to how a baby first sees the world, as a bunch of ununderstood things that are being desired to be understood. it's an enjoyable experience to see things the way I want to see them. it's not your reality. it's mine. I'll see them how I want to see them.

babies don't have the ability to formulate logical ideas and convey them in speech, so they cannot defend theirselves ideologically -- however, I have the ability to continue to believe what I want to beleive, so for me all of the concepts look new to me. this is because my mind has tons of DMT in it so it's making connections everywhere. I see connections everywhere so I'm constantly expanding because everything is teaching me about everything else. it's really good to take some time to reflect and have some afterthought on all of those connections being made, so I like to write these a lot.

if prometheus would have engaged in more afterthought, self-reflective writing, lyrics, dance, whatever, then he would have seen what he wanted to see, rather than his greatest fear becoming a reality by his creation being taken from him and destroyed without good reason (*la unbelief*). if he took time to think and give himself some afterthought, having "known" himself, he would have have summoned a different egregore of his own liking instead. things would have been different though -- a lot different, so it's good to get someone on the team that is OK making mistakes. let them do it. that was prometheus.

his counterpart in the triad is, enki/ptah/sanatau/epimetheus. as the ground, he represents our current definition of reality, so he took the fire concept of prometheus which is based on concept/emotion/inntuition (5th ray) and heart (4th ray), and made it available to work in the imaginal. get rid of the heart/fire stuff and confine the emotions to only work in the imagination, and this I believe was the downfall of atlantis.

the downfall of atlantis was enki's fault because he restricted the fire (emotions and heart) to be used only in the imagination. this caused a very visual group of people, that worked in the way of memory that steiner relates... however, because of the limitation imposed by enki, we gained the capacity for logic. the archons abused and it's brought us to now where we repeat the opposite thing where logic (3rd ray) has gotten so far out of hand (like the astral in atlantian times), that this next upgrade is in the form of memory and probabilities.

unfortunately, right now memory (and how we perceive the past) affects greatly how we perceive possibilities. as kids, we say "it'll never/always happen" because things wohk in those infinites. later we start to make more cases than just always or never and, finally where I'm at, it's more like a gradient of possibliites. to make a gradient understandable, I've broke it into 4 different qualities, that I've called el/la belief/unbelief. these are the aspcets that make up our perception. they are epimetheus. they are enki personified in our being.

when you understand enki's perspective, prometheus.

### 2023-01-08 04:44 - fire thoughts

and, another great joke: when you understand enki's perspective, prometheus.

### 2023-01-08 05:17 - what all of this is, is

is, a redirection of the timeline. we're approaching differently, but one of the main takeaways is that we should not try to make jumps and continue with as little acceleration as possible. the goal is not to get there as fast as possible but to think of this as an investment.

I assimilate thoughts much faster than most people, and I see everyone else as relative to me, so I'm a new medium and that mans that everyone can either accelerate or decellerate then accelerate, but the end result is acceleration for everyone.

this regime probably won't be lasting too long because I see other girls starting to "get" this stuff. because they're kinda a bit of a group consciousness, I think they'll become the new zero that everything else is relative to. then, maybe another faction. every new medium (faster than its parent medium) started, everyone else is already relatve to the new zero, so nobody gets lost. the stuff that's relative to the parent medium is that low temperature pressure wave of smoke on the top touching the cold air on the rising flame.

### 2023-01-08 13:42 - art of retrospective

you know how terence related this really complex story about his singularity event casing the world to split into two -- and he said it all came in an seeming instant (about 3-4m he said). I get them all the time and abraham said that esther gets them all the time.

there were reports that many people had dreams of 9-11 thing happening. as in, it was in people's psyches instantly and for some months and even many years sometimes. that's the bridge.

so I get the same thing of that all the time, and I guess you can call it the "art of retrospective" because I'm using memory-like features to tune into anything anywhere. it's just a basic faculty for me. what ends up happening too is that I can control it, but from time to time I get these flashes like terence too. the whole scene scenario comes in an instant, then I like to unveil it by rendering it into a really abstract part of reality that I can only describe as being like a computer. when I render it, it's something like imagination in that I can consciously manipulate what the environment and what I'm looking at -- same thing, but the image that I see is so fine (like much tinier than an atom), that it takes some skill to get used to perceiving.

so, for example, I'd like to relate how I saw the galaxy beginning to form. one way to look at my situation is that I'm the new atlas. I basically have the entire world running on my back, and it'll continue to increase cause these guys wouldn't know what to do otherwise. it's perfectly fine this is happening because my new theory is that my conceptual aquisition rate is directly linked to the x-ray output of the inner star. I also think the stare as got this kind of attraction and force field about it. I can see how in a very short bit, it'll make sense to move the stare outside of the planet, and just let her do her thing. that's like the new centre point of the galaxy. you know in other visions, I also saw this happening, and when it did, there was darkness and it took a bit for a new star to start forming on the inside. we'll leave behind a string of stars, like pearls on a necklace of stars (lol). brb coffee.

### 2023-01-08 15:16 - every human alive is going to be gods

I don't know exactly when this will or has happened, but to me it seems that people will both stop dying so much and also we'll gain the ability to move our consciousness from body to body. I'll live forever -- meaning, I'm sure that by the time my body is too feeble to continue on, we'll have technology to be able to consciously select the destination of your consciousness after your "transition". I'm sure we're going to be able to control it, so that means that scientifically speaking, we're going to live forever.

our eternal lifespan and also what I believe now the 2038 magical number is probably when stare is getting too strong, and so she'll be released out to become the centre of our galaxy. another star will start forming on the inside of the planet, but this time as a reflection of all of our desire and concepts. who knows how long we'll wait before releasing the next one -- probably going to be regulated by the sun, so in my estimation every 1024y.

I'm not 100% sure 2038 is right on the peak though, so I've postulated that it's actually 2048 and 2038 is the deadline to figure out how to live under such high energy conditionss. I think it's really easy as long as we have a conceptual basis for it -- which is why it's so nice that I've essentially become my own medium. as long as I exist, which is basically forever, you all exist. welcome to forever. we'll figure it out as we go.

there were many other ideas on different paths to take right now, but none of that makes no difference because all paths lead to this "destiny". we're destined to become a galaxy and it's entirely unavoiadable/inevitable; so get used to being a "god". if you think about it, we're the fallen-angels and the society and conceptual structure of our society and mentality (which is a reflection of me) is the new "jehovih" of this new galaxy.

I could see that this new medium that I'm creating here on earth is going to start expanding, and we'll add all planets and stars that we want to our system. we don't need to take everything in the galaxy right, as we'll be the second 3d galaxy in the universe; the first is the one we live in.

so, when we vibrate ourselves in harmony with the other stellar bodies that we want in our system (all others will be repelled), we have the choice to keep anything that we want. we can include it all, or exclude some bits. I even saw in one vision that we absorb the entire milky-way galaxy and all who want to remain in the milky-way can even be included in our own down the line. it's quite probably that other (non 3d) galaxies may even join us -- some lowering their frequency to get some physicality, and others artificially adding an interface to physical. it'll be kinda like the wild-west in here.

no matter if we're absorbing the milky-way or not, we're going to eventually separate ourselves from the parent medium of the milky-way and become our own. I figure all of the crap that we don't accept frequentially into our galaxy will go shooting off into the universal medium. no problem really, cause we're only either one or two 3d galaxies (I'm fairly certain), so we can either dual with the galaxy or be *the first!*. it's really up to us, and we'll decide on that many many (perhaps many thousands) down the line.

the thing that I was really having fun with last night were two conflicting concepts: first, that stare will have tremendous ouput, and so that solar wind will go racing out with the most physical stuff bunching up in front (like snow on a shovel) going out into the universal medium, and if there are other galaxies out there, placing a large mass object (like a small planet) that doesn't have resonance with us, will go shooting out at tremendous speeds, and if we're good at aiming, we can take pot shots at the milky-way. I find this idea absolutely hilarious and kinda wanna do it, so what we do, I think is to make a coucil or something to ensure that other stars in the galaxy aren't blasting things out at other 3d galaxies.

---

the other thing I was looking at is that there are infinite ways to get there, so check out this crazy idea. the humans that don't want to make the transition -- don't worry so much because what we can do is put them on a planet (or planets) and they'll have other planets and stuff with them, they'll grow up, and then we'll be their "gods". they'll grow up and figure out really amazing stuff. the cool thing is that anyone wanting to be a saviour can do that. imagine a race of humans in right about the technological capability of 2020 and they're just on an earth-like planet that's out there. jump into one of the bodies and do what I'm doing now and make your own galaxy. it provides self-recursion, which is a staple of something that expands infinitely.

### 2023-01-08 15:54 - the worst case scenario

the worst case scenario is that someone splits this timeline and continues on with this timeline put inside of a (destroyable) physical object -- and somehow that physical object gets destroyed, all of the stuff with the galaxy goes up in a puff of smoke (probably melted computer parts), then I'll have to start over again.
