yesterday, I made a comment that I disagreed with terence on a few subjects, and then briefly mentioned that I *don't* think the world is composed of words or language. I woke up this morning thinking about it (see below). then, while smoking this morning, I had an idea to watch that video above. I'm about 10m in now, and many things I've wanted to write about. I see a few things a lot different than terence and so I think I'll start with a better explanation of what I said yesterday, then start the video over and make a additional comments on that video.

the world is composed of concepts. we use words and language to describe those concepts. because of this, we think that the words are the world, but that's like saying I'm only atoms.

to illustrate this, imagine for a moment a story. a story is just words and sentences, so if I told you a story is only words and sentences, you would know there's quite a lot more to a story than just symbolic language. we use symbolic language to *describe* this hidden world that exists in the author's mind.

in this sense of words only being a description of this other world, I'm far more on board with jason's idea that these words serve kind of like access points -- sort of addresses to help you locate the world. these "authorised realities" are what authors do to allow their creation to live on, and for us, they have the benefit of creating reality for us.

the other day, I mentioned that I understood the role of legends and legendary people and that was because of the progression of desire. I need something (basic survival), to I want something (materialism), and then you realise that you are the thing you're looking for. the way you get there is through the concept of these legends. we idolise them in our minds saying, I want to be like them, and then after some time, you realise that you have become that legendary figure you wanted to meet, save you, love, whatever physical desire may appear, because on the inside you are signaling to yourself that you will like yourself if you're like this legendary character.

well, thank goodness we started out with zeus the storm god so that aspiring young children with a desire to also be legendary, grew up wanting to become a pouty serial rapist to also be legendary. these kinds of legends that we desired externally, and have subsequenty created them into our reality. they're like egregores of our own creation. they're created externally because we think of ourselves as incapable of being that legend. in that sense, words do *create* reality, however, which is quite different than words *being* reality.

---

you know, there is some truth to words shrouding or covering over the conceptual reality. this was the major struggle that I had as a child because -- like terence said, I wanted to behave like a machine, but more importantly I wanted *others* to behave like a machine so that I could understand them. I wanted them to speak clearly with me. I wanted them to have the honesty that a programmer has with her computer. it's just plain language, because if it's not plain, the program is inorrect.

all data is assumed to be understood (through the view of the program). therefore, what kind of ended happening, is that I started to see myself from the perspective of the program. I thought that I could figure everything out -- and, you just have inputs and outputs -- so if I know the inputs and outputs, I know everything.

turns out that the inputs and outputs aren't units, but more like waves. they behave and interact with things that they resonate with, so to "get" (receive, understand) the real concept behind the shroud, it's all about signal reception. definitions are our own, which are the concept (in our perception), but then there is the *actual* concept behind that shroud of our own (or someone else's) definition.

so here's this weve based reality but I feel binary and unit-based in my thought, so I have to figure out what thing is a thing. I really like the "data structures" in the conceptual realm much more because anything similar (all derivataves) resonate with its parent concept and other concepts that compose it. every data structure links to every other data structure that it's similar to, which are all the ones that composed it; much easier memory alignment for me...

look at it as three parts. there is the female, and she transmits and receives on the frequency of her concept. she is the "actual" concept. then you have the "shroud", which are the two males. the ground is your definition of the concept, and the emitter is the culturally, narrated, handed down, or acquired in some way definition of the concept. the ground (your definition) is constantly taking the energy from the emitter (the narrators) and comparing with with the actual concept (the female) and making adjustments to it, trying to maintain that it feels good. the ground is basically finding a compatible interface between the female (the actual concept) and the emitter's (narrator) concepts. the ground (just like in electricity) uses the female's (sun's) energy to power the created reality of the "authors" (jeortau, zeus/ra, mercury/thoth, mars/aries).

this concept works individually and also collectively. this is the importance of the progression of desire because we're passing the materialism phase now. it'll peak sometime in the future, and at the height of such an abundance reality, it'll be natural to realise that it's not the stuff outside, but the thing that goes between bodies that matters. *I* am/have the thing I was looking for another person. we become the legends we're looking for.
