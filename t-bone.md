### 2022-11-30 12:05 - the shaman and the machine

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TWl7887LLY)

yesterday, I made a comment that I disagreed with terence on a few subjects, and then briefly mentioned that I *don't* think the world is composed of words or language. I woke up this morning thinking about it (see below). then, while smoking this morning, I had an idea to watch that video above. I'm about 10m in now, and many things I've wanted to write about. I see a few things a lot different than terence and so I think I'll start with a better explanation of what I said yesterday, then start the video over and make a additional comments on that video.

the world is composed of concepts. we use words and language to describe those concepts. because of this, we think that the words are the world, but that's like saying I'm only atoms.

to illustrate this, imagine for a moment a story. a story is just words and sentences, so if I told you a story is only words and sentences, you would know there's quite a lot more to a story than just symbolic language. we use symbolic language to *describe* this hidden world that exists in the author's mind.

in this sense of words only being a description of this other world, I'm far more on board with jason's idea that these words serve kind of like access points -- sort of addresses to help you locate the world. these "authorised realities" are what authors do to allow their creation to live on, and for us, they have the benefit of creating reality for us.

the other day, I mentioned that I understood the role of legends and legendary people and that was because of the progression of desire. I need something (basic survival), to I want something (materialism), and then you realise that you are the thing you're looking for. the way you get there is through the concept of these legends. we idolise them in our minds saying, I want to be like them, and then after some time, you realise that you have become that legendary figure you wanted to meet, save you, love, whatever physical desire may appear, because on the inside you are signaling to yourself that you will like yourself if you're like this legendary character.

well, thank goodness we started out with zeus the storm god so that aspiring young children with a desire to also be legendary, grew up wanting to become a pouty serial rapist to also be legendary. these kinds of legends that we desired externally, and have subsequenty created them into our reality. they're like egregores of our own creation. they're created externally because we think of ourselves as incapable of being that legend. in that sense, words do *create* reality, however, which is quite different than words *being* reality.

---

you know, there is some truth to words shrouding or covering over the conceptual reality. this was the major struggle that I had as a child because -- like terence said, I wanted to behave like a machine, but more importantly I wanted *others* to behave like a machine so that I could understand them. I wanted them to speak clearly with me. I wanted them to have the honesty that a programmer has with her computer. it's just plain language, because if it's not plain, the program is inorrect.

all data is assumed to be understood (through the view of the program). therefore, what kind of ended happening, is that I started to see myself from the perspective of the program. I thought that I could figure everything out -- and, you just have inputs and outputs -- so if I know the inputs and outputs, I know everything.

turns out that the inputs and outputs aren't units, but more like waves. they behave and interact with things that they resonate with, so to "get" (receive, understand) the real concept behind the shroud, it's all about signal reception. definitions are our own, which are the concept (in our perception), but then there is the *actual* concept behind that shroud of our own (or someone else's) definition.

so here's this weve based reality but I feel binary and unit-based in my thought, so I have to figure out what thing is a thing. I really like the "data structures" in the conceptual realm much more because anything similar (all derivataves) resonate with its parent concept and other concepts that compose it. every data structure links to every other data structure that it's similar to, which are all the ones that composed it; much easier memory alignment for me...

look at it as three parts. there is the female, and she transmits and receives on the frequency of her concept. she is the "actual" concept. then you have the "shroud", which are the two males. the ground is your definition of the concept, and the emitter is the culturally, narrated, handed down, or acquired in some way definition of the concept. the ground (your definition) is constantly taking the energy from the emitter (the narrators) and comparing with with the actual concept (the female) and making adjustments to it, trying to maintain that it feels good. the ground is basically finding a compatible interface between the female (the actual concept) and the emitter's (narrator) concepts. the ground (just like in electricity) uses the female's (sun's) energy to power the created reality of the "authors" (jeortau/prometheus, zeus/ra, mercury/thoth, mars/aries).

this concept works individually and also collectively. this is the importance of the progression of desire because we're passing the materialism phase now. it'll peak sometime in the future, and at the height of such an abundance reality, it'll be natural to realise that it's not the stuff outside, but the thing that goes between bodies that matters. *I* am/have the thing I was looking for another person. we become the legends we're looking for.

### 2022-11-30 13:05 - gradualism vs individualism

one of my main critisisms of terence (and it's most visible in his humour), is his obsession with individualism. what I mean is that everything needs be a unit. it has to have a defined boundary -- and it's only in the context of psychedellics that he allows himself to think like a gradualist.

in reality, both of these perspectives are valid and speak tremendously of its dualistic nature -- and so therefore it is the goal of both the human and the machine to see both of these perspectives.

like I said, it appears dual but it's much easier to understand when it's seen as three. I'll put it into church cathedral builder speak here. you have the father, which is the real concept (the one in 5d), then you have the son, which is the emitter (the one in 4d), then you have the lesser one or the fool (the one in 3d). the concept itself is gradual and so because of its ever changing nature, it's a contradiction or paradox to itself because itself is eternal. that concept will exist for eternity for as long as someone keeps accessing it.

then, out of this father, there are the two sons: one is the good son, and the father hands him all of the enjoyable tasks, and then the other son that has to deal with all of the problems. when thinking of something to do for his son, the first one always comes to mind. if he's not available, then he thinks of friends. it's only an afterthought where the father would remember the foolish son. the foolish son is the ground. it's your physical definitiion of reality and what those concepts mean. this is your body -- your physical mind/brain.

but then the valiant good son is always there to take all the fun away. he's a total attention whore and just wants to be the star of everyone's attention. he's a real charmer, you know. everyone loves him. that's your 4d reality there.

therefore, it's important to be able to see the individual reality, whether it's the fool or the son or some combination thereof -- but also to be able to see the gradualistic perspective.

on this subject I'm much more closely aligned with jason with his definition of "spectral" -- with the emphasis that this reality actually has a spectrum to it, and not *only* the individualist perspective.

#### 2022-11-30 13:25 - followup about the father analogy

I used the symbol of the father and his two sons, because I have demonstrated multiple times elsewhere that the "father" is anatau/ninhursag -- and she's a real con-artist. she's so many different people to so many different people. I think she could also shapeshift and/or appeared as the rendering of the person's concept of her -- as in, sexy if they like her or a real bitch if she's on their nerves. I think she often times appeared as male to people because that's how humans were built to perceive to perceive her kind of energy, as masculine.

she combines all of the energy of all of the things that could go wrong into a physical incarnation. she was a real troublemaker so she got labled masculine because women (normal non-psychotic ones) all behaved naturally as very nurturing and caring. we can thank her for our definition of what it is to be "female" or male. the men get that definition of being the summation of all the things going wrong. I actually believe it's encoded in our DNA -- another thing we inherited from the "gods".

therefore, since you all know the father is actually a woman, it's interesting to look at the same analogy of the "father" with two sons, but to also see it as a mother with two sons (see the difference in how it feels?) or a mother with two daughters -- or father with two daugthers. the way that we play out the archetypes of forethought, illusion, ideas, grandiosness, pomp, pride, passion, etc. in comparison to the daily grind is a common trope, therefore, imagine a "father" or a psychotic crazy woman (that appears as a man to most), as the source of these two "sons" (or daughters). the "father" is the "real" unchanging concept.

the father can be seen through the gradualist perspective, which is one of aromas, fine wine, and other gradualist forms of pleasure. or, the father can be seen from the individualistic perspective.

these are the egregores of our creation. don't expect zeus to change, because he is the unchanging concept manifest into reality. they won't ever change. the only thing that we have power over are the two sons. you are one part forethought and one part afterthought/regret and this is what composes/authors your reality. pay attention to see if you're seeing from the fool or from the sun/son's point of view.

perspective matters; and, even required to see beyond 2d.
