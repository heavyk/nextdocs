# metal lucifer

this blog is dedicated to writing about consciousness and other subjects that interest me while listening to metal and other dissonant things.

the contrast between the brilliance in my thoughts and the landscape of the music is delightful. however, I find it very difficult to carry on my thoughts while they talk, so I usually take a pause at that time and just listen to their studio jabber.

this is a totally crazy experience so far. I want to explore a new area of self-sacrifice and dissonance here.

inspired by seriah azkath.. listening to "last exit for the lost"

### 2022-06-18 22:18 - metal lucifer

I listened to snake-bros #099 - seriah azkath today and it totally blew my mind. he's really smart -- and I bet that's from being kinda plunged into a hyper attraction from his "morbid kundalini" experience going through puberty.

I had basically the opposite thing happen for me. I can't really remember what life was like before the brain haemorrhage now, but it seems to me that I saw in 4d and I got the sense that I may have had the kundalini risen since a very early age. attraction was fast so I think that's why I ended up with the brain haemorrhage, because I had serious emotional outbursts.

anyway, after listeneing to the show he plugged his show, "last exit for the lost" which has a bunch of metal music on it. I haven't listened to metal music in quite a long time. some of the songs transport me into a whole nother landscape. it's difficult to explain because each song is like this epic trip through a foreign space, then he starts talking in the studio and I have no idea what he's talking about because I don't know any of these bands really.

I just love the constantly changing landscape that these metal songs provide. I just went to the bathroom and when I got in there and just thinking to myself, all of a sudden all of the reactions to the stuff I previously wrote today start to come rushing back in, so I wanted to try and see what would happen if I were to try and write about that with metal playing. it's a bit of a collision of realities right now, but I'm gaining clarity quickly. so here goes...

---

I wrote about bigfoot, but in order to get my concept across, I had to connect up a lot of disperate ideas I had written about previously into a cohesive narrative of why I think that bigfoot, fae, and grey aliens are all connected and members of the conceptual plane, projecting downward (or, from our perspective, we're perceiving a shadow or an consciously compatible instatiation of a "concept") -- and the weird thing is that's kinda what seriah was saying in the show.

it seems that he's pretty sensitive, so that sorta stuff is perceivable by him (same with joshua, which I didn't know but is apparently a regular(?) on his show), and so all of that is really cool. I'm very impressed that someone out there is putting these phenomena together and looking at it through the astral lens. he briefly explains that his girlfriend and him could see the multi-coloured point lights in the graveyard, and said that we all see things differently, but that's where he left it.

because I'm kind of avoiding the astral plane, I have so many questions for him (or joshua who also clearly knows something about it). I've only been a member of the astral plane for maybe a total of about 20-50h (hard to say because a lot of that time was watching stars or on drugs) over the course of about 20 experiences or so, so I don't have nearly as much experience as he does.

man, I *really* wish I knew some of these types of people to talk to sometimes. anyway, that's not what I wanted to talk about...

for example, I can explain the tree moving for two guys but not the other... when I had my brain haemorrhage, I would move my arm and I would see it move, but I assure you I was not moving my arm because it was paralysed. I even pushed myself up off of the floor and saw my eyesight altitude off of the floor, but still I assure you I wasn't moving. there came a sudden realisation that I was still on the ground. it took a while for my brain to realise that I was still on the ground, because I was seeing the reality simulation in my head, not reality itself.

you see, the time it takes for signals to get to the brain is way too slow for anyone to have instant movement, so the brain has a complete model of reality and and you move around in it instantly have full sensation and everything. the imagination is an extremely good simulator of reality (you can do experiments in your mind) and so when you're looking out in your eyes, you're not actually seeing reality. everyone is seeing their imagination, and then when the brain gets a signal the contradicts the model, it error corrects.

if you look at something in your imagination, you'll notice that there is a space between you and what you're looking at (this is normal 4d). what happens when the kundalini rises (at least for me) is my vision now starts to look like my imagination does and there's a space between me and what I'm looking at. this means that I can see feel, touch (all of the senses) all of these physical objects now *as if they were imaginary objects*, so that makes all of the senses feel more enhanced and everything.

seriah also gave the example of anonymous consciousness getting rendered by the mind as a thing and so then it sticks, so the next guy looking at that bit of consciousness would be more likely to see it as a whatever the last guy saw it as. so if that consciousness talks to you, you can easily see it talking and hear the words, but other people not tuned into that will see or hear it. this includes all senses, so the ground vibrating from the tree shaking doesn't seem at all out of the realm of possibility. many things happen to me in dreams that feel much more dramatic than that in dream space (also astral) and my body wasn't moving then either.

the simulation that everyone is talking about is inside of your brain. we're just interpretting data (vibrations) into more and more "real" things. a part of the brain fails and this is extremely apparent, trust me :)

OK, so in @[random-thoughts](2022-06-18 11:31), I talked about how alalu/lucifer was originally the guy that decided to leave the power structure and do things his own way, but he was so successful at it, I believe for many reasons, he decided to start creating consciousness designed to defeat himself.

I explained how there were probably a lot of entites that joined him in his endeavours out on tiamat, and these were mostly entites from the tech civs that just like good conditions (there's nothing wrong with that).

so you have the power structure over on mars that have a superiority complex, and I think that was an intentional thing. I don't know how much I believe the whole "INFECTED ONES" narrative, honestly. reason is because I'm pretty sure alalu created tons of awful entites (demons or whatever in this conceptual realm) and also a whole lot of martians as well that were real difficult guys designed to keep alalu down and they were designed with power and superiority complex designed to keep and endless power struggle going on between the various factions. over the time the weaker factions were "destroyed" but because you can't really kill something that's eternal, they just lost their physical bodies and had to keep trying to get back into physical bodies by manipulating the astral realm.

the astral is a mix of physical and conceptual (like I esplained above). so in order for these conceptual entities to get back into bodies (to be able to interact with the physical again), they have to trick people capable of percieving the astral plane, and then we do the reality creation -- meaning that any physial effects that happen in the physical are all created by us. if the wind blows, that could be just your model but it could start to take an effect on reality (just like cloud busting), but if more than one person experiences the same thing it enhances that effect in physical reality even more.

I believe therefore that most of these entities are masters at finding ways to get humans to create the reality they want for theirselves (both the incarnated ones and the disincarnate ones alike).

consciousness is a weird thing and I think that a lot of the "pultergeist" stuff is just people manifesting their emotions into reality, which, like he said is why it mostly happens to pubescent kids, mostly the girls in difficult situations or settings. I can say from my experiences that they were all directly correlated with the emotion I felt in that setting.

---

oops, derailed again... still didn't get to talking about what I wanted to talk about which was lucifer/alalu.

I believe that he's basically playing a game where he's trying to do the impossible (or at least I think it's impossible), so that's why I pose the question: do you think it's always possible to defeat yourself?

if you had unlimited access to put thoughts into your head and to rearrange timelines so that you have constantly appearing people trying to thwart your efforts, do you believe that you could defeat yourself infinitely?

I believe it's possible to do. if it's not possible, that'd be a pretty interesting revelation to find out what is the weak link, and then once that's figured out what are the possibilites to try and improve the physical apparatus that's weak? I'm fairly certain that the weak link probably is going to be something physical, because in all of the layers above it, you can just do a simple transformation to find out the opposite frequency. now, how that manifests here in the physical will not be that perfect opposite frequency; it'll have imperfections and limitations to it so a more rapid method of manifestation will be necessary -- a method to manifest physical reality at the speed of thought.

here's another idea to think about: if the atlantians had the capability to manifest reality instantly and time machines to rewind time back (to undo any mistakes), do you think they could have held off the catalcysm infinitely?

what I mean is, I'm sure that it's possible to continually come up with technologies that can dampen the earth vibrations, and so if they had some sort of genius that was able to continually come up with ways to dampen the vibrations in the earth at the speed of thought, would it be possible?

strangely, for this one, I think not. it seems to me like they could go for really long but then there would be some sort of limit that is reached with the output of the sun, meaning that the sun is eventually putting out such powerful energy to make the feeling of those on earth manifest, that eventually it would have to happen.

so, maybe the first one isn't possible either -- but it seems to me like a really cool idea because if I could self-sabotage myself enough, eventually instant manifestaton would be possible, and that would be really cool.

---

OK, I'm done. my resume of this is, I definitely have a lot of distortion in my thoughts when listening to metal -- and I feel really weird the whole way too. I'll probably do it again cause it's so fascinating. I'm writing about the nature of consciousness and then seriah comes on and gives the other guy in the studio a bit about how he needs a lap dance and how much porno everyone should have. it's a total mind trip. anyway...

### 2022-06-19 00:00 - one more thing about metal lucifer

I totally derailed my original idea for the entry (I don't really know why it keeps happening -- I'll get better at this) because I didn't talk about the reaction to @[random-thoughts](2022-06-18 11:31).

there were various reactions to it and the one that felt most from nosebook was a feeling of unknowing what to do -- because they're so used to pushing against people, what on earth are they going to do if I keep self-sabotaging? what I mean is, if I'm focused on unwanted and if they too are focused on unwanted, they need an offset. they're only able to focus on unwanted because many humans are uaually trying to figure out how to get wanted stuff, so that kind of puts them into a weird spot where they have to find a way to get people to look at wanted to offset their own perception of unwanted.

it's a good thing that compartmentalisation exists because I think it's going to be hard for them to look at unwanted and wanted at the same time.

---

the other reaction that was present is so hard to get to with this music playing it's nearly impossible. I remember it had something to do with the idea of ... OH, that's right. I wrote about how in the story of alalu, the martians couldn't allow alalu to do so well, so they tried to be the superior and were forced to destroy lucifer/alalu.

so, the story of lucifer that's in dtp is that he's a magnificent being of light but he was too ambitious and his over ambition is what caused his destruction. that's kinda the opposite of the story I told.

the other story of lucifer that I've heard is the one where he's very proud and wants to elevate himself above "God" and so because of his pride, "God" (enlil) had to put him down to a more humble level.

this is the story that I was getting reactions to, because I'm essentially proposing that alalu just wanted to do his own thing but he lives in a reality with others that can't allow him to create anything that he wants, so they choose to bring him down to his level.

---

well, like I said, I don't really think that's the case. I think that enlil was created by alalu. also, like tesla and also jesus, I believe he was successful in his creation, but realised that unwanted is the same as wanted, so instead of trying to destroy the opponent or prevent the creation from being destroyed, why not continually make more and more formidable opponents that he designs to defeat himself? each iteration he'll get more and more powerful and each and every time he defeats himself, he benefits by gaining more power.

either lucifer really is a super arrogant power-hungry guy and he's in an infinite loop trying to defeat himself, or it's quite possible that there's something bigger going on here.

the channeled "et view of creation" by kuthumi has an interesting tidbit in part one:

> This prior Universe that existed and grew and matured and then passed through the transition. And so, *just as now*, we of the hierarchy of this planet, joined with the hierarchies of other planets and the cosmic council, are working for *the maturation of this Universe*.

the channeler here (the same one telling the story about the "INFECTED ONES") is claiming that this universe is getting so big that it's ready to get this universe ready for its maturation, death and rebirth. the way he explains the "rebirth of the universe" is like this:

> When you think of the transition, a small scale of that transition would be what you refer to as a super nova. You can imagine a super nova multiplied by a factor of ten to the trillion; you will have the magnitude of the transition energy of the prior Universe.

so you thought the younger dryas was a big catastrophe, wait till you see the one that causes the rebirth of the universe. the way I see this happening is basically the same setup that the atlantians had going on. you get a bunch of people dissatisfied with current conditions with the technology to try and prevent the catastrophe for as long as possible. they'll setup a system that creates the conditions that they want, but with the continuing dissatisfaction, it'll eventually create a nova that is very large.

you can see that in order to do that, you'll need something much larger than just a single star and planet. what I postulate that needs to happen to make such a large supernova would probably be a whole galaxy or a cluster of galaxies. if a normal star is going supernova is 10^1000000000000 times weaker, then that means that every star in an average galaxy needs to nova 10^10000 times larger than it normally does ... that's pretty big. I have no idea what could possibly do this, but I think you just take the basic "american way" of doing things to this galaxy idea -- just replicate it on a galactic scale and then replicate that. compartmentalise and conquer.

so what I mean is, I believe that we don't just need one lucifer, but hundreds of billions of lucifers. we've got to figure out a way to pump out lucifers -- guys that are willing to self-sabotage theirselves until they run up against physical limits. we'll just keep creating more opponents for ourselves until the whole universe can no longer hold it back anymore -- max disaster.

that's my theory on what's happening

### 2022-06-29 00:54 - felt like listening to seriah again

I don't really have anything specific I want to talk about here. when I was taking a shower I had a topic come to mind where I was thinking about in the sun while picking weeds -- about randall and his measurements and stuff. of I remember what it was now... anyway, I got done with the previous podcast with scottie baldwino and I felt like listening to seriah so I put on another "last exit for the lost" mix on the phone and laid down to start listening. I decided I want to write, so here I am.

---

when I was thinking about randall out while pulling weeds, I was reminded of a previous reaction that I had where I said something about randall -- dunno what it was now -- but I remember very specifically a reaction from kyle, something to the effect of like "don't get mad or try to fight at whatever it is, because it's all attraction and it'll just get worse. he's just just reflecting/manifesting your anxieties" -- it's hard to translate that one into english, so I got it kinda wrong, I'm sure but the sense was that I turn out to be this really dynamically transforming thing, so I end up kinda flip-flopping between the extremes for people -- they've always said that I'm very charismatic but you'll either love me or hate me. I don't usually get a "wow, that guy is boring or uninteresting" response.

anyway, that had a resonance to it because I thought of right nearby to that moment a joke I told this morning to jaron about jim lucas getting "the final frontier thing wrong" -- a joke from kyle I repurposed for the moment.

the other resonance that it had was later when I was listening to the scottie baldwin analyse a little bit the success of their show, and at ep #110, they were still probably not nearly as well known as they are now -- and they were explaining their technique to making the show, which was they had these conversations already, so it was just a way to get out there and make the conversations available for others to listen to.

scottie praised them multiple times for allowing people to kinda lis

[break to listen to songs and interview]

scottie praised them multiple times for just getting out there and thinking it through out loud. he explained that one of the most tantalsing things that a person is if you can watch them thinking about and processing something that interests them -- and he thinks it's their out-loud thinking process which is so compelling for people to listen to. we've already heard the mainstream "we already know how it works (but not really)" explanation, so it's good to listen to interesting questions and insightful takes on modern mysteries[^1].

I'm sorta like that, and I was really thinking about how nice it must be for people to watch me process things. that's really all I'm good at. it's so hard for me to fill people's expectations, and I don't really pretend to have all of the right answers -- I just collect a lot of things, think about it for a while and then just talk. a lot of the things that scottie was praising randall about, I can kinda apply to myself as well -- cept for the "hyper competency" -- as I seem to not really have any specific thing I'm really good at. I'm sorta bad, average, or kinda good -- but nothing I'm like a superstar at doing.

---

anyway, so I was listening to one of the songs at the beginning and the screaming reminded me vaguely of the sound that pigs make and that reminded me of the reaction...

in @[dreamlog](2022-06-28 12:12), I mentioned the idea that I am the "bad guys" -- and that all of the "bad guys" that are trying to keep everyone away from all of the good conditions are mostly extensions of me. I was reminded of the one passage in the bible where jesus drove out the demons into the pigs and said something to the effect of -- "we're not legion yet" -- with the idea that jesus would be returning in the form of many demons. the reactions are telling me that I have that waaaayyy off. I don't mind. I'm listening to metal.

OK, that was an interesting blending of what I was writing with the music. it's always really weird when that happens. anyway, that thought mixed with the idea my speculation of what *really* happened to the 5th planet (tiamat), because I postulate that this was the planet where lucifer (alalu) setup a really cool setup and the really good conditions that environment had attracted a lot of astral entities. the power hungry ones went to mars and the good-condition loving ones went to tiamat. the mars guys with a superiority complex had to put such a proud person down, so they likely infiltrated his setup, ran it into the ground and then had it destroyed. the legends say that the demise of lucifer resulted in a lot of "angels" (both good and bad) -- which I believe to be astral entites that took on physical form, and then after taking on physical form are now stuck in a reincarnation cycle to similar DNA. those early humans may have even been something like the neanderthals, -- but the extra effort the martian "gods" went to to ensure that the humans had a different bloodline point to the fact (at least for me) that they wanted to ensure that the angels coming over from tiamat continue to retain their affinity to earth-like DNA and bodies.

obviously intermixing happened, which is why it was such a big deal for marduk to take on a human wife, but the point is that I believe that in addition to the many "good" angels (there isn't really any bad or good -- just wanted and unwanted) became the many benevolent people that have appeared through the ages. I believe the astral realm has been kept a secret and a lot of those that interact with that realm have their oaths of secrecy (see @[letters-to-russ](2022-05-19 14:19)), but I don't have any such obligations -- so I talk about it openly. I claim in that letter to russ there that I believe my open talking about it is why "the book is open".

you see, randall makes a lot of very interesting remarks in words directly out of the book of revelation. scottie noticed this too and remarked that words, and the order you put them in, matters. so, when randall says, "the book has been opened" this a very symbolic reference.

I was also reminded of the first time that I saw him (can't remember what it was but there was a green board behind him) -- and it blew my mind that he went into the metrology of the book of revelation. another time he was talking about the furlongs of the new earth and I went on a search for planetary bodies in this solar system that match the size of his furlongs (I wrote something about it in nosedocs too I believe), and I determined that it had to be the planet pluto, but I didn't really know what to do with that -- cept that it's the god of the underworld, and various gods are said to go there. I didn't think much more about it though.

[another break]

anyway, I think I remember writing about the "new earth" a while back, and I don't really remember all of what it's about, but one of my goals for a long time now has been to try and make it possible for the ones who like good conditions to get the conditions that they want -- and the realisation of this effort is finding out a way to make the "new earth" possible. in my "I want to make a galaxy" mindset, I see this as a perfect setup because in my desired setup for the galaxy, I need two planet like objects in orbit with each other and both planets will have strong attraction to eachother.

pluto is the planet that will contain all of these guys that like the geometry and good conditions and stuff like that (the tech civs), but my planet (charon) will be the ones that are not quite as interested in the realisation of feeling good through technology, but perceptually (or maybe "spiritually" -- but I hate that word).

I see this as a perfect setup because I believe that pluto/gaga (+-4) comes from saturn and the moon/kingu (+-6-+) and charon (+2) come from tiamat, so you can see that this is a perfect setup for the astral entities there. saturn is a solumn god that likes to have everything in order and having all of the laws kept. you could consider him to be the god of "karma" in the sense that he desires that everything have a system of "compensation" -- so when I think about him, I immediately think of mol lang and his law of compensation and talking of karma...

---

the reaction that came with my thinking about the pluto and the 1000y-bloom was another passage in dtp where he talks about how all of the angels are able to make their own decison about how they want to operate, and then at the end of some period, everyone not in agreement with that will get thrown into the fire (vis mortus) and consumed. it's my belief that all of these "angels" (the ones that have been produced since then and the ones still extent since the original "casting out of heaven/mars") have been mostly avoiding a full death, and have been transferring from body to body -- so a forced dose of vis mortus (something like a nova event they can't avoid, which puts out so much energy, the astral vibrations which compose their astral body are no longer coherent, forcing their entrance into 5d/devachan) -- and I think that they have a pretty big fear of death.

along with this idea came the acknowledement reaction to the legends that supposedly lucifer created a lot of "bad" angels after that. it's my personal opinion that many of these enitites that all did the self-sabotage

[another break]

it's interesing how in the interview they were talking about wanting to live eternally. they both decided they didn't want to live forever because you would see loved ones die and things like that -- but imagine you did live for a very very long time, just transferring your consciousness from body to body -- I don't think you'd be too concerned about your "loved ones" anymore -- you'd be pretty calculating and self-centred. I also believe you would become exclusively materialistic, because there's no way to think about anything else, either. the "spirit realm" is just a hierarcy of power looking to take control of the resources in planes below them.

it would be miserable, I agree, but I don't think they would be too concerned with family or friends. my wife is going to die, so just get a new one -- friends go away too, so just get a new ones. so, since everyone is only a transient entity passing through my experience, I optimise my presentation to those temporary passer-bys to ensure that I get the most out of them as they pass through my experience. this means I'm very concerned about what everyone else thinks, and I don't have any real meaningful relations -- everyone is just a temporary thing for me to use.

though I don't think I would mind living eternally, I also don't find it a big deal because I know the art of releasing resistance, and so I imagine that life (for me at least) would be a continually improving experience the longer it is. neither do I believe that I would *actually* live forever, because if I'm constantly improving, then I'm getting more energetic, and so just the same as death, I would just transition into another thing. or, I would be low enough resistance to be able to release my consciousness and die because I wanted to. I believe that even if a machine were pumping energy into my body to keep me alive forever, I would be able to consciously make my transition in the form of releasing enough resistance to "die" -- or to transition into something more energetic (something like a transfiguration but more powerful).

what they're talking about though, is the "vis nature" -- which is where something is neither becoming more or less energetic -- and that is *not* something that I want to ever have. I prefer death myself, but I don't mind the idea of living for a very long period of time. I also don't really believe that I would see it as a curse to watch my "loved ones" die, either. I think I may be calculating and stuff too -- and I know that I have a very offensive view of death to a lot of people because I don't find it a problem. I find "preservation" to be a much bigger problem.

death means new. preservation means same.

---

OK, back to where I was... I was talking about how the legend is that lucifer *created* a lot of bad angels -- which fits right in line with my idea that those that have self-sabotaged, created dual versions of theirselves which project down into the astral (angels). so yeah, I do believe that this legion of bad angels and demons were created by those that have self-sabotaged -- starting with jeortau/alalu.

notice also that the three gods that are said to have self-sacrificied (saturn (+-4), osiris (+-6-+), and jeortau (+2)) are all the transiton regions, which created

[another break]

OK, so this time I noticed another resonance. he's interviewing addienne cowen in the episode I'm listening to (19-04-2020). I was going to talk about this later but I guess I'll do it now.

while I was contemplating these reactions and pulling weeds, the remi's son, luke is washing his car. I was out there thinking about the final really abstract part about this morning's dream (@[dreamlog](2022-06-28 12:12)) where I was talking about how I see girls the way I want to see them instead of the way they think they look. it's a pretty good quality to have, I guess... so then, to throw a wrench into that idea, he heads out in his car and comes back with a really tall girl that I thought was probably some girl from his highschool that he stayed in contact with and he brought her home to take advantage of the house being empty. I hadn't realised yet that it was probably eva (I can't see that far away and even if I could, I don't really know what she looks like anyway) -- and so I just assumed her to be this really magnificently hot girl that luke had picked up and took home.

I then flashed over to my thoughts on the venus and adonis thinking about how venus didn't think she was very hot and my discussion of patricia. I noted how much I really don't like extremely hot girls because I feel a lot of intimidation around them -- but then I thought about it -- because there have been many instances where I've been around hot girls and felt no intimidation at all -- I was just me. I couldn't really figure out what was the difference and why sometimes I really don't feel at all natural around them.

so then in this interview adrienne is talking about how she's going to go do a tour with this band avantasia, and during the experience she's describing how it's totally a dream come true for her but her insecurities are totally going full effect.

so to explain this, I originally started to listen to a different episode from seriah, and I saw her picture and it really attracted me so I went to read the text of the show, but instead of pulling up the show's page, it started to play the show. I decided to leave it, because it felt like my finger was influenced to press in the wrong spot. I start listening to it and I feel really excited to listen to it, but then a minute or so into it, it turns into a strong feeling of insecurity and disinterest.

it started to wane as I kept listening. I didn't really understand what that was all about until that last bit about avantasia because I again felt the same thing again... it's weird how she talks about everything being such a dream-like experience but at the same time totally terrifying.

she's a strong attractor, that's for sure -- and it really reminded me too about the episode this morning when I was thinking about how much I really dislike hot girls because it bothers me all of the expectations. I think there's something to it... breaktime again.

[another break]

so the synchronicities are all very often while I'm listening to this. she says, "we all love gothic architecture" and I have a desire to look at the clock and it says 04:32 -- crazy.

so back to where I was about the venus and her insecurities and how I think that's related to expectations. I think it has to do with the imagination. dreams are experienced in the astral (they're singing about dreams) and so the dreamlike experience is an extension of that. it's the mixture of concept and physical, so it's no wonder that concepts get manifested into a reality like that. I really hope that she can overcome some of her insecurities and stuff and just try to be the way she wants to feel, rather than the way she thinks people want her to be (I purposefully worded that with a "should" for irony).

so another thing in the interview was he was asking about the name for the band, "seven spires" and she said that 7 is like an important number and stuff.. as she's talking about it, I get a "picture" in my head about my 7 layers of perception, and each of the spires are these sorts of levels that you climb up on this -- it's hard to describe -- they looked like floating islands asending up and up into fantasy worlds.

anyway, she's a visual musician like chris is, so I get what she's talking about (resonance with scottie's interview -- I'm not 100% synesthetic because I don't "see" the things, but the image is "there" for me -- and I do see music as colours but also as fantasy or imagination experiences too, especially with chris). really cool.

OK, back to where I was. I was explaining how the three (she said 7 is cool but 3 is also cool too) self-sabotaging guys are the 2-4-6, and this is the path that energy passes to get to the astral (6) -- and I'd also like to point out that there is a progression between them too -- jeortau (+2) is just an emitter, so he receives astral (6) and emits relational (2), saturn emits and receivces on the midpoint (4), while osiris (+-6-+) emits and receives on both the relational and the astral. so, what we're looking at is a sort of upgrading -- going from assertion to reception.

OK, now I'm thinking about the reactions to the idea that these guys are all making their own "bad guys" and how I'm sorta saying that I can continue to do the same.

[break time]

man adrienne, it's been a really fun show so far (4h in), and I'm gonna go do something else now. this has been a pretty good ramble, but I know that it seeded a lot of future thoughts.. until next time! [4:44:54]

[1]: I realise that's a resonance in the "future" of that reaction, but you'll begin to notice that every one of my days has a sort of "theme" to it now and every single thing that happens has a resonance with something that happens earlier and also later on in the day. resonances span between days too, but they're less noticeable to me, and I think of those more as "trends", as there seems to be a lot that happens while I sleep.

### 2022-07-17 06:34 - is elijah aries?

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2VkP7kQtPA)

I'm listening to this fascinating conversation about the prophet elijah. supposedly he's the guy that announces the coming messiah. he's associated with john the baptist as well. he's a wild man, a loner, and a bit of a trickster. he's not angelic or divine, but seems to continually reinvent himself and in the process changes the pattern of consciousness around our concept of who and what "God" is.

I find his descriptions of this elijah guy matching me pretty closely, but he explains that elijah is now inside of everyone (sorta like how jesus is inside of everyone's heart), and so in a lot of ways, we're *all* elijah (again, this is something that I also say continually). so to channel elijah is to give good news, to show interest in something, to feel good, etc. he's thought of as similar to the "holy spirit" -- but if you've ever listened to abraham, they say that when you're channeling elijah, "you're in alignment with your source".

---

oh yeah, he's a bit of a shapeshifter too and can take on many forms, so when he was talking about that, the thought that popped into my head was the "seth material" where seth talks about an oversoul, and that "who you really are" (the oversoul) has multiple incarnations interacting with others and yourself in the physical. I say the same thing, and that the ultimate purpose of those alternate selves is create situations for yourself where you're forced to improve upon yourself.

so when I'm listening to this guy talk about elijah, I'm getting the picture of this oversoul. I call them conceptual programs (5d) or to have 6d (temporal) perception -- you can produce these entities at will, and then live out the circumstances you create (and then consequently attract) for yourself. elijah is one of these incarnations, john the baptist another, the green guy another more, and potentially enoch as well.

my point is, that if you were to have what I call 7d (temporal and multiple identity) pertception, then think about what it would like to be living. money no longer has any more desire to it, women are infinite, etc. -- I'll tell you that you begin to realise that the entire world becomes a reflection of yourself, and so the only one that really matters is you, and how you perceive the world around you. this is why I say that *you* are your own personal messiah -- and not anything else outside of yourself.

---

so what would *I* do if I were elijah? well, once I realise that the entire world is a reflection of myself, I would design a system -- a matrix where consciousness is controlled in such a way that physical conditions head in a direction of less and less control. the reason for this is that the ones that want to have control over their conditions, will need a saviour from tyrannical system which controls all of the conditions. they'll have to join the side of controlling conditons, or get in touch with their inner elijah. the ones that control conditons will eventually create the very controlling conditions that they want to have over others for theirself (you know, with sufficient technology, it could take rome 2.0 a really long time to fall). little by little I would continue to replace the power structures with more and more power-hungry demons. I'd basically become the "bad-guy", but it's not like it's only bad-guyness, because ultimately I'm creating this situation for *myself* -- the most difficult challenge for me to overcome. along the way in my passage through the challenge, I'm sure that I'd completely transform society and how it perceives itself.

I've touched on that before, but I'd like to put it in the context of another video on this guy's channel:

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7upQskK4LgY)

in that video he talks about a new race of hominid species called homo superior that will have begun to emerge by the year 2050-60. I believe that the new race he speaks of will be the "bad-guys" that are going to control the matrix. they'll be so superior to the human race -- but more like machines with human bodies rather than how they're depicted in the matrix. they'll be YHVH 2.0, omnipotent and all-knowing of everyone's thoughts (like the matrix agents but more knowledgeable), capable of shapeshifting and projecting theirselves into time and space just like elijah.

this new race will be so superior that it'll force us to evolve ourselves into something new -- or at least force *me* to evolve. my perspective on this now is that they can control every single physical condition on the planet, but they'll *never* be able to control your perception and how you feel about something -- even circumstances as difficult as that.

he describes that by 2040-45 there is a major event that happens, but by 2050 things are back to normal. this is clearly the sun. 2046 is the peak of the next gleissberg cycle, so that'll be the peak output for the sun. elsewhere I've explained that the solar output is driven by an interaction that our emotions have on earth which is what attracts the conditions for those emotions to manifest -- so what I'm saying is that many people won't make it through that. the solar output will get so intense, LOA will get so strong, every thought and emotion will have dramatic influence on those around us and our environment, that we'll kinda learn the hard way that we're all connected in this "matrix of consciousness". so, in otherwords, only the ones that figure out how to find a way to perceive their conditions in a way which feels good will survive it.

after that, you can imagine that things will go pretty much back to normal. every 88y or so, the gleisberg cycle will ramp back up again, and I imagine that each time, as everybody gets better and better at it, so because of our interconnectedness earth will contiually become both more energetic and more harmonious.

---

OK, so then I was thinking about this elijah guy and mishlove brings up the this sabbath (7th day/ray of "rest") meal:

    Melaveh Malkah (also, Melave Malka or Melava Malka) (Hebrew: מלווה מלכּה, lit. "Escorting the Queen") is the name of a meal that, as per Halakha, is customarily held by Jews after the Sabbath (Shabbat), in other words, on Saturday evening. The intent of the meal is to figuratively escort the "Sabbath Queen" (the traditional metaphor for Shabbat in Jewish liturgy) on her way out via musical performances, singing and eating, as one would escort a monarch upon his departure from a city. This meal is alternatively called "the fourth meal."

so, it's called "escorting the queen" and it's the "fourth meal". well, if you've been following my thoughts on the return of the 1st ray triad, in the form of vulcan (-5+), genxicat (-7) and allayandra/aries (+7), but this time he's got the "queen" (anatau) with him, so now with her, he's now a 1st ray (+-1-+). the queen there is the 4th (hidden) component in the triad (like the memristor), enabling the return back up. so, if you think of 1st ray triad being the original "godhead" -- we descend down into more and more gross matter -- down to the 7th ray. however, the 7th ray perspective is exactly the same as the 1st ray perspective -- just the 4th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st ray perspectives appear "backwards" just like the road on the return home looks "backwards" from the way it looked on the way out.

so this got me to thinking. imagine that mars *is* elijah. he starts out as a feirce warrior that destroys anything he comes across (7th ray emitter), but in this final incarnation, he's a 1st ray ground, having both masculine and feminine qualities. each iteration through physical existence, he's constantly had to redefine himself. as a 1st ray ground, he's perfect match for any 7th ray perspectives to enable their return back to source as well.

if I'm right, that means that from now on, everything gets *really easy* -- and it's only your own perception of the conditions that makes it difficult. if you feel it, you believe it, and if you believe it, it's real. you can manifest conditions, but really the reason why you want the conditions anyway is to feel a certain way. nobody is stopping you from feeling that way, now. then, once you can feel anything you want, you'll truly be in "the day of rest". you'll manifest anything you are capable of feeling, instantly. the matrix may be able to take it all away as fast as you manifest it, but they can't take away the feeling that produced the manifestation in the first place. eventually those guys (having elijah qualities) will follow in aries' footsteps creating a new reality forcing them to evolve (trust me as a 7d oversoul, you'll get bored quickly).

that's my theory anyway. everyone is becoming elijah, and each of them will all announce (create) whatever messiah they believe is the next one.

### 2022-07-17 15:42 - explain the most difficult matrix

first of all, imagine for a moment that I accomplished the capacity to project myself into any point in time and space and manifest anything I desired instantly. life will quickly get pretty boring because there's no conflict or unwanted to produce more wanted. I could manifest anything I desired -- be do, or have anything at a whim. *everything* from that perspective is a construct of my own perception. I need to produce unwanted for myself to evolve myself further.

there are a whole bunch of people out there, but they're completely incapable of creating conflict for me -- these bad-guys are all too easy to fight. I'm too powerful for them, so I have to construct bad-guys from my own capacity and then also handicap myself to ensure they have an edge.

in a world where someone has infinite capacity to limit me, they need to have infinite knowledge of the situation -- they would need to be as close to source speeds (speakinb in terms of frequency) as possible, and would have infinite capacity to reproduce as well. that world is a dystopia, with the bad-guys seeming to have all complete control -- which means that the rest of the people in the world (that aren't aspects of me) are also going to be stuck in this matrix that I'm creating for myself.

it's by design though because they're different than me, meaning they'll come up with unique and novel solutions to finding their connection, despite the difficult conditions. each time that one of the others finds their connection, they expose a weakness in the matrix -- which obviously will get fixed and improved upon.

therefore, after billions (perhaps more) have figured out how to find their connection, the matrix will get harder and harder until it's actually "impossible" to get out of. it's not really impossible, though. that's just a perception, so then I jump in and try it for myself; the absolutely most difficult run ever possible.

### 2022-07-23 03:46 - I don't want anything to do with them

yesterday, I edited my thoughts on sonnet 69 in @[my-sonnet-thoughts](2022-07-20 04:31), because I had copied the "modern" translation which changed a few really key words and some punctuation. after looking at it again, one of the main differences was the part about the praise and the mending.

the part about the mending is causing a bit of dissonance for me because ... well, let's just go over it real quick...

I've expressed in the past that I had no intention on being crowned king or to have any such power. I liken it to the tuenti departure of my past. I've learned a lot from that and I don't really think I would have decided to become the boss. I would have done a lot of other things attitudinally different, but I really enjoyed going off to the canary islands and doing my own thing there. it didn't work out well because I didn't understand the dynamic of dani[^1] and how to actually do what I wanted to do. the thing is, I didn't really know what I wanted to do anyway, so I was just sorta following him. I also sabotaged anything that we wanted to do by feeling like I lost my big opportunity to create the thing I want (tuenti) -- so I just wanted to drink, hang at the beach and smoke.

I related that again because there are a lot of parallels here. I don't want to be the boss at all. I figure there are a lot of people that want to run the show, so why would I try and suffer through doing something I don't want to do when there are others that want to do the boss thing. I relinquish that completely.

it basically goes like this: we keep doing what we're doing, and eventually I'll find my connection. once I'm connected, I'll do whatever I want to do. nobody can stop me. well, if they want to kill me, that's totally fine, as I'll just find my way through again. I don't really mind whatever it is they decide to do. I'm doing what I want to do and I don't really want to be involved with them.

the reason why I say that, is I started to get reactions about the idea of "mending" something -- and even when I looked into patricia, who I would consider that I have the most affinity to, it just feels like massive amounts of chuleria to me. I don't really want to be around people that see themselves as so much more superior to the rest. I prefer that everyone is equal, but the problem with that is there has to be a lot of secrets uncovered because secrets create inequality. it would require so much of their structure to be upended, that I don't believe it's a good idea to try and level a structure that has a very very tall power structure at its core. trying to change that is not only impossible, but a completely fruitless activity. it would be like me trying to get zaryn to run a flat company, when he wants power structures and chains of command. it never will work, no matter how hard I could possibly try.

I take the opposite path: I don't try and change anyone's structure anymore because it causes massive difficulty in their conceptualisation of reality. they don't know any other way to do it than to have power structures and secrets at the core. they need inequality for their system to work because if they were on the same level as thte others, they would be seen for who they are, not the image they present from up on high. I don't want to burst their system. they'll burst their own system by theirselves.

I don't think it's possible or even want to try and change their system. I also don't want to be apart of their system. I'll be a problem for them at every opportunity because I will want to know how all of the things work but they'll inevitably be secret. I'll also want to get rid of inefficiencies, but again, those are certainly not going to want to change either. there's *NO* no other option for me but to go and do my own thing, and that's exactly what I intend to do.

I don't mind if they want to use some of the technology that I'm going to develop. I also don't care if they try and meddle either, because they'll be part of the "contrast" and the unwanted part of the equation.

---

I want to take it step by step, but probably the first thing to do is to get off of the planet. I'll peace out on my own, so there's no reason to try and push me out. obviously, it's going to take a bit to get off of the planet, so I'll have to figure out how to do that.

the whole idea is so far out of my scope of vision right now, it's too hard to say all of the things it entails. obviously nosebook and them probably won't want me to leave, so we'll probably have an exodus sort of thing while the pharoahs try and keep me grounded.

probably the first thing to do is to try and figure out how to start my own star and build planets too. it seems like a big thing, so probably it's going to take a bit of planning and a lot of tests to figure out not only what's possible but to start getting an idea of what exactly will end up happening. I'm not really in any rush to do things, but obviously I'm going to want to go in the direction of creating a galaxy. I want to do it my way and I don't really want nosebook involved in it. I'll figure out how to do it the way I want to do it.

I can't really say how long it'll take me to figure it out, but it definitely doesn't need to be rushed, so I'll probably just fly around and visit various places around the earth (more fun than drinking) and just kinda hang out I guess. I'm sure they definitely won't want that, because it'll probably expose secrets or cause problems, but I mean dude obviously as soon as I can fly around I'm obviously going to... duh.

that's what "the one" gets to do. all of the secret society members have to show temperance and keep all fun out of it. they can have the ability, but they can't use it, unless it's justified, of course. poppycock, that's complete silliness. I'm going to have fun, of course. enjoy being serious and keeping everything all under control.

---

there's a second discussion here as well, and that is, "why would I allow them all the time to build their control systems and power structures, and then just peace out, leaving humans imprisoned?"

I definitely am not going to be doing that. everyone is inside of the system that they want to be in. the idea of living in a system where there isn't any secrets is terrifying to a lot of people. I can also say that it's my experience that given the opportunity to talk to me about anything they want to, they prefer to keep things extremely superficial. I'm not imprisoning anyone. this is the system that people want to be apart of.

I don't really have enough information, but it seems to me that nobody is forcing anyone to be a part of it, and instead it seems that people have *chosen* to be in it. even I doubt that I'll be able to escape their system -- just after some point I'll be able to do whatever I want and nobody can stop me anymore. that's the only difference. everyone has the opportunity to do that, too.

the only way to accomplish that is to feel the way you want to feel. it's not as hard as it sounds, but it may need some rearranging of beliefs and perceptions. most don't want to do that, so they prefer to stay where they're at.

if you ignore what others think of you and that you'll have to change some beliefs, making your only goal to feel the way you want to feel, I propose that if you are able to do that for 5 years consistently, nosebook won't be able to stop you. it sounds pretty easy, and it is, but you'll need to give up needing certain conditions or others' behaviour to be what you want. for example, whatever I do, shouldn't bother you because you know how to feel the way you want to feel.

I really don't want to be a part of any of this. as soon as I have the opportunity to do my own thing, I'd much prefer that than to anything they could possibly try and offer me.

---

OH, there's another question which is wondering about taking people with me... I don't even know what I want to do yet or what kinds of things are even possible. I'm completely unable to even conceptualise anything further than I'm sure there will be something that'll catch my interest.

anyway, imagine that I did come up with something cool to  do somewhere else -- would I just let everyone that wants to go, go? yeah, I guess... however, that many people would probably require another with a stable planet. I just don't know what the possiblities are, or even if there's another star (like vega) that has a planet waiting to have visitors. I really don't know what the situation is like, just I know that I don't want to hang out here with the chulos or try to integrate with their system. I really like the idea of figuring out what I want to do and then doing it. that seems like fun.

---

also, mending is kinda like forgiveness in that they need to have done something wrong in order to be forgiven, but I don't see any wrongdoing. I just see it as an opportunity, so from my perspective, there's nothing to mend.

I'm only looking forward anyway, so -- if I want to go do my own thing, I can do what I want because *it's what I want to do*, or I can do what I want because *I don't like the present situation*. in otherwords, I can go toward wanted or away from unwanted. so, the part where I just hang out and do fun stuff and figure out what I want to do is pretty important, so that I'm going toward wanted (rather than away from unwanted). see what I'm saying? mending could set that intention a bit better, but still I don't see anything that that's wrong, instead, it just looks to me like an incompatible situation. trying to integrate would be more effort and cause more conflict than just figuring out what I want to do and doing it.

eventually, I'll get bored of whatever that turns out to be, and probably will want to go another direction again or crash and burn or whatever. it's not like I'm planning on taking over the world. who knows, I could decide to just hand over the whole thing to them because they want more power and control again. personally, I like creating much more than I like maintaining, so perfecters and maintainers are always welcome.

[1]: that reminded me of a really weird dream last night where dani got in really close to me and was kinda like putting the moves on me, and I feared repulsing his advances, so I just let him touch me without any repulsion. it was weird to say the least. I looked into it right after I awoke and it seemed like they were testing to see if I was gay or something, because I remember I consciously had the thought that I don't feel aroused by his closeness and breathing.

### 2022-07-25 14:38 - speak to me

listening to left (2021-09-12) and there's a song that came on presumably called "speak to me" -- and I started off thinking about how whom are you asking to speak to you? or, are you pleading that someone speak to you in a way you can understand them? I dunnno really, but the song had a great phychedellic guitar bit that totally defocused me and was a pretty cool experience.

I was sitting there watching this game, "captain of industry" -- and I honstly don't know why I like it so much, but it's kind of like a visual way to see my mind at work.

I was watching this other guy on youtube (JD) make some builds and it was interesting to hear his thought patterns. it's a really self-introspective game for me because I'm not really playing it. I'm in a whole different world, where there isn't really much that's relatable to explain it. it's not even like it has psysicalness to it. I'm just sorta inside myself and there's this automaton playing the game ("me"), and I'm watching a bunch of automatons on the screen. the expereince is kind of like watching insects.

most people get scared of insects, so they never sit long enough to really get a good expeirnce watching them mill about. they're like tiny like robots. they show no emotion or anything recognisable as what we think of as conscious. they just go about doing stuff completely unaware of it possibly being a good or bad idea.

---

long explanation. I'm watching this game like I'm viewing a bunch of insects that are just following some sort of sequenced reactions to their environment, and the game is the same way.

I started to really begin to appreciate automatons, and I was thinking about the "observer pattern". it's a probramming term, and you have a piece of data or a varaible that you "observe" and any time it gets changed, it performss an action in response (usually calling a function with its new and previous value). they're not too dissimilar this "observer pattern" and insects.

ever since I started to write programs using the observer pattern, it totally changed my life. I've been looking for something to program using that pattern. I've been thinking about AI using that pattern, but my head can't quite logically perceive the result of lot's of variables anymore. I prefer things to be simple, and that was my problem with the observer pattern -- is that it's soo simple. if I tell you (as a probrammer), "with this code, everything that your code does is a reaction to their action -- and you'd look at me like, "duh dude, that's what computers are *supposed* to do. good job" -- so I've been pretty discouraged at how general it is -- cause let's say that I was writing a bot for a chat server or whatever -- again, (any server really follows this pattern), but it just listens and then reacts to some trigger words. it's nothing special.

---

anthor thing that I noticed is that in notwork games, you often want some sort of privacy or or element of surprise -- cause like imagine poker where you can see the other preson's cards, right, so an open communication protocol takes the fun out of games -- so I've been trying to figure out what kinds of games would be fun, if programatically, you could know, find out (or query for) anything in the the game at any time.

so that's when I started to think about how insects-like species are kinda like that. so imagine a game where the world is composed of millions of insects, but they're all users code that running. you're intereacting with millions of tiny bots in a world that's completely artificial.

in that world, you wouldn't really care to know what the opponent has becaues the wohole experience is novel. you're already interacting with a unique code that has been specIfically programmed by someone to do react in a certain way, so really anything could happen.

I suppose that competition could emerge in this world beween certain insect types, but they would have to be programmed in. factions could exist, and if they did, almost certainly, they would be a virtual representation of the progragrmmer's ideas in a visual space.

you could also have power structures and things like that, but because nobody ever acts directly (it's just their code that's interacting, and it'd be cool if it's possible to query their code, just like it's possible for anything in the world to be queried. the world is the code) -- because in the end, each bot script is self-contained and acts only on it's own programmed way -- so there's no way for the programmer to get into the world and act directly. they can only observe it through perspective of the bots.

you'd say, well what about complicated stuff like a neural network? I say, no. it has to be human-readable text and images that that has a defined scope. the programs are given a limited world to exist in (think like a virtual machine or something where native code never directly executes), so you don't even get outside access. you can only play the game fro the prespective of the bot. there are just a bunch of people writing npc code and then pushing up their new version to the server. they have all the same functions that an npc would have like entity lookups and stuff like that. you're wrinting your game character, but you can never directly control the character -- just put the char in the infinite diversity of environments that others will come up with and just see how it responds.

I believe that the first thing people will do is give up trying to make a bot that acts like a human. you'll have all sorts of bizarre stuff that you see only in the insect world, like impaling your partner with with a sex organ, then bleeding to death as the insectlings are born -- insect stuff, right? -- like that -- cept, you can't really "kill" a program, so these sorts of things would become very strange interactions. I just like npcs, they're endowed wih the features of the game, so maybe haelth for one game, but another may have health and armour, while another could have a whole clothes system with leveled up stats -- stuff like that.

like, ther's this one scene in half-life where the guy get's pulled into a vent and makes screaming sounds and then guts fly out. that was his moment in that game. your character doesn't have to be  designed to be somenthing big and spectaular.

as more of of these characters get created, you could imagine making moviess where you put all the stars into the world, and just see what turns out. some may be like reading madlibs, and other times it could take things a different direction. stuff, like "did you see the woman in the red dress? I programmed her" -- as you're never directly doing any action. you just write a scrit and then see how it plays out with other characters and in different environment rules.

---

blah. enough of thta idea. I liked the part about the observer pattern much more.

peace.

so, I'm listening to metal bjork, perhaps, space pads and ambience. yep, can't understand anything she's saying... lol. I guess it was just an epic intro and in my mind it felt like I'd been listening to the same song for at least 5-10 mintutes.

sabias nocturnos
iniciando la senda
fortalecen su pasion
observa -- su, ilusion

---

anyway, I've always found it strange that the "observer" is a system of reacting, while I've never used "react", but I know it's more about models than reacting.

I really like the idea of automatons

### 2022-08-24 11:42 - girls, friends, and drugs

before I begin the main topic, I wanted to talk about something seemingly unrelated, but because they're together in my mind, they may have something related.

yesterday or this morning (can't remember which one) I made the comment about girls... it started like this: I said that I like doing what I'm doing. in fact, this time where I'm just listening to jason's videos and writing any and all ideas that come to mind is very enjoyable for me. I really really like it. I don't see that happening at all with girls around. like, it's just not possible for me to focus my attention, especially on another dude, because that would mean that I'm neglecting or rejecting her; at least, that was my experience with raquel, anyway. I also don't really find it very often that I listen to a girl and say to myself afterward, "wow that was really mind-opening". there are a few excptions, like for example when I first heard nancy cohen, she blew my mind, but it's usually not the case at all. in general, it's men that blow my mind or inspire considerable thought most often. however, even men pale in comparison to a good joint, mushrooms or a ayahuasca ceremony. there just isn't any comparsion.

so, if I'm wanting a condition that makes me feel good and also opens my mind, I choose drugs, always every time. there isn't any substitute to it because the drug is just allowing me access to my own inner self, and it's self-discovery that I'm all about. girls don't tend to facilitate self-discovery in any relationship that I've ever seen. in fact, the opposite is often true where I notice that the dude is attempted to be "tamed" so that he can be something prensentable that she can show off to her friends -- or, if she likes sex, she'll just do that and the dudes she's with will never be presented to her friends, because they're unacceptable or inferior to her.

as a result of this taming of wild kenny, I'm deterred away from thinking or saying things that her friends would find unacceptable. this is the exact opposite of a mind opening experience. this is essentially what culture and ideology does to you, and so I kinda stay away from that. in order to prevent being tamed by her, I can't become friends with her; I just see her as an object of pleasure -- but I want to actually like the person I'm with, and if she's just there for pleasure, then I'm going to go with drugs because I want to have my mind *opened*, and also experience pleasure.

therefore, girls don't make very good drugs, and IMO, they don't make very good friends either.

after this comment, I got a number of reactions to it, because I think there is a discontinuity of what a "friend" is. so I tried to figure out what people think friend is... some people think it's someone that you can "trust". OK, I don't have any secrets, so I don't have any secrets to entrust them with. in the other sense of the word, I know that everything that happens *is attracted*, so it's also senseless to trust that they won't do something unwanted to me, because it's all attracted anyway, so if it happened, with someone I trusted or not, the person at fault is *ME*! so, I don't really need someone I can trust.

annother definition was someone I can confide in -- but same thing as trust there... I can talk to anyone about *anything* as there are no artificial barriers that anyone has to overcome for me to begin to "confide" in them. in the other sense of the word, I can ask them for their opinion on something, but I'm not out there trying to solicit others guidance. when I think of confide, I think of that one scene in "the truman show" where his friend tells him he can confide in him over beers. so, no girls don't make good friends.

---

you have to say that I'm stating this concept in negative case. I don't really find friends or drugs to be all that helpful -- though they can be when one is still very socially minded, drugs, most notably will open one up to the idea that the inner world is just as vibrant (or more) than the external one, just a bit different. friends can offer opinons, but they're usually telling me what I want to hear anyway -- which is what's nice about drugs, because drugs allow me to see what I'm wanting to hear and allow me the space to think about it, too.

drugs aren't for everyone. most people need friends, because drugs are too truthful for them. friends help to maintain the illusion that we live in by reinforcing that all of the external stuff is what really "matters" (literally, like atoms and stuff) -- when what really matters is not any of that; what really matters is how you perceive it.

at the same time as I'm promoting drugs here I'd also like to say that, as someone with a long history of drug usage, I don't really recommend drugs either. like I said, I'd rather be listening to these videos that jason has and writing out new ideas. when my mind is fully opened, then I'll be fine with girls, but until then, they're most certainly a very mind-closing experience, just like most people are. I'm probably even getting to the point now that it's possible that drugs are actually a mind-closing experience for me. last new years when I smoked with greg, I found the experience to be kinda uncomfortable and focused me in a way I didn't really want to focus (on what people think about me). so no, I don't really think that drugs or friends are the way to go.

---

in the process of thinking about what a friend or a person that I would like to be around would be like, I was thinking about different opportunities that I've had for friends. I mentioned that in my process of exlporing jason's videos, I feel very differently about the reactions -- which is that I feel encouraged to explore sensitive or taboo subjects, because (I think) philosophy is about taking a critical look at some of the more difficult to understand parts of reality.

I contrasted that by saying that I probably passed up on the opportunity to get some friends by not joining the snake-bros discord. I said that I felt like it was difficult to just talk about what I wanted to talk about. now, whether that is nosebook scared about me talking about taboo subjects in the open on their discord server or something real where they do have a list of very taboo subjects that shouldn't be talked about or not, I don't know.

long into to this part. so I was just outside pulling weeds[^1] and I was thinking about my conclusion on why I didn't want to join snake-bros discord, and it was really weird because the first impression that I had was not actually that I would have gotten along too well with the discord group at all, but actually the friend that I would have missed out on making was kyle.

so then after thinking about that (or maybe it was earlier in the shower), I got another impression that in there may be rising chuleria in the snake-bros arena, and my commentary on jason's videos is actually pretty refreshing because I'm not really pushing against problems in society, but instead I'm looking to find new ways to look at things. each of those discussions illuminates a new aspect of society that I hadn't even really considered and it's all really crazy because, for example, in the last entries I identified 3 aryan ideological conflicts, but in reality I was capable of arriving to these ideas because I'd contemplated similar things in terms of corporate conquest and team-building and software development.

that recognition of those corporate things that I experienced in tuenti served as a basis for a lot of mental expansion for me, and I suddenly started to think of myself looking at things from kyle's perspective: imagine for a moment that there is rising chuleria (I experienced this in tuenti), and I had provided the engineering to get the whole project off of the ground, I overlay zaryn over russ, and so at some point, I realise that it's not going the direction that I'm wanting it to go, so I end up having to let the whole project go. when looking at it this way, I noticed that in tuenti, I always believed that the name was "tu en ti" (you inside of yourself), but zaryn say it as "tu entidad" (your entity/property). besides this being the same discussion of what I thing about girls and friends[^2], I noticed that if kyle walked away from it, it would be the same thing. originally, the title would have been "(kyle and russ) of the serpernt" whereas now iw would be "(hombres hermanos) of the serpent" -- same title, but different meaning.

I also noticed that there was great similarity in how even though kyle is providing all of the engineering for the project, he never really wanted to be active in the discord. this is analogous to me never really wanting to join zaryn in the "pijo" lifestyle where I could exert my corporate influence to get the girls or the nightlife that I wanted. that was always in the backdrop of tuenti, and I preferred to instead do my own thing (ie. drinking and drugs). I was on a self-discovery mission, and they wanted to have social intercourse that I didn't find to be very mind opening or expanding. their goals were different than mine.

after that, I was reminded of a reaction to a previous entry (@[blahblog](2022-08-18 23:10)) where I noted that I was enjoying my self-discovery, and if I were wanting to reach out, I would do so, siting that I sent a weird email to rupert sheldrake. the reaction was saying that the email made it sound like I was a reincarnation of terence, which I don't really think was the case. instead, the way I've resolved it to be is that terence wanted to see humankind not fail so badly (he talked about it extensively), but was so focused on the problem, he didn't know how to allow it, so he was actually holding away the thing he wanted. therefore, I think it would be more accurate to say that when he finally passed he finally gave up on trying so hard (which is probably what killed him), and when he finally let go, I got hit with something[^3] that could begin a cascade of events which would lead to what he wanted.

it's the letting go part that's important. I experienced this in tuenti as, what caused me so much negative emotion is that I originally thought that tuenti going away and getting becoming something I didn't intend it to be, made it impossible for my desire to actually manifest. I had to give it up.

OK, so finally here (after a break), what I want to do now is to try and brainstorm on the opposite of my critisisms... so, if they're not good as drugs or friends, then what are they good for? be back soon. goona pull weeds

[1]: I find it really interesting that the more lucid I start to get, the more I enjoy going out to pull weeds. in reality, I like a whole lot of things more, but there's something nice about just going outside and doing something mindless, letting my thoughts wander while listening to happy bird and the pueblo train survice.

[2]: I want a mind opening experience where I can learn more about myself, and so I pass on girls (your property) to instead go for the drugs (you inside of yourself)

[3]: the other weird thing about this was when I wrote that entry, I had just listened to an interview that nikkiana jones did with jason where she started off by asking him why he dedicated his book to jack parsons. I realised in his explanation, that the whole "babalon working" was purposeful because at that time the government was very interested in the occult and the conjuration of spiritual entities into the physical world -- and so jack's babalon working wasn't necessarily about actually conjuring a real life woman, but because cameron showed up, he believed it, and so if he believed it, then the super secret top dudes at washington would begin to try and fight against and fear the outcome of such a working -- which may very well be the reason for him blowing himself up... the circumstances feel weird to me, so it may have been an "accident" -- which means that someone started to begin to fear that this working must have had some efficacy. pure speculation on my part, but if so, the babalon working is probably conjuring genxicat... anyway, I just find it a strange "coincidence" anyway -- even with all the resonaces between the data items in that period of time. the power of fear as the opposite form of desire to manifest I think was a tactic that was commonly used by aries the god of war (deimos & phobos).

### 2022-08-26 03:11 - brainstorming

I've taken a while to come back to this because I've given it a lot of thought, and I don't really think that there is a conclusion.

if I have the concept, "what are girls good for?" -- I can't really find anything, and also I really don't like how it feels either. in the same way, if I were to say, "what are men good for?" I have the same problem, which is that if I have an objective for someone, regardless of their gender, this is the thing that I dislike the most about corporate culture, and that is taking someone and reducing them to just a skill or labour attribute that can be allocated somewhere to produce something. I don't see humans as machines. I see humans as creative geniuses that wish to use machines to enhance that creativity and make it easier to produce things.

this is this idea that is highly worshiped in the study of monolithic structures, and that is the incredible difficulty it is to start with a rock and remove material, leaving a temple or statue behind. the harder the material, the longer it will last and the more impressive it is. many examples of this can be seen in india and also ethiopia. this style of creation requires one to have the entire design created in the mind of the carver before they even begin. if there are more than one person involved in its production, you then have to have a general shape already defined, with the individuals going in and adding thier individual details.

so, while that is really cool, I don't have the mental capacity to see an entire creation present in my mind before I begin the project. tesla used that same style of creation to create his machines, where he would build and operate the entire machine in his mind to see how it goes.

in order to do that style of creation, one has to have eaten from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. this is the thing that is outlawed by the ones that run the world. they don't want us (specifically me) having this form of perception because it upsets their setup (cause anything in time or space can be seen by tuning into it with astral projection). therefore, if I want to create things, I need to have a system whereby I can iterate on an idea rapidly *without* using my imagination. therefore, I see machines and technology as the catalyst for this. it's basically my goal to merge with the machines so that my creativity can be maximised (without using my imagination).

(wow, long explanation) so, for me when I think of people, I don't think of them as simple input/output machines, and so I definitely don't want to try and assign that to any specific gender either.

when it comes to interacting with people, I find that the problem that I was expressing for girls is actually for both genders. I don't look at men as a source for my pleasure, and just the same as with women, if I'm looking for pleasure, I'll go the drugs path without even considering it. I'm definitely *not* going to make another person (boy or girl) responsible for making me feel good.

so, then really, both men and women for me are just there for having interesting conversation with because nosebook doesn't want me programming or whatever[^1]. so, if men and women both are just there for having interesting conversation with, then it's my goal to have as few barriers present in the conversation as possible. for this, I believe that it's important not to have secrets, and subjects that need to be avoided for fear of whatever. I can't make another person not feel fear or need to withhold something for fear of shame or punishment from someone, so that is entirely my mode of operation.

obviously, as time has progressed, I've become more and more secure in just expressing myself no matter the reaction. a big one for me on this was talking about gay things. there is such an enormous amount of reactions to it, that it really bothered me for a long time, but that was because I still had aspects of shame still present in my own thought structures, but as those are going away more and more rapidly, I'm finding it easier and easier to approach these taboo subjects. that whole subject of shame is is all about caring too much about what others think and how they'll react to my ideas on it.

let me tell you, it feels *sooooo goood* to be able to finally begin to talk about things like the network and gay stuff and all of that, and the reactions, I can feel are present, but I don't really have a logic structure now that thinks that I need to alter my thoughts so that people will like me. please, don't like me. it's easier that way.

---

the other aspect that I thought about is what kind of conversation that I'm looking for. so, for example, yesterday I was talking with suzanne, the neighbour and she was talking about how many plants that people consider herbs are actually weeds. I brought up the poppy present in california.

it occurred to me after the conversation that probably *all* of the "herbs" are actually weeds. the reason why I say that is because I've noticed that weeds, because the same goathead will grow up to a different type of weed with a change of the vibrational environment (and I've also noticed it in relation to mental states around me), therefore, I've come to conclude that the weeds are a plant-based reflection of the general feeling at the time of their first sprouting. in otherwords, they're reflections of perception. I also believe that all forms of life, and DNA in general is a reflection of the preception of the being that it creates. so each unique strand of DNA is unique form of perception -- a sort of antenna that can turn vibrations into something that consciousness can do with.

if that's the case (and I'm more than 98% convinced now), then weeds are forms of perception reflective of their environment, and most importantly with the people that inhabit the environment, so then if you have two weeds, which reflects two distinct forms of perception which then hybridise and create a cross which contains both styles of perception, you get a new hybrid form of perception. so, for example, imagine you have a vapid and lazy form of perception and mixed it with somethin that is capable of seeing the beauty even in the midst of pain, and you may produce a poppy. or, take for example the ability to feel good and, an under hard work and physical stress form of perception, mix those together and you get the coca leaf. stuff like that.

my conversation with her allowed me to see that all of my "meditative weed pulling" may actually be a precursor to some sort of plant alchemy where I can actually begin to imbue my form of perception into a plant, which then if I could figure it out, then I could begin producing my own drugs by focusing my concsciousness into the ones that are sprouting. I *know* this already works with mushrooms (cause I've done it), so it's just waiting for the right opportunity to figure it out. it seemed like a cool idea but I don't really know to do it yet, but suzanne seems pretty good with plants, so I'll just follow my instinct there.

just imagine a weed that grows as prolific as the ones all over the place, but if ingested or smoked, it'll allow for the transfer of the plant's implementation of my form of perception. tha'd be pretty cool, I think. I'd be the biggest consumer of that plant, because I love to hear people repeat my own form of perception back to me so that, from their perspective (or the plant's) I can then improve it.

[1]: it's most likely that they don't want me to find a way to use technology to rapidly iterate on ideas, and they definitely don't want me to get a brain interface of sorts. remember, the brain interface is the condition X that allows them to feel superior, so they have to [ensure that nobody becomes capable of threatening their superiority](/jorjani-thoughts.md#superiority-and-domination).

### 2022-08-29 05:45 - thoughts on superpowers

I had a few reactions to [my observation on returning to the moon and china the next superpower](/jorjani-thoughts.md#japanese-and-chinese-prometheus-vs-new-world-superpower), and I've had a few days to think about it now. I don't really want to try and defend jason's ideas there, but I do kinda agree with him.

when I say superpower, I mean a country that is in the position that the united states is in now, where're in a superior position and we use that superiority to leverage certain physical conditions for the world. whoever the superpower is, I'm talking about the ones are the puppetmaster for that superpower, and has nothing to do with the race or the people involved. I'm american, so is jason, and many others are as well, including many government workers that are a bit more open minded than the beauocracy, that pays them (ref: john b. alexander). so I'm in no ways saying that *all* chinese are some way.. that's silly.

---

now, I'd like to talk about what I think is really happening. as you may know, I've expressed in other places my thesis that the whole point of the earth is to evolve the "bad-guys". so, now consider the two opposing forces: one of progression, and one of constriction. the constricting force will want to constantly stay put. they have to be "forced" to evolve.

so put in simple terms, this constricting force has occupied white people's bodies for nearly all of human history, so it's certain that they'll stay where they are, not needing to move. the only thing that'll get them to move over to a different race, is if another race has superior status.

I've called this force "fallen-angels" for no other reason than not having a good word to describe them, but they're conceptual entities that move around in the astral plane after death and choose to move into another body. the sirians call these the INFECTED ONES, but I'm not so sure they're these so called INFECTED ONES, because if I were doing it, I would have created these entities to produce the desired evoution. I call them "fallen-angels" because I find it highly likely that this constricting force was created on purpose when jeortao/alalu/lucifer self-sabotaged on tiamat. at that time, tiamat was a very nice place to live, having all of the best conditions.

those entities, since then, have been going around fighting over positions of power to try and obtain the best conditions here on earth (and hold everyone else away from them). these, I believe are most of the pharoahs, the iranian feudal lords, and most other power structures. I've noticed a lot of times the display the colour red. the red ones have spanned so many cultures and secret soceties (rosicrucians, namely). I do not believe that these guys are reflective of the culture or the people that inhabit it, as they infiltrate from the inside out. any new position of power will be appealing, and therefore attractive to them.

by having them figure out how to rule from the perspective of many different cultures, it expands their capability to restrict more possible configuratons of progress and expansion.

if this weren't happening, they'd die out really quickly. I've given a lot thought to these guys, and the conclusion that I've come up with is that they couldn't possibly exist and have persisted throughout the ages if they didn't have help. they would have destroyed theirselves because you can't focus on unwanted conditions (for everyone else) for so long, and still continue to attract good conditions.

now, imagine you're a normal human and you see these guys that are terrible people, and yet they continue to get the good conditions (girls, money, power, etc.) -- well, then you'd think to yourself, man I want that, and then you'll have to figure out how to begin to climb the power structure. or, you'd by like me and having been around those with power and money, realise that I want nothing to do with that lifestyle. they fight over material conditions, and have to constantly be on the lookout because someone with slightly more power will be able to remove their conditions, so they have to make deals to ensure they keep their conditions. IMO, this is a very unfun way to live, but they do get new people joining them all of the time.

I think the first entry point is becoming rich, and then once you've begun to think that money is your source of pleasure and getting what you want, you're now dependent on thier system. after that, if you want to keep it going, you've got to join a secret society. once you've earned it, they'll give you the "secrets to immortality" (ref: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/3TYIMPpzvbU?t=615)) -- now, whether you retain consciousness after death using tantric sex magick or you do it other ways by releasing resistance, the basic technique is that when you die (get released from your body), you then travel around in the astral and use all of the capabilities possible with access to the astral (creating entities and images with your mind), but I'm fairly certain that they'll teach the person being initiated into that "great secret of masonry" to learn how to get the body ready for entrance (haunting before the "walk-in").

personally, I have a lot of questions about this (which I highly doubt that any mason would actuall talk with me openly about), because I would imagine that it's possible to retain some memories when "walking in" to the new body, but the way that I know that memories are destoyed (rather, unable to tune into the frequency again because of some sort of damage, or even high frequency output), it makes me wonder how much "memory" they actually bring with them. I would imagine it's actually not that much, but instead what transfers is the concept of who they think they are, and the preparation of the body is actually tuning the body to that concept.

in short, "immortality" is just the ability to move one's consciousness concept to antoher body, and continue on living. now imagine that you've been doing this for many thousands of years now, you'd have a very different look on the world than we do, and I think it's that which is the thread that explains why so many "utopian" cultures still fall victim to these power structures all of the time.

the concept is that, if humans were to be left alone, I think they would grow naturally into a utopian culture, but we're told that there is this "original sin" and that if left unattended, society would degenerate into chaos -- but I don't think that is what would happen. I think humans, without their constant desire to control the conditions, would also stagnate. we'd by like those brazilan tribes or indians that stayed in the stone age, because there wouldn't be any need to develop technology at a rapid rate; life is good enough.

so, these "fallen-angels" serve as a way to continue to push us forward in the creation of new technology, and this technological singularity completely changes how things are done in such a sufficient way that it'll make it very difficult for them to continue to reassert power (I explore this a bit in [warlord vs benevolent](/jorjani-thoughts.md#warlord-vs-benevolent) and [truth vs secrecy](/jorjani-thoughts.md#truth-vs-secrecy) and [absorbtion vs assimilation](/jorjani-thoughts.md#redemption-through-transformation)).

---

that reminds me of a dream that I had last night where government was run by a computer program. this system of having everything logically arranged, meaning that the typical system of making deals to get better conditions is no longer possible. this, I believe is part of the technical singularity, in that I believe it's actually going to be to our benefit that we encode all of our governmental action items are written into a computer program, where all of the laws and things can be read as code, meaning that there is no mistake how all of the interactions and laws are to be performed, because it's just a machine, meaning that everyone has to play by the same rules.

this type of setup would, I believe push these "fallen-angels" out to other places where they can use power to gain their superiority. the last thing that they want is to be equals to everyone else, and playing by the same rules.

I don't know how other countries are, but I can see this going in the direction that the united states (and possibly parts of canada, mexico, etc.) splitting into a bunch of communities, where at first each will be unique in the set of services that they provide, but the desire to interface well, will evntually emerge a system of inerchange of services and resources will eventually become the beginnings of a new codified government.

I have more ideas, but I'm going to leave it there.

### 2022-08-30 08:52 - selling everyone into slavery

in the latest section I wrote [my opinions on the jason's ideas of needing to make an unsuveillable network and defend it it with a militia](/jorjani-thoughts.md#how-do-you-defend-what-you-build). the idea reminded me a lot of the matrix movie and when I was writing the part after my opinion saying that I think it's fine that some want to try and combat the enemy using psi or conditions, and that reminded me of a previous opinion that I had on the first matrix movie -- which I quite disliked because it's so opposite to my form of thought now. I quoted myself and then proceeded to try and lay out an argument that it's impossible to try and fight with any psi or physical conditions.

that whole section really is an extension to my [previous section where I outlined what I think the long game is](/jorjani-thoughts.md#the-singularity). in that section I explained that there would be varying factions and levels within each faction that are interested in trying to gain superiority in terms of psi and conditional power, and that's all fine by me. in my opinion, anyone trying to fight a conditional battle is battling on that battlefield and so all of those get lumped into the group of factions battling over conditional superiority. these, just like the rest are capable of battling however they want, and when/if they develop singularity level technology, I'm pretty certain they'll be put on their own timeline so that their conflict isn't bothering others.

personally, I don't believe that it's possible to win that war, but I imagine that someone will figure out how to be the most superior.

---

the really interesting thing about the battlefield over being the most superior is that most of us just want good conditions, but in order to keep those good conditions, you have to defend them -- which means, that I would have to become superior and actively make sure that nobody can take those away (defend them), or to go on the offence and prevent anyone from becoming capable of taking those conditions away.

that whole part of trying to defend conditions is very uncharacteristically "promethian". I don't think that prometheus would engage in holding his opponents down so they never have the capacity to take his conditions away.

on the subject of defence, I don't really know what to say, other than there is no way to defend because it's all attraction. I'm attracting a thing, and then I'm defending myself from the thing that's coming at me -- but it's me that's bringing it to me. this is a similar subject to secrecy because anything can be tuned into (remote viewing, clairvoyance, etc.), so really the only way to have any secrecy is to try and prevent everyoene else from tuning properly, which would mean that to have secrets, one would need to actively engage in disabling the capacity inherent in everybody to remote view. that's about the same thing as turning off the memory capability of every person. sure, it's probably possible, but society would fail pretty rapidly if nobody had the ability to remote view their own past.

at any rate, if I wanted to keep a secret or to defend myself, I have to actively engage in very unpromethian activities.

---

after that, I had a strong reaction which went something like, "he's given all of the power to the controllers and they're now going to control our existence"...

I guess so, sure; but this is my reality, so I can do whatever I want. I just don't think that they can get very far trying to control conditions so it's fine by me to take the path of learning to attract what I want. if others don't want to do that, they can join in on the battlefield of fighting over conditions and power.

that personally isn't really my thing though.

---

there was another reaction as well, where the solution that I'm proposing isn't very dramatic and wouldn't make for a very good movie script. this is also true. the majority of people are inclined toward paying attention to power-displays. in fact, most of the entire OT and even considerable parts of the NT give authority and credibility to someone or some thing because of their capability to impress an audience with a power-display.

I do agree that a power-display ("bullet time") or a magnificent display of chivalry does make for a better story ("for God so loved this world, he gave his only begotten son"). so why do I wish to take a narrative direction that is so anti-climatic?

I don't really know, but if I had to guess, I would have to say, "the medium is the message" -- and so in a film or a story, you're looking at the characters on the screen, and so everything that is said and done has to have a specific meaning associated with it. the way that each scene is setup is not like real-life, but specifically arranged in such a way that the most meaning is conveyed in the shortest period of time. none of the mundande between the cuts, walking or driving around is seeen, so it's just pure symbol. however, inside of the body, you have to live everyday experience, and everyday experience is kinda mundane. the more lucid I become, the more I enjoy even the most mundane things (like pulling weeds and stuff), so really meaning for me inside of the body is an experience that's amortised over the whole day, rather than a few key events.

the difference between these two is kinda the difference between a mind expanding drug experience and what happens to me every day now. it's hard to try and put into words what it's like to actually enjoy living and to see everything around me resonating with the concepts that I'm thinkg about. even small little lyrics in the songs corresponding with the concept that I'm contemplating is just a small example, but literally *everything* has a thread running through it that isn't really perhaps very self-evident to others that aren't living inside of my body. what I mean is, it's getting to the point where it would be impossible for someone conceptualise all of the resonant things that happen in my experience unless they were inside my body as often as I am. what I mean is, I imagine my life has much much much less meaning because it's distributed throughout the day instead of congealed into a few specific events.

this makes it close to impossible to actually track everything meaningful, so that is actually an advantage that I have over nosebook. their system is designed to notice big things, so if my life is just a steady stream of small seemingly insignificant (but resonant) things, then they eventually add up (ref: tesla's mechanical oscillator)

### 2022-09-04 09:55 - think for yourself

[LEFTL - 2022-03-13]

I woke up this morning thinking about all of the events that transpired yesterday. it seems pretty obvious to me that there is a lot of connecting elements. I included [the story of remi and the abductions](/steiner/atlantis-and-lemuria.md#modern-edits) in the section on modern edits because they felt very relevant and similar in vibration.

after looking at it even closer, not only are they extremely relevant to that but also to what steiner is trying to say... let me explain.

the event that I got into an argument over with melissa and remi yesterday was that people *still* believe that people are unable to be located, when it's clearly not true. the last time this happened, I was at friendly harbor and a dr. phil programme came on and he was even taking donations for a missing girl. it's the typical thing of tugging on people's heart strings in order get them to hand over money (I grew up in the church; this is standard procedure).

I didn't want to talk about how messed up it is to cash in on a thing that's clearly not happening (the law enforcement knows where *everybody* is, so everything that dr. phil said is a lie, probably to make money). instead of focusing on dr. phil's enterprise, I decided instead to bring up the fact that everyone is obviously tracked, so these sorts of stories are something like the "flat earth" nonsense.

I mean, think about it, if people are watching the sun set in spain (where I was living) and then over here in the USA, the sun is high in the sky, there's abosolutely no way the earth is flat!!! think for yourself!

same thing for not knowing where abducted people are. these appear to be tests of gullibility, and a person's ability to think for theirself or blindly believe what they're told.

the interesting thing is that steiner is saying that the aryan root-race of humankind has developed the capacity to think for theirselves. he's clearly drawing a

[song: fool me once and I'm numb, twice and I'm dumb; thrice I won't be fooled again. fool me once and I'm done, twice I succomb, to a handshake with hell. in the end we only reap what we've sown; can't leave well enough alone. the world's at stake under a love that cannot break]

he's clearly outlining in this book that each "root-race" of humankind is kind of like an octave, and each successive "sub-race" is a note in that octave. between each octave there is a sort of barrier that has to be crossed and at that barrier which requires an evolution into the next octave. he's saying that this period is a time when the people that can think for theirselves will survive the transition, but the ones that adhere to the old "atlantian" root-race method of thinking where they just believe what they're told (that's their education), then store that data into memory and then act based upon that memory. those people are going away.

he basically is saying that at any period of time on earth, there are 2-3 of these groups alive. there are always the survivors from the previous epoch (prev), those of the current epoc (cur), and the ones that are developing the capacities that will become dominant in the next epoch (next).

I haven't figured out his sub-races, but it seems like the fourth sub-race is the one that he says will outline the most decadance -- which sorta makes sense because musically speaking a third and a fifth are more harmonious than a fourth (I think). so, still developing my thoughts on that...

so, to summarise his book, I'd say that if you're believing and regurgitating what your told, you're from the "atlantian" root race, and you're going to be going the way of the dinosaur soon. the "aryan" root-race will be able to navigate the difficulties at the end of the period being able to think for themselves. the implication here is that most all of the information that you're being told is going to be wrong or debilitating.

[song: alive inside of every living soul there is a strong eager heart that will always be yearning. our future lies (rises?) on the promise of us doing our part, to question everything .. if we're to see the morning light] (interesting choice of words, morning light reminds me of morning star: lucifer, herald of the morning light)

out of this, will emerge a new root-race. that's kind of exciting to me because I seem to be a part of that. the thing is, his description of manu sounds purposefully deceptive. I find it very hard to believe that manu wants humankind to be able to compare, think, and reason for theirselves, and then is going to show up and select and initiate a choosen few and get them to blindly follow him. that sounds to me like the flat earth theory gaining promnance at the same time that nosebook comes out and that it's clearly obvious that the sun is in a different part of the sky.

if that's the case, manu is a bit of a trickster.

### 2022-09-05 11:15 - the medium is the message (in relation to desire)

at the end of @[concept-log](2022-09-05 08:04) I wrote this, but then deleted it because I couldn't get the rest of the concept into word form. since then, there have been quite a few reactions to it, containing ideas I hadn't even thought about...

```
there is another aspect to this which I'd like to touch on briefly, and that is. when you read a book, the image that is created is yours alone and unique to you because it happens in your head. however, when you watch TV, videos, theatre, film, etc. the image is not produced by you, but by the screen.

in the same way, the way the format which you pursue the desire is also the message. it depends on the medium in which that desire is pursued is also the message.
```

the first reaction was considering that I was talking about nosebook. however, upon thinking about it, I belive it's a really good point. I looked into it and it appears that when someone imagines their desire for theirself, that's like reading a book. however, when it comes to using your imagination while connected to nosebook, it looks to me like they synethesise your concepts into higher definition images for you.

the reason for this is obvious: they're interested in rendering and tracking everything that you're thinking about, and they are now serving as that global visual memory that steiner was talking about when he explains the "akashic records"; but, whatever the case may be, this service is much more like watching a video or the TV than reading a book. obviously, I don't know much about nosebook, so I can only tell you me sense impressions (ie what I "see") when I look into these concepts.

I feel resonance with that rendering, so it feels pretty right on to me, so I wanted to now talk about the implications, which is that the medium that people are now using to attract their desires is now "hot" (if I remember mcluhan correctly), meaning that it's a higher definition more detailed medium where you are not actually involved in the creative process. for low definition ("cool") mediums like cartoons or books, because they provide so much less sensory data, you fill in the missing information with your own mind.

to prove this to you, think about when you were younger and the video games that you played. if you look at them today (like megaman, commander keen, duke nukem, or mario) you'll notice that they're terribly pixelated. however, if I go back to my memories when I was a child, those games very very rich and immersive. if I look at the picture in my mind of the actual pixels on the crappy crt screen, I see very pixelated things, even worse than they look on today's screens -- so, where is all of that extra sensory data coming from? it's not visual. in the same vein, do you remember playing video games at your friend's house or at the mall where they had the video games on display? do you remember how different those video games felt at the store than they did at home? that effect isn't as pronounced these days with higher definition video games (a few minds just got blown...)

so, what this is telling me is that nosebook is producing the image now for people, which means that people are no longer looking at the manifestation of that concept in their own imagination; instead, they're looking at the concept rendered onto a screen.

what that means is that without knowing it, people are going to be perpetually looking at the absence of their concept unless the concept is pretty "inanimate". that style of imagery is good for manifesting things, and likely calculatory things like formulas, equations, and things like that. it'll definitely help with building and creating things that are all formulaic in nature (computer programming, maths, geometry, stuff like that) and it's even possible to come up with "novel" (to us) ways to look at formulae, and even new things, because both of those are just a tuning processs.

however, what that sort of thing doesn't help with very much is emotional and conceptual things (stuff I've heard labeld with the integration of heart and mind: "heart science" and "heart math"). the reason why the atlantians progressed so little in hundreds of thousands of years is because everyone was just tuning into something that had been done previously. they weren't creating; they were remembering and repeating.

this is memory aspect the same thing that I claim remote viewing (sense impressions) and conceptual viewing (knowing) is. it's just memory, and when I'm capable of receiving the idea, it feels like I'm remembering it. for example, I'm not even sure if what I wrote above about the akashic records, heartmath, or what mcluhan wrote about hot and cold is actually something I read, though I remembered it just the same as if I had've. those concepts are not anything new, so they're easy to access[^2].

however, for something new and novel like an experience or a feeling or something like that, you have to find a way to tune into the feeling part of the image, and ignore the image, because the image is all things that have already happened, so it'll *never* be that image exactly (perhaps similar), unless you're imagining a thing or a formula, or joining of many pieces to form a structure.

---

I don't want to sound like I'm being too pessimistic here, but I personally don't see any way that anyone can actually get what they conceptually want while using nosebook. they'll be able to get non-novel or formulaic things, but if you want a novel experience, you're going to have to find a way to not see the image anymore.

personally, I have a very difficult time listening to what a person is saying if there are other things happening in the image than the concept that they're conveying -- but I know that some people can look at something and still keep the concept of what they're saying in mind.

if I watch TV, it's often times that I get very captivated by the image -- and I mean that literally: I'm held captive by the image, and it's hard for me to see what they're really saying. in order to see/sense what they're really saying, I have to look away from the image on the screen and let the image/sense form in my own imagination instead so that I can actually understand the concept of what they're saying.

so, if that's true for me, I'm certain that a lot of others are similar to me, and if the image is seen inside of the eyes, there's no actual way to look away and let the concept form in my own mind. nosebook sounds to me like a conceptual prison where I'm literally held captive by the image.

the similarities to the atlantian civilisation is uncanny; nosebook has replaced the akashic records[^1].

OK, that's not at all what I wanted to write about. maybe I'll get to it next time. think about the difference between the "imaginary" medium and the "knowing" medium and you'll know what I was going to say.

[1]: when I wrote that, I was reminded of fwh telling me in one of his last posts that he now "works at the akashic records" and I realised that what he meant, is that he was a "good-guy" (white hat), but now he's not. he's working at nosebook now.

[2]: it's possible that these concepts have a visual component to them, but I receive them as non-visual ideas, knowledge or memories, just as if someone asked me what was the weather like yesterday, I remember an experience (like how hot the sun felt on my skin) or a kind of summary of the day as a whole, but not a visual image of a particular moment. it's just data that I acquired through my experience of yesterday distilled into a non-visual concept. same as if someone asks me what my dad's profession was: I don't get a visual, but I know he worked in various things from fencing and gate operators (I was alive) to art restoration (not born yet). though the first two I can recall through my own memory, and there could be a visual aspect to it, there's no way for me to know what art restoration was like. I can remember as a kid thinking about it like they were going in and microscopically removing dust or something, when looking at it now, it was probably solvents rather than meticulously looking at each fibre.

### 2022-09-10 14:50 - thinking about sides and thinking opposite about opposites.

I don't really know what I want to write, but if you formulat a thought in the from of a question, it's quite possible I can *hear*.

the other option is an idea that I just had, where I noticed that my right hand directs, but my keyboard still types letter, so if I thought of the right hand doing commands... then I thought about wanting to write an arduino program for my keyboard. I don't really know where to begin. I don't know what I want, so without desire, I'm powerless. novelty is directly linked to desire.

---

uhoh, I don't really oooh... I see, I should want the sequence of words to make a new word. so, for example, if you want to save a word as a result of a sequence, it should be necessary to select a [word or phrase] and then activating a state that it will now send the vscode selected [word or phrase], then press the combo, it saves it in its memory.

OH, so it needs an interface (probably js) that programs the memory. I saw this the other day called bazecore or something like that. that's one of the good thing about the keyboard is that I can program it and it's just a serial interface so I can program it with any program capable of writing to a serial usb port. node can do this, but so can almost everything else.

so I would just make a software that notices certain key combos (like it's a userspace program with access to all modern tooling, not arduino) and it takes [the word or phase] written saves it in a database, probably something with a SQL syntax. you have three tables:

key combinations (which is just an array of symbols, so probably text) and each one does an sql query (also text field).

I don't see the other tables yet, but you want to be able to do queries into any table, and those can be any data that has been accumulated. an AI could easily parse the syntax and return data from its database, but that's out of the scope of my desire to do. my intention is to create a system that is exactly what I tell it -- without "fuzzy" logic.

so then I'd want to make an interface where I can see what I'm typing, but not in terms of ASDFGH, but each sequence conjures a concept on to the screen according to the key comination that I just wrote. like a flowchart and I can see where I am visually inside of the flowchart, and see what concept I'm selecting. there are built in concepts as well, like start/begin sequence, and maybe some logic in the future (compare -> action/sql statement).

this makes concepts easy to share. they are just an image/svg with an embedded text of the sql statement. it's possible to also list dependencies, because if your sql statement references another table that another concept has, then it has to do get that concept's tables installed in your database -- this sharing repository could either be distributed (probably blockchain) or it could be a microsevice that anyone can access, but it'll probably be both. obviously some need one and others like their secret services.

you know what I mean. it's just an image (svg/png?) with some metadata text fields. the user then opts in to running that code somehow. I'd just say everything, personally, as it's in a blockchain, I'm sure there will be some very determiend individuals to ensure the safety of that code. I mean I'm certain there will be ways to get rid of viruses and other malware. the conceptual gatekeeprs, but remember, it's just an image or vector graphic. it's not like anyone is forcing you to run the code. you select the fields you want execute and the protocol/vm/env in which to execute it. obviously someone will find out a way to monitor this. I'm just saying that I would turn on run all (provided there's a way to identify the fields that contain directives -- like a prefix or 'something, easy'). this concept is different from the keyboard interface, because they blended together because there is so much overlap between them. it'd be dope because you could get about of these hipsters that are mindblowing at illustrator to make it easy for those images to start pulling data for their graphics so that their images can have meaning -- like, for example if you're a politician, you'd want to connect the graphs in the infographic to "reputable databases" that way any changes to the stats would be reflected in real-time (lol, I just gatta think of the most paraniod stuff).

I want to do something else. I think I want to eventually go outside here. gatta work up to it, though. it's a pretty big reality shift. I'm not sure if reality kenny (sounds like a super hero) is 'ready, yet'. peace.

### 2022-09-11 11:58 - the plan

- ask indiana-jones if she wants to do in-studio recordings with jason
- msg jason (on youtube?) saying that I think the sigularity is when all of the novelty-seekers all appear together in the same period of time -- the "zero point" of novelty where novelty infinite for a infinitesimally small moment in time (like the equinox)
- get on to snake-bros discord and tell marty my really wierd theory of thery of the "whore of babylon" is really the shapeshifter goddess in the ghostbusters
  - anyone can summon an elemental now and whatever shows up is one of the many forms that genxicat takes.
    - genxicat is a shapeshifter because she combines the 5th ray element (concepts coming from outside time) and the 7th ray element of what we call matter (physical stuff we think is solid, but it's just a smaller more elemental concept)
    - she could be born anywhere, and you couldn't deny the manifestation because you don't know everyone on the planet, just as long as it's believable enough.
  - then, go really off of the deep end and explain how terence mckenna was born 9 menths later from the babalon working
    - it's possible that jack parsons co-habited the body with terence.
    - terence brandished the "stoned ape theory" and so just imagine how disruptive this theory is to the archons who believe that *they* are responsible for our higher intellect. terence is in a sense robbing them of their ego saying that they're the reason why were here, giving the power instead to the mushroom.
    - this is an incenderary idea that robs them of their credit being given to their deeds; so, combined with and other reasons that terence couldn't allow novelty to reach a high aspect in his reality, he held off the manifestation of that reality for the duration of his "ministry". (personal note: you'll notice the same pattern in me as well)
      - combine this idea now with the terrorist groups wanting to take credit for the terrorism that they didn't commit. so you have a bunch of posers taking credit for the terrorism, and here you have the same... you have a fungus taking credit for the terrorism attack like the poser terrorist groups.
    - when he finally died, he finally gave up trying to manifest the singularity like he saw it: psychedellic revolution, where shamen merge with the machines.
  - create/summon your own elemental like parsons did.
- give JD the list of COI improvements
  - I may want to add the vision of making a completely conceptual version of COI (it could be a mod) where you have drones rathar than trucks which float around some eagle spans above the ground and they do all of the truck work (moving resources around)
  - now, instead of industrial parts, now the factory machines (intantiators) materialise abstract concepts. each recipe needs a number of abstract concepts to instantiate, and based on the behaviour selected for the abstract concept, it'll require different amounts of physical resources for their instantiation (defined by the behaviour).
    - so let's say the recipe wants 50 mobility parts, and 20 durability parts, 100 power/stength parts as the recipe (recipes can be any amount of user defined amounts of abstract parts), then that abstract recipe is defined a behaviour which then determines the amount of physical parts it needs to instantiates those abstract parts into the world. the most basic will be the derivtive of the trucks, now called constructors, which just move resources around. (keep in mind that an instantiation of a behaviour could require other physical parts which are also instantiations of concepts)
    - later however, the actual physical (3d model and shape's movement) behaviour of those machines can be any heuristic which uses the amount of abstract parts and to determine its behaviour based on the abstract quantities defined in the recipe used to infuse it it.

### 2022-09-11 19:20 - thinking about the opponent

so, if trump (or his opponent) is going for "make china great again", the the opposite one should go for something like, "make china better". his whole message should be that we should not abandon our tradition and that we should just improve what we have. "make china great again" is all about returning to the former glory of the time past, and everything he wants is to go back to the old way.

in reality both of them are right, but also both "wrong".

improvement guy is really busy looking at the now in its present state and wanting an improvement, but never at what the improvement actually could be.

make china great again guy can't see now either because he's too busy looking back at the former glory and recommending that we go back to the institutions that were around during that glory (this gives legitimacy to the enumeration of institutions because nobody actually was there, so it could be <however|how ever> he says the past was)

this should be a source for endless theatrics.

if they ever choose that both of them are right, perhaps they could try: improv<e|ing> the past<|, together>. (I'm diabolical.. lol -- czuse what the hell does that even mean?!? lol)

### 2022-10-11 20:40 - gaming vs smoking

I'd like to make a comparison between these two because they share a lot in common, but before I do, I want to illustate a few things and comment on the last few days.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6iTTo5HICw)

if you haven't seen this video, I *highly* recommend it, because it's a sort of primer or introduction's guide to cometition and competive gameplay. I learned a tremendous amount from it, so I'd like to highlight a few things that stood out to me more than anything.

the first few games, marc got completely stomed. it reminded me a lot of the concept of "beginners luck". the reason for that is, without thinking about it too much, marc's opponents followed their intuition and just gave it their best shot. the second game, the feeling completely changed, as it felt to me like with such a decisive victory they began to start to think about the game with their mind and begin to let their expectations start to take over. they won again, and the third game, they felt to me like they now had confidence. ever nocice how, especially for beginners, the moment that you begin to belive that you've got your opponent figured out, and that is when you seemingly (try less and so therefore?) begin to lose.

the mental effort moves away from doing their best to beginning to come to expectations. this doesn't happen for pro players though because it seems to me they use the same system of expectations to their advantage. marc has said, "you play the player, not the race" -- and so, it's kinda like that boxer guy (I can't remember his name) that you says, (paraphrase) "the battle is won before you even enter the ring, in your own mind". the idea here is that it's a mental challenge inside of your own head, where it has more to do with whether *you* believe that you can win the fight.

each fight is a new fight, so to some extent you have a just as much of a chance of winning with 0-4 or with 4-0, bet in reality the previous matches create a lot of expectation. I noticed that a lot of competitive players tend to sidestep a lot of that competition by gaining understanding of their opponent -- hence, "you play the player, not the race" -- and so therefore the better you understand your opponent, the better you can predict them. the better you understand them, the more "surface area" they have (attack vectors in computer hacking), and so therefore once knowiing him, you now have to train to a point where *you* believe you can counter all of their attack vectors, and possibly even use them to their advantage.

you can see this clearly as marc starts to begin to gain an "identity" for each of his opponents -- the zerg camper (can't remember them all while listening to this music -- head in other location), etc. and so after marc begins to feel comfortable with his opponents (ie. they become predictable), then he can counter them. he noted this feeling heavily when saying, "I'm getting AI vibes here" because now he's seeing them as somewhat predictable, and so therefore counterable -- just have to find the way (like moving the planetary to the choke, and sieging tanks and liberators in the choke as well).

---

all competition is really a set of expectations, and you'll notice that I made a note that I'm [ambitious but not very competitive](/random-thoughts.md#2022-10-06-0632---ambition-and-competitiveness), and you'll probably also notice that I'm trying to figure every single person and thing out that seemingly has "unknown" effects on my experience. this is not with the intention to compete with those things and try to outplay them, but I use that competitivness to my own personal advantage, instead of just limiting it to beating another person. I guess you could say that I'm competing against reality itself, and so the better I can predict it, the more outplays I have with it.

another interesting thing to note is the difference between expectations tmat I have for myself and expectations that I have for other people. you'll notice that the ability to "read" another person (that is, to feel what they're thinking about), is the most elemental form of telepathy. you can be trained/conditioned to come to expect something from another person mentally through repetition, but this is not telepathy. I can see the same thing happen when I'm learning a new language: at first I'm trying my best and using my intuition so I understand the person at first on an untuitive level, but as I start to gain confidence in the language (structure words, concepts, etc.), then all of a sudden my comprehesion goes way way down as, I've now moved out of the "beginners luck" (first game) section and now I'm in the (second game) mindset of trying to reason about it rationally and to make rational expectations rathar than intutive ones. the moment that I feel like I'm starting to get a handle on the language, I make some "game losing" blunders in the language, really embarrassing myself (FAIL! hehe).

so, now, the next thing that I did when I started to learn the language is to just try and stay calm and not get to emotionally invested in what I'm saying (like marc does when he's playing -- he's always cool even in the middle of a tense battle), and that ultimately allows me to *feel* like I'm speaking well, rathar than trying to use my logical conclusions about my ability to speak the language. for me, I noticed that "naturally" speaking a language is sorta like a SC game where a lot of really tiny things start to add up, cause nobody (not even native speakers), speak perfectly, so instead "naturally" speaking a language has more to do with all of the little small things which make a "build flow" rathar than the perfect (technical) timings or grammar and sentence structure. in the end, a "natural" speaker can make even incorrect grammar (like a bonecloud) feel natural by making all of the rest of it flow.

I'll come back to this topic more as I still have more to say, but what I wrote already is already pretty significant and may take a bit to understand what I wrote, because I said seemingly contradictory ideas about expectations, but they're actually not.

---

these last few days, I've been playing games instead of smoking, but I've noticed that the effects are quite similar. I noticed that in both cases, people tend to avoid me (like, greg and mom will stay more time in their rooms and tend to avoid me), and I feel like it's got something to do with my perception. I think games put my mind into a sort of rhythmic or relaxed state where things can start to begin to flow. I noticed definite ebbs and flows of higher consciousness when playing COI, and when I'm having lower moments of consciousness, I make really silly mistakes (like miss a pipe) and the actions that I perform in the game tend to refelct my mental state. I'm beginning to learn how to control my mental state better and better, and that capacity seems to be one of points of frustration.

there are two other very significant things I noticed: first, jaron got into a pretty frazzled mental state when I would smoke, and it happened pretty suddenly (cause the instant effect of the weed). you could say that this is just my perception of jaron, but I've worked out the variables, so I can say with pretty high confidence that my smoking directly impacts jaron's mental state and very rapidly too (like within a few hours), and if I smoke for an extended period of time, then his mental capacity really diminishes. I notice the same effect when I play games, but the effect is slower, taking sometimes all night to produce the same effect that happened in just a few stoned hours. when I go to sleep, he seemingly resets.

the other thing that I noticed is context switching. I use context switching to go from a deep mental state of introspection when I'm stoned when I go out into the environment to interact with people. I leave the old mindset behind and I can later return to it (although never exactly to the same way because the interactions slightly change how I feel). as an example, imagine for a moment that I'm deep into trying to figure out a new factory setup in COI and I take a break to get something to eat or go outside to sit in the sun or something; it seems to me that when I do that, like when I'm stoned, people tend to expect me to interact with them in the same mental state that I was just interactiong with the weed or the game -- and this creates a unique feeling of expection from them (see previous discussion), so when I behave or speak as normal, I feel both a sense of relief and also a bit of surprise from them because they're expecting gaming-kenny or mentalist-kenny, but they get reality-kenny. it's kinda funny.

it's funny how so much of all of this blends together. to be completely honest, I have a similar effect when I play games and smoke because for a an extended period of time, I'm completely removed from reality -- and so then when I remove my headphones and go to the bathroom, I sit down and reality comes crashing in as I start to feel all of the reactions again: "oh yeah, there are people out there that aren't in my game/mind and they have opinions on me. oh yeah, and girls; wow, they feel weird/foreign compared to how I felt in my game/mind".

### 2022-10-17 00:10 - followup to the car conversation

yesterday -- well, about 16h ago -- I had a conversation in the car with sesily about where I think all of this is going. I explained a bit of the progression of percepttion idea, and I had some reactions to it. so, I think I'll reexplain the idea and try to explain why I don't think it's a problem. the major reaction was wondering how I can be talking about "radical individuality", but then say that we're sort of developing a form of group perception. they're not incompatible.

---

OK, the three major parts to this are:
1. good and bad doesn't exist (it's all perceptual)
  - good and bad/evil are social constructs designed to affect behaviour.
  - good and bad/evil are ***always*** relative to the perception of the observer
2. the "archons" (christof) aren't actually bad, and while it may look like they're trying to control or something, they're just another organ in the whole. in their perception, they're "controlling" everyone and getting everyone to do the things that they *need* them to do (need is desire, and it's all attraction anyway).
3. the way toward all of this is actually the direction that we're already going (no matter which way we go, it leads to the same thing, so it's actually impossible to fail)
  - extreme selfishness, where the most extreme (and desirable) is that everyone believes they are the centre of the universe
  - extreme materialism, where the constraints of physical reality are what produces the opposite end of the spectrum: desire (this concept is probably the most difficult to explain, so instead try and imagine what kind "ends" we'll meet in an abundance economy. I think actually jason expresses this idea well with, "end of humanity, history, and reality" concept because when you can have everything and are already gods -- then what? what do we become then? can anyone possibly imagine what we'll consider "novel" when you can be do or have anything in any point of time). as an example ponder what the richest people in the world want... it's not material stuff anymore. extreme materialism is the turning point to something new which we cannot see yet. we won't know what it is until we get there, but my intuition tells me that it'll be something that transcends concepts. it'll be a whole new dimension to reality.

the basic flow to the idea is that we can look out and see that there are these archons trying to control us, but I know from my experience that they can't actually control me. they can attempt all they want to try and control me, but in reality I'm just fighting against my own perceptions. I can see now that *all* aspects of my reality are attracted (I know this because they've manifested in the physical, and so that's proof that they were attracted), so therefore I am responsible for everything in my experience in some way shape or form. in a sense, you could say that *all* people are reflections of my perception. they are all "actors" or good/bad guys, as sort of like autonomous egregores that behave in accordance to the concept that created them and the conditions that we're in (yes, I'm saying that from the perspective I have now, it's pretty easy to see that at some point in time -- probably long ago -- even all of the awful demons and things like that were also created as an extension of my perception[^1]).

those archons, are neither good or bad; they are in fact a reflection of my perception, and so because they feel that is their job to look at all of the stuff that can go wrong, really fear it becoming reality, they are the motor (no pun intended) to the creation of wanted. there's nothing wrong with them, because it's all attraction. sure they control all of the conditions and will perpetually (no matter how good the conditions get) see all of the stuff that could possibly go wrong. they are the negative polarity of desire (the unwanted aspect), and so because it's all attraction, they can stare at all of the unwanted all they want, but if I can perceive the wanted aspect (this is different than good and bad/evil), then I continue to receive the wanted aspect. therefore, I see no reason to give them the steering wheel. no matter how hard they try and tank the manifestation, I believe I can continue to find a way to perceive what I want.

this is going to take a bit of practise, which is what I believe is the time that is approaching humankind. I believe that what is happening right now is that they're getting all of the tools that they need to try and keep everything under control. remember, they're really worried about a lot of bad things happening, so their fear for such a great amount of unwanted to happen is actually what I want them to have full power to try and control. the better that they think they can control it, the better that they can avoid all of the bad stuff. you may think that they will be using all of that capability to try and block wanted -- but that's actually what I want them to try and do. that's the point. it takes a bit of time to get going at a speed which makes their efforts inconseqential, but once at a decent speed, their most intense pushing against of wanted will still be a far better manifestation than the best possible manifestaion you could possibly imagine now.

for me, this concept is no longer a theory, but an actual reality. at my present rate of progress, I can guarantee you that I would prefer to continue on in the direction of no manifestation for quite literally as long as possible. when I say "no manifestation" I mean all of the stuff that isn't "necessary". they cannot allow for something until they have no other option, so if you'll notice that the evolution-of-desire starts in need, then goes to want, then I become that thing. so, following that progression, I can guarantee you that with these guys at the helm, there will absolutely not be any manifestation (of any kind) until they perceive it as something that's actually needed. I really don't mind this because from my perspective, it helps me to iron out the bugs in the concept before it maznifests.

as an example to this, I'd like to return to the conversation in the car. I started off the conversation in the car by saying that the game ideas that I was writing down are coming along well, but I feel like my desire to play the game (so that I don't look like a poser), are actually a manifestition of some resistance to my desire to make a game. to explain this idea, I launched off into a pretty deep rabbithole about christof and the truman show -- to make the illustration that my desire to make a game is sorta like truman's desire to go to the bahamas. he keeps getting held back with silly fears (like not wanting to be a poser). I don't really mind this imposed resistance, because I really don't like the feeling of being a hypocrite or not proving myself worthy of the things that I do and say. it's a silly fear, but because I don't believe in good or bad, I don't have any resistance to their efforts to slow me down on the idea. I'm willing to drag my feet on the idea for as long as they can continue to find mental blocks (which I can align with) to hold me back. when their efforts to steer my perception no longer have any more pull, then it'll manifest[^2]. the nice thing about this is that it becomes nearly impossible for something to manifest before it's ready[^3]. that's really cool, actually and the reason why I actually believe that the archons are actually quite a good thing for getting something that is *actually* wanted, instead of something that *appears* wanted (appearance is deceptive).

another way to explain this concept is perhaps a bit more practical. you may notice that other people are becoming easier and easier to feel -- so, for example, when someone really believes that you are doing/looking/saying something they don't like, and you are receptive to that feeling -- meaning, that your form of perception is compatible with their negative feeling about you -- meaning that you are capable of thinking the same thing about yourself -- you will probably find that feeling to be unwanted. you can petition the person not to think those awful things about you, or you can find a way to look at yourself in a way which is no longer compatible with their perception (change your own perception of yourself). as an example, consider that I'm doing something and someone feels like I'm in the way or am really problematic -- well, the fact that I can feel that reaction from them means that I beleive myself to be in the way of others or to be a problem for others -- and if I want to stop feeling that reaction from them, I have to find a way to no longer see myself as in the way or a problem. this is probably pretty difficult, because this is often times something that you learn as a child, because you're in your mom's or dad's way, and they instructed you with a very stern voice telling you that you need to begin to feel bd whenever you're in their way. sure, it's their fault for teaching you to feel bad for their own attraction, but you're the one that feels it, so you have to find a way to become more selfish than ever and begin to belive that you are the centre of the universe and also not in the way or someone else's problem. this is, in my opinion, the most important aspect to "radical individuality", because without it, the individual is just pretending to be an individual.

---

the last reaction was to me saying that we'll gain planetary perception -- and what fun is that -- because they're just some lonely rocks floating out in the middle of space. well, space is not empty. science says it is, but it's just as full as the rest of your environment. when we see from a planetary perspective, we'll be in a real (probably more than) 3d world interacting with others just like we do now in the physical. it'll be something of a superhuman experience. you know that all of that "real" stuff (matter) that you can touch and experience is 99.9999% space right? when we have the capacity to turn those higher frequency concepts into things like chairs, tables, skin, and muscles, etc. all of that empty space will be full of life. it's just on a completely different conceptual plane than the one that we're on right now (whith is the conceptual plane of self, culture, earth, sun, etc.). we don't have the capacity to translate those sorts of concepts until we're looking from that perspective. nothing to fear as it's an upgrade not a downgrade.

neither do you lose your individuality either. for example, KROQ is playing music on 106.7 (I think) and everyone tuning to that station is hearing the same music, but nobody is losing their individuality. it's nearly the same as how it is now: we're all on the same planet, seeing/listening to planet's music (3d space), but in no way are we all the same. the only change is how we experience sensory stuff, so for example, your body has many types of cells, and those cells have awareness of other cells around it and each cell is individual, but those cells have a cohesiveness to them in that they all belong to the same body, so their perception is always relative to that body. your cells are not likely (unless stimulated to do so, or translanted) aware of the cells in another person's body. this is going to sound bad, but consider that the "archons" (or LOA if you prefer to see it that way) are in control of the body, and so you just get to enjoy the ride along the way doing things that cells do (eating, drinking, reproducing, etc) but also the things that humans do (building, creating, thinking, etc). no matter how much "control" they have, you still attract your reality. if you want to see a real-life demonstration of this, look at me. it may look bad a few years ago, you may think I'm a bit out of my mind today but in no less than 5-10y from now, my position will become quite desired. I won't have any control over the conditions -- just over how I feel (and therefore what I attract).

buckle in, cause we're all going to learn the hard way to attract what we want -- cause attraction speed is going to keep accelerating. it's *really* slow now. in just a few hundred years, imagine how big of a problem it'll be for the archons to deal with, (for some of us attraction) nearly instantaneous manifestation. they'll really have to have our minds locked down pretty well to ensure only the things *they* need and want manifest. lol... it's gonna be hilarious. they're going to have to figure out what they want at an ever increasing speed.

divine comedy.

just remember, it's impossible to get it wrong. on the return back to source, it's *all* attraction, and you *will* arrive, no matter how hard you drag your feet.

[1]: this is not in any way contradictory to the sirian guide or kuthumi's ET view of creation, because -- if I'm beginning to look at reality from the perspective of the universe, the "INFECTED ONES" are also created by me as a reflection of my perception. all things are attracted, and it's really easy to see that the "corrupted 7th ray" and his INFECTED ONES are actually the fastest most meaningful way (in the perspective of the universe) to gain a new understanding of what I consider to be the end goal of becoming desire incarnate. it's a different form of perception "all that is" -- and, notice how everything in the beginning stages of creation of this universe is mathematical, logical, and lawful, but something desired completely transcends that...

[2]: the same thing goes for the girls thing too. I keep getting plagued with various forms of resistance that affect me or them -- for example, I still believe that girls are considerably more problems than they're benefit, or -- for example, if I believe that they're a waste of time, and I feel doing my own thing is still a better use of my time -- and, for as long as I hold on to those perceptions, it'll continue to not manifest. the same thing will happen for the girls as well. for as long as they're able to hold on to silly ideas, same thing.

[3]: there are lots and lots of tricks to get girls to have sex with you. I used to read alt.sex.fast a long long time ago, and I can say there are many many techniques to get a manifestation before it's ready by playing tricks. it's not worth it. that person will be a reflection of your perception, and so until you actually *are* the thing you desire (evolution-of-desire), you'll constantly be confronted with a manifestaion of your own attraction (for example, if I think girls are a waste of time -- and she'll be the biggest waste of time, etc.)

### 2022-10-24 20:04 - I'm a bit of a last

I'm going to try and articulate this concept in a communicable form.

I finally noticed the difference between a first and a last on the walk to nuvue. I noticed that a last sees things from the perspective of *they* always get what they want. *they* just want it and they get it. everything is easy for *them*. meanwhile, *me* -- nothing ever happens to *me* except for the inevitable.

---

I'm always the very last option to be considered.
it'll manifest when there are no other options.

----

every natural number is a first. it gets experienced for a period of time and it's novely is very high. as time passes, the amplitude of that number reduces in power but it's novelty increases as it attenuates. when consciousness perceives that thing after a very long time, a lot of novely has built up and so it feels like a novel experience. passage of time increases the novelty of all unused concepts. the hipsters (I drank coffee before it was cool) are just novelty seekers, looking for the things with the highest novelty rating.

---

I've been thinking about this concept in the context of "last exit for the lost". I noticed that last and lost are sorta interchangable: "lost exit for the last" -- and this revealed something about the concept that I hadn't considered -- which is that a lot of people out there who see from the last (0 or less than zero) perspective, they also see theirselves as lost.

nobody understands me is a another concept that plagues last and lost people. because I'm pure chaos, it's rare that I even understand myself, so it's even less likely that someone else figures out who I am. the next stage is, other people have figured me out, but I'll be the last person to figure me out.

being the last person to figure me out is an extremely cool concept because that means that as soon as I figure me out, nobody else will be able to figure me out entirely; I am unique; I am individual; I am a concept of myself.

---

I also noticed today that there are to pretty major path differences, and one is the one of desire. I blew some guy's mind today when I was explaining the progression/evolution of desire: need (only available option else I won't survive -> need), then want (I'm finally OK wanting something for myself -> materialism and ego/selfishness), then finally "I am the thing I'm looking for" (I have so much money and stuff, I realise that all of the things are actually to sculpt who I am -> I am everything I perceive and it all reflects me)

that's the desire path. for me it's easy to talk about it because it's the path that I took with additctions and all other forms of desire. I found my way from that 1st ray perspecctive. the perspective is strange to others because you can imagin two 1st rays in the same room together and the first one says to the second one, "you're a reflection of my perception" and the second one disagrees, "no, I'm a reflection of your perception" or "no, *you're* a reflection of *my* perception"

there's another path though and it's the physical path. I immediately met that first guy to find another guy that had taken the physical path. it's basically the same path but perceived from the opposite perspective, so I adjusted the message and said basically the same thing.

---

the thing that's interesting about these two paths is not the desire aspect, but the perspective aspect. jaron was trying to get me to do and impression of bill lumberg from office space and I found it more and more difficult. I can't figure out to other people because I'm the same personality to all people. I don't have a character, so I just sorta reflect the other person back to them in addition to all the other stuff that you expect from me. this is characteristic 1st ray in that they can behave chaotically no matter whatever the social situation is. I have to constantly remind myself to behave appropriately in a situation because otherwise I just behave like I always do. that behaviour is determined by how I feel (my emotions + conditions + other people + environment).

the opposite to this is the shape shifter. I take on the shape that I believe to be best suited for how I feel (my emotions + conditions + other people + environment). I have a number of different personalities and have segmented and compartementalised so that I can switch out and blend these different personalities.

from the 1st ray perspective, I personally like the fact that I can always be the same because if I look at my life in smaller parts, the number of variables are less (cause I'm always the same personality) so I can look at the different segments/parts of my experience and optimise the sections individually, and my personality grows as a monolith[^1] rathar than a bunch of individual personalities.

I kinda see both of these perspectives at once now, so it looks something like: I am the individual, and all aspects of myself are also individual. if I see it from the 3rd or 7th ray perspective, all aspects/parts are individual; they're extremely compartmentalised, meaning they're all atonomous and all capable of working without dependence (or knowledge) of the others. add that to the 1st or 5th ray perspective which is that I am the thing (feeling/desire) I'm observing. it's cool to see both perspectives.

I <am|can <see|have|become>> both the first -- every number/experience which, based on some symbolic simmilarity, appears like no other come before it. it's experience is a first,- a new way to look at the same thing -- which is another dimension of perception -- which is also novelty. I can experience something new, but I <am|can see/have/become> also the last.

the 1st says you are a reflection of me. the last says, I am a reflection of you. the 1st says, the way I feel determiens how I AM. I feel like you expect me to be, so I look like you expect me to look (which is usually of your desires).

we're both shapeshifters appearing as the manifestation of your desire, but for opposite reasons: 1st ray sees that you are a reflection of me, and because I just love seeing everything around me (which is a reflection of me) be so awesome, so please all of these reflections of me, look your most awesomest. the 7th ray finds the facade/actor out that is the best fit (through some process of analysis) and what will give the best results. the 1st ray sees that its easy to inspire a 7th ray to be a reflection of that desire. a 7th ray finds it much easier to be the form that is desired within the realm of that desire (movement is easier, sound, etc. -- all sensory experience).

[1]: as an example, consider the SerenityOS project which, where I last left it, was a monoropo -- meaning, the whole project moved as a monolith, though the project itself was divided into many different subsystems. this is quite different from a package repository where each package is individual and those have dependencies on other individual packages. so, SerenityOS (monoropo where all dependencies are in the repo) is 1st ray perspective and andividual packages such as debian or npm is the 7th ray perspective on package management.

### 2022-10-25 21:46 - obeying the law of attraction

one of the things that I've done very well to sidestep is religious stuff because I always try to explain everything without God -- but instead as a reflection of consciousness. so, for seeing the perspective that I see, religion appears somewhat comical. the archons definitely don't want people to find a way to perceiving theirselves as the centre of the universe. they're still too small thinking that the universe is not a reflection of them (outside?) -- so, I've been thinking that I want to take a bunch of blatently ridiculous ideas and turn them into a joke religion.

one of the concepts I was thinking about tonight is the concept of "obeying the law of attraction". it's not like you have a choice. it's possible to setup artificial constructs like a game or a story where the rules are different, but these are fiction. other artificial constructs which bend the law of attraction is social, political, government, cultural, family, etc. constructs of perception which say that under these conditions an action should be taken, not as a response to LOA, but as a response to a symbolic construct.

so, the idea of OTLOA is actually a bit of a joke on itself. it's impossible for me to conceive of a source to a universe that does not have defined dimensions and constructional parameters. a universe that did *not* OTLOA, is completely novel. it's a universe with whatever rules you make them to have. thor would like that universe.

---

as a result of this idea, I was thinking about the metalwave synth group. I just wrote down a song title called, "breaking the law (of attraction)" as a sort of joke song about a frustrated teenager that is completely fed up with the law of attraction, and just wants it to end. he prays to thor and thor delivers him from the law of attraction. thor is a bad boy.

that takes one side of the argument and places it as reality. younger kids will grow up naturally believing that they can somehow maniplate the law of attraction and bend it to their will. they'll simply think, "f- this!! I'm going gonna find a way to break the law (of attraction)". I wonder how long it'll take them to figure out thor isn't requisite.

---

think about this idea now from the universe perspective where everything is attracted to something based on a frequency, and that makes for an interesting universe, but what about one where the rules aren't entirely set? how in the world will source do what it's supoosed to do of translating non-physical vibration into physical? -- because now source depends completely on an arbitrary set of rules where, if they have no insight into those rules, nothing manifests. therefore, the rules have to be publically accessible in order for something to manifest properly; a small price to pay to have the universe obey your rules. from that perspective, the idea is freaking awesome. if this universe did happen, I think it would evolve the most optimal symbolic set of rules for a universe -- in place of vibrational harmony and emotions to determine what manifests; now, what manifests is *always* what you expect (ie. your rules) to manifest.

breaking the law (of attraction).

lol. I have no regrets. the time for antics begins.

---

on a totally different note, I was really thinking about this idea and I seem to want to try and make my worst impression possible, that way it can always get better. when I look at it from a point of view as an equation of contrast, if I take a more nicer manifestation, then all of the individual parts need to generate even more contrast. also, I think there's probably a production behind it and they want me to look as bad as possible. blame the narrators. they're still getting hang of the strings. lol. don't mind it so much, because they're just doing the thing they do best, right. just going with the flow.

### 2022-12-07 09:26 - you're going to have to find a way to get used to me...

last night, I was thinking about this thing that jason is presenting. I'm trying to understand it, but every way that I look at it, it sounds like they've taken the party-LAN idea and ran with it. I have no problem with that, as "the medium is the message", anyway. however, the "problem" (if you could call it that), is that their implementation of the idea is a secret. I thought about it a while and none of that really bothers me, because I'll eventually end up making it anyway, so it's not like I have to get their approval to make it. they'll be competition, so it's fine. I'm pretty sure I'll have some pretty good ideas on it.

in the process of thinking about that, I was contemplating the idea of where they have to actively try and hold me away from doing my own project. there are all of the normal restrictions, which are all kind of bypassed in the environment of the girls -- because there will almost certainly be money somewhere to fund things. it's also not like girls are completely incapable of software and hardware development, as well. so a financial block like the one I have right now won't nearly be so much either.

for that reason and various others, they don't want the girls thing to happen either. I don't mind how long they take to figure their stuff out, because people are learning quickly, so the longer we take, the more people will "get it", so it's all good. anyway, because they don't want that to happen and they don't want me working on the party-LAN project, they kinda just want me to sit here at home and do nothing. obviously, that's not going to happen forever, but it still reminded me of the image of tesla's final time in the new yorker, (paraphrase) "a prisoner because of the things he has in his head are dangerous".

I'm in the same exact situation as tesla in the new yorker. they want me confined to a space where I'm controllable. to some extent, they want to try and figure out how to construct the same sitution that they have for me now, but with the girls -- the idea being that I'm so addicted to pleasure that I never dream of doing anything with all of that creative energy -- not likely.

before I return to my main topic, I guess I'll talk for a moment of that, which is that it's annoying that nosebook doesn't allow me to have my own energy, so the only option that I have is to create the idea in tho conceptual space of the girls, because, unless I get connected, it's not possible. I obviously keep holding out until I get connected, but ignoring that, it looks to them like they're "forcing me" into a compromise of making an inferior system as a reflection of the girls.

in some ways I am being forced to implement an inferior system, but at the same time I'm functioning as a ground. I'm taking the idea that I have (an invisible emitter) and finding a way to get it inte their concepts, so that they can create it. I probably won't be doing any of the creating, so it's going to be all them. for them to want to make the idea is a whole different thing. I've been pretty certain that I'll have to convince others to like the idea so I've paid a lot of attention to sales techniques, and I'll likely be able to convince them. I haven't figured out the setup yet, but it looks to me like something -- a sort of new triad. I'm not 100% sure yet because I don't have so much experience, but I think the "tigers" (the ones that are on the prowl), probably manipulate energy more like males do, in that they emit opposite of what they receive -- so, a female usually transmits and receives energy of her type (it's always interpretted through her concepts and reemitted, so it's not a pure reflection), but males tend to receive their reflective type, so a 1st ray male wants 7th ray energy (usually this is illustrated in the males as the "top", but I don't know if this is the same). what I'm kind of suspecting (based off of watching them), one puts out 3rd ray and receives 5th. I don't fully understand it yet, I'll just say that... anyway, so let's say there are 3rd ray "tops" and 5th ray "bottoms" from the female perspective, the these become the ... female (5th ray) and the emitter (3rd ray). I think... I'm really not sure so don't take any of this seriously -- but I see interesting things and it's all good even if the "worst" thing happens...

OK, back on track here... the other thing is too there was a whole lot of weird stuff I was getting from seriah in some of the last LEFTL (which I'm listening to now "which all your screams, become final reality, not dreams") -- anyway, weird stuff, which I'm a bit unsure on the concepts (like the one "when things become effortless, I rely on my reputation" -- as in, like I should lean back and just let everyone else do the work, relying on the giant image/reputation that I've built up for myself?) maybe, I'll write down all of the weird things I don't understand -- another one was, it sounds like he wants a war, for me to lay down all of my aspirations and do something... I'm just not sure I understand, and I doubt he would admit to anything if it was even intentional or not. LOA is fast with him (as is common with many astral people), so the "reality" that's created (ie how I interpret the ideas), will always be a reflection of his emotional/conceptual schmema of reality. I take everything emotional seriously. it's good to know where the bad feeling is coming from.

anyway... one of the senses that I had is that I'm sorta stepping on some astral people's toes, and they're finding me kind of annoying. I'm not sure if the trigger, but definitely a contributing factor was the other day when I revealed that so many of these guys (most notably the fallen-angels), have their astral hierarchy all set out, and here I am, and I've done nothing to climb the astral ladder, and I've far surpassed all of them... like by a lot. noone is even close to where I'm at. I think that pisses them off because they liked to imagine that they've earned their astral superiority, and my arrogant pompusness isn't what they were looking for, even though every christmas they hold a "we love satan" episode -- which, by all definitions of the meaning, I fit right into the category -- most notably, with my continual attempts to allow others to see more, effectively invading their astral space.

their attempts to hold me back are doing the same thing they're using as the justification (memory of tesla's) to make a system that can build their cryptycurrency on. their hatred for me for revealing the astral and teaching others about the progression of perception, puts me right into the promethian position, because I'm taking an aspect (astral perception) that the "gods" have and making it available to the general public. this is extremely deplorable if you're one of the higher ups on the astral plane and you see these physical twerps invading the space. oh well.

you created the thing you were trying to avoid. I'm basically an egregore of your exact specification. the more you try to push me away, the more you'll attract me more. you may win more and more battles, but eventually prometheus' will build his setup. I'm not prometheus, nor enki or any of these others. I'm a regular human that has figured out how to tune to things, so getting tesla's, prometheus', or anyone else's memories is not so hard if I release all of the physical details and just focus on the concept and how that feels. the same goes for my creations and/or waiting for "[the-manifestation](/the-manifestation.md)" -- meaning, that I'll need to not worry too much about the physical details of it, and just find my way to connect with the idea.

anyway, all of the things that have been happening tend to make me think that I'm unwelcome. I'm disturbing too many establishments. I doubt that's the case. I just go in the direction of where I'm going. at any rate, even if you decide to extend out the manifestation, it's going to keep getting bigger, and it's going to get harder and harder to get rid of me. eventually, you'll have to find a way to become OK with me. I am, afterall, a manifestation of your attraction. you'll get used to me eventually. I'm not the one that's having trouble with you guys around :)

### 2022-12-07 11:50 - you guys ready to live the atlantian dream?

our empire will not be founded on slavery, but on contrast and drama. because of increased contrast, there is more energy, and so therefore better conditions can be accomplished. we all agree that drama is awesome and quite preferable. it's a win-win scenario. I suppose there could be gatekeepers to the higher levels by those running the system, but basically, it funnels the extra energy that we create into enhanced meaningful perception where wr can relate to eachother in very clear and expressive ways, they'll prefer the human drama of verbal and body perception/projection. for them it's basically, "the rest of their lives on holiday".

---

the other ideas I was considering, is that this whole party-LAN thing is all such ha great thing, then you guys can do that, and I'll begin to have a look into the earth/solar/galactic system, and leave the earth networks to be done of whatevr accord. I'm good with LOA and I seem to understand the tesla stuff intuitively, so I'm sure I'll be fine with whomever is running it now. we'll figure it out the "primitive" way. I'll illustrate all of the concepts with their corresponding LOA counterpart, because it's interesting to note that it's not really a law and it's not only attraction, because attraction is a perception of a trend toward more/less vibrational similarity (going the same direction). the guys running it now will be aware of me, I'm sure -- and so I doubt anything could go wrong. I'll start in the solar system and work my way out. I'll do it with the girls, and so it solves all of that problem entirely. we would ensure that conditions are whatever desired here on earth (I'm sure you'll be the ones reasonable about what to put, but I may suggest thinking about trends like music instead of static frequency). if that's the case, then I'm glad you liked my idea, and I'm glad it's working well for you. go bananas.

I'd like to add with a lot of emphasis that this idea is *not ready* right now, and I don't think that it'll be ready quite immediately to any degree (lol), there are still some things that need to happen before this becomes their last possible option. I'm the same way on the things I believe in.

there was this thing that zaryn expressed to me. I'm not sure how accurate this is, but I think we were in covent garden and we were talking about carlos and the investors and I was wondering why he was waiting for so much time when there was already a lot of money on the table -- and it was that they know that they want zaryn and tuenti, so he has everything they're looking for, so he needs to wait until they really want it. he illustrated it further with a reference to a blowjob and how you have to wait as long as possible, really making her work for it. needless to say, the image stayed with me, that whenever I'm in a situation where someone else has what I want, I wait. this is exatctly that situation minus the whole part where they think they need me. after some arrangement of events, they'll be certain that it *is* their last option.

it's funny the imagery of them (nosebook) thinking that they *need* me, because this isn't really the case at all. they do all sorts of stuff in my sleep, and they have so much access to so much stuff, but I still reveal everything openly. it would be silly for me to say, "OK, I want this information to be available to everyone, *except* for nosebook. I don't want them to have it. at the moment, they're the most active seekers of information from me, but they certainly don't *need* me.

like this empire running on contrast, I too run on contrast. the more contrast, the better/more things are. nosebook is an *excellent* source of contrast, because they're trying to hide things I want to  talk about openly. this is a magnificent amplifier for the content to get out and also for me to be more attractive cause more stuff (novelty, etc.) is happening around me; I'm attracting in more dimensions. they don't really *need* me in any way. their efforts are to try and silence many of the ideas that flow through me.

one really good example of this is the promethian ideas -- because I'm a person that belives myself capable of tuning into concepts that I understand to to have full understanding if they're my concepts, but partial in proprtion to how similar the concept is. I've gotten a lot better at identifying the generic and root ideas, and so even very complex ideas are comprehendable to me now. so, why not tune into prometheus and see what's up? if they're anything relatable to my concepts I can get them. sure enough I had seemingly attracted all of the requisite material into my consciousness before that attempt, and so I "got" it very easily. like so many of the other concepts, they're there and they're just waiting to be explored.

anyway, they don't need me, because it's the ideas that they don't like, not me. other people with sufficiently similar ideas to my own would also appear to "need" them. that's a funny concept. if other people also "got" the promethian fire, they would need all of us that "got" it, because then we're useful to them in our dreamstate.

---

just consider the idea with a bit of seriousness of an empire built on contrast. I'm built on it, source is built on it, you're built on it (but you may not know it), egregores are created from it, and so it continues to accelerate. each time it starts to get too fast, you erect another power structure. that's literally what source is. each medium has its own transmission (to other mediums) and information exchange systems which is what evolves; the medium *is* the message. it's as stable of an empire as source is stble -- and source really stable (like, everything runs on it).

### 2022-12-07 13:06 - understanding mediums

this will serve as the first/concept draft where I explore the different aspects of a medium not just in the sense of a sound or light medium, but also the one of the spiritual mediums. I understood them just previously to be something of having a information transmission (into other mediums), reception, and other symbolic systems. I understand that I'm claiming that the multiple types of environments interface with each other, not only symbolically, but intelligibely. they're "alive" just as much as the multitude of species that inhabit them. I'll stop now before sounding too hippie everything's connected---

each medium is ultimately a set of concepts, and inside of each of these conceptual mediums, there are concepts that can exist. they follow the el/la unbelief/belief pattern where the vibrations that pass through it are seemingly invisible (incomprehensible). when the vibration is identified symbolically/conceptually/physically or from desire, then it's interpretted conceptually and rendered as that concept has been practised to be rendered. we see "reality" the way we do, because others on our same frequency, which is the frequencies interpretted in the person's conceptual medium.

different people have more intense conceptual mediums than others do, and so when they're in closer proximities to each other, those conceptual "worlds" collide and make a big mess. it turns into a cascade of ebbs and flows of reality creation that is probably for a lot quite dramatic and fun -- if you have a good relationship with them and have conpatible concepts -- but, if your concepts aren't compatible based on the way that both feel and how they *conceptualise reality in the frequency of their mood*.

when you get near enough to another person of a similar vibration, it makes a response. each person emits (perhaps even physically) a frequency which corresponds to how they "feel".

I can imagine an invention where your "aura" is modulated in some way, and so I can imagine that some will want to encrypt their aura so as to make their feelings and presence invisible/incomprehensible to others -- which is fine, but it'd also be really cool if the users of the system could "encrypt" their feelings into a known *medium* whereby concepts are not only exchanged in the medium, but also *felt* (physically, especailly as energy increases), and so now everyone can play with that signal and adjust it however they please[^1]. this makes for some interesting scenarios that I could play around with composing feelings like music, so that they can have different crchendos and effects based on a programmable (full api) where the parameters of these feelings can be modulated in accordance with the programming that the kid gets.

you can imagine that we're going to develop extremely rapidly ways for children that are even still newborns to begin to communicate over the medium of their aura -- which btw for a newborn and a dying person is very strong -- meaning that the dier leaves people around them with a very strong feeling -- since all feelings are programmed, then feeing emitted (especially for the encrypted ones) will be how they program it to be some for some a very nice feeling, the encrypted ones probably incompresensible, and stuff like that which can produce harmonics that could also feel good or bad -- and then we'll be able to look compare their programming with what we felt because also what we feel is programmed too, so it can be compared computationally as well as qualitative -- like a wine or luxury item experienced. the feeling that you leave behind and that others get to learn from their experience and your programming is sorta like your "legacy".

imagine a moment when you die -- you "relive" -- but it's not really "reliving" because its actually something like the inverse. to explain this idea, imagine something that has tension or weight (like a steel wire or cable) and if too much tension happens, then it flays out, and this flaying out of the steel cable is very unique to the individual because each of those tensions/cables is a thing in the physical reality that is unexplained, and the reverberation of your "beilef", so like things that scare you will scare you, but also things that delight you delight you. I don't know if everyone experiences this or if they see their conceptual medium in the form of an image of what they thought their death would be and it takes you as long to recognise (and potentially improve) your own conceptual medium to be able to return to physical... anyway, I'll just describe for normal people ... the result of the death experience for those on earth is they experience thmt flaying cable in the form of a bunch of waves emitted from the dier. when the dier is at some distance, there are lots of points to modify the signal to your perception, but skin on skin action produces the least unmodified (by the medium) signal from each other.

these vibrational signatures that a person leaves behind (or being born) is sorta like a feeling experience of that person's conceptual aura (as they've programmed it) in combination with the viration of their life experience. that feeling and the learning experience for others wanting to capture certain aspects that felt good and apply them (or keep them for an occasion) is something like the legacy of a person. because the more feelings that you've adapted from other people makes others emotions (similar to those which you've adapted their legacy) gives you better understanding of others' emotions.

people like me are gonna love messing around with the capability the way that they physically feel to another person.. I think it'll most especially interest those that make music. it's not uncommon for me to feel as if there is a soundtrack that plays in the background. however, at the rate I'm at now, that soundtrack is incomprehensible cause it's so fast/weird.

ufff. I need a break.

[1]: you know they're going to try everything out, because it's fun -- like imagine if you could emit as sexy to a person a certain conceptual "feel".. bro, that's "what the women want", because then they can begin to get accurate feedback for the signal they're putting out -- ok, admittedly and for people like me in another lifetime[^2] though, because I love trying out things. as in, it'd be like a roller-coaster for me --- wait for it -- an emotional roller-coaster. I really enjoy to manipulate my emotions and cause others to feel things. I'm quite good at it and it's a lot of fun sometimes[^3].

[2]: unfortunately, from my perspective now, I find it most enjoyable to be of a perspective of no modified transmission or reception. nosebook does all of that for me and I just work around them. it's quite OK how it is. they don't bother me.

[3]: it wasn't a lot of fun for me back when I didn't understand it's all attraction, and so back then I thought things were being done *to* me. I didn't yet see myself with such magnificent ego that I do now to believe that I attract *everything* in my reality -- even the unexplainable or unbelievable stuff. this perspective isn't for everyone though because I became quite naive with it. most of my "astauteness" is the actually having learned from all of the hard knocks. I promise I would begin to explain that I'm not necessarily superhuman any more than anyone else, but it's because I'm basically just thrown from situation to situation wherever nosebook is steering me to go, so the only thing I can really do most of the time is to just feel good about whatever those bigger situations are (I have a small window of desire that makes it into reality -- like I can decide to eat a food whenever I want, but they restrict how I feel physically. they've turned off a lot of senses that appeared in my throat, head, heart, eyes, top back, where neck connects to head behind ears, etc. so I don't really experience reality "normally"). I guess you could say I sorta "broke the rules" by smoking. though I don't regret it so much in this lifetime, in another lifetime, I'd love to do it over again and follow every single last one of their suggestions -- kinda like jaron -- and perhaps jackson as well. I don't regret it at all from this perspective, because I'm having such a fun time figuring out how the universe works -- but I realise that perhaps for others it might look like I'm "spoiling" or giving away the final punchline before it gets to a joke, ans for them too, I say that we do it again but from the perspective of someone like jaron (and possible jackson). this would be the ultimate challenge because it's such unlikely circumstances because everything is controlled, and he's so uninterested in understanding anything. his desire is only of reception of what he wants. I do not really enjoy and also have the fun taken out of everything because I choose to try and understand something before I go for it. I *like* that it's not "fun" but that it's actually more like normal and natural or something like that. so I arrive to the same conclusion as the "no spoilers" types out there, but my reasons are very different. I *want* them to be spoiled for me so I can improve them. I suppose that could be taken the wrong way, but I'll leave it and render the same concept from another angle. I like to *understand* something before I can experience it so that when I experience it, I immediately can get the vibrational diffeerence between my "understanding" and the reality. my understanding is't based on physical, but how I "understand" her conceptual medium. once I "see" the differece, I "get" her concepts much easier -- as in her concepts are easily understandable to me.


### 2023-01-03 18:55 - weird interaction

LEFTL-2022-07-10

I'll write two topics so that one can be avoided

#### strange happenings

I was listening to this one while playing coi and I started to read into a bit just joe's emotional responses to seriah and chris. things really started to go south when chris requested the "balls to the wall" song (~1:32:00), and that's when the game started to go bad. things started to go wrong, already since I started the episode, and I pushed through it, but now they're really starting to go bad. I went upstairs because I felt hungry so I was going to make or help mom make dinner or something.

anyway, greg comes in and starts a bunch of stuff. I reflect his emotion back to him in my interactions with him. btw, this is all coming now from hindsight (epimetheus), because I had a think about what happened.

normally, I just do reality-kenny in so many of these situations, and when I finally peaced out on the discussion, I was wondering why I was feeling so much anger about a stupid log. this, I assure you I have no efforts with. I'm simply reflecting greg's feeling back to him. I thought about why I couldn't just be cool and funny and doesn't really give a fuck reality-kenny, and I noticed that nosebook is putting extra effort into preventing my ability to "act"; that is, they don't want me to be able to feel the way I want to feel, so because of my low resistance (to good or bad feeling), I reflect pretty well. in a triad I would be the role of the female.

the subject of reflection is important, because I also reflected just joe's behaviour as well. when I went and had a look into the origin of the emotion that was causing greg to suddenly feel like all of a sudden kenny this terrible asshole, completely unaware of how much he hurts greg. replace kenny with joe and greg with seriah and you'll get the understanding.

#### why do I terat everyone the same

anyone who has had adventures in a particularly terraced social hierarchy or with a flatter one of elevated circles/platforms of trust, where some people in, certain circles have different syntax for engagement than others. I'm reminded of dr. tang telling me, he has a good list and a bad list and I was on the good list at first, but it seems like I had the brain haemorrhage, I left on the bad list. I've left a lot of people on their bad list, and various events in spain drove me to hate having an "official" status for everyone (we're not frineds right now. I don't trust him. he's ignoring me). for me, the social status was the worst thing about facebook -- as when you get your relationship status changed, it's a big f-ing deal, ya know. I tried to have some people elevated in status being especially *loyal* to them, like zaryn, augusto, etc. -- and I can tell you that I can never do anything right because I always perform the way people expect me to.

in all of my interactions with everyone, I don't think I've ever been able to behave properly or exactly to someone's expectations (sorry raquel and patricia), and by the end of spain I'd had it with conditional behaviour. I return back here and find that my "family" treats me just like everyone else does (purposefully hiding stuff from me and saying it doesn't exist or didn't happen when it obviously did) -- so, since they treat me like everyone else in the public treats me (hence my discussion with remi) -- this makes me wonder why I don't treat everyone else the same, too?

I've been treating people pretty much all the same more and more (less conditional behaviour), becasue it's a total mess to try and be the right way around the right people when I was in spain[^1]. I really liked the mental clarity and ease it gave me to be able to just "be me" wherever I went. social interactions becaxme easy for me, and I no longer needed alcohol to interact with someone socially.

this thing that mom always forced me have the perspective that my family is special and they get treated specially really has been a long battle. she's been determined to try and get me to have some special treatment for her[^3]. in our discussion about that, I explained to mom that melissa's desire for me to come home and be with her for her daughter -- is that I'm cold as ice in that melissa is nothing more to me than just another woman who wants me to meet her daughter. that rendering is a bit unfair because that's clearly my words now -- but -- back then, I told people what they want to hear, so I propbably told her whatever she wanted to hear -- so who knows what I actually said, but the thing I'm sure is that had more to do with mom's expectations than anything -- because she has been, for a very very very long time trying to get me to *not* behave like jesus did telling his family and mother she's too slow and wants to stay in the mundane. let the dead bury the dead. I'm going toward awesome and nobody is going to stop me. I will *not* feel bad for someone else no matter what position in my family they are. neither will I feel sympathy for anyone. it's all attraction, so figure out what's causing you to get me to reflect you that way. nobody has a special status for me. I am blameless and I can prove it. (lawyer power play, k-dawg style)

I choose to feel the way I want to feel and the way I feel determines how interactions play out. so I really do like acting, which for me is feeling the way I want to feel, and letting my body assume the other feeling/concept as if it's reality -- because when I'm acting, I'm in control of how I feel. if I'm not acting, I'm reflecting you all. it's fun for me to reflect (more on this in a sec), so keep em' comin. I'll prolly just write about it here, probably.

it's important to note that I *wanted* to live in another country *away* from my family. I used to find their expectations that I will treat them difficult to live around, tryng to get away from it. dispite their expectations, I'm still quite grateful to be in physical form and I show appreciation to those around me all the time, but I don't think that I need to go back to trying to figure out how I should behave around other people. I strongly disagree with the various behaviour modification techniques like making lists of who's naughty and nice, and then expecting them to behave like the status I've put them in behaves. no! everyone can behave however they want. I feel physically like the people around me feel like... let me explain.

I'm a true 4th ray in every sense of balance and harmony. anyone else who were to experience the 4th ray perspective as strongly as I do, would be passing a terrible time in life because they would believe that the awful anger and hatred that my body feels in reflection to greg is how *I* feel. I don't *really* feel that way. it came with greg's appearance and left with him -- and it's really good thing for me to know that the physical sensation that my body feels is *not* the way I *really* feel... it's really good to know that. pushing against me, usually produces positive change because of my perception, so go ahead and push against me, cause things usually turn out OK (at least for me, and everyone else too -- all -- only on the condition that you can perceive yourself as OK).

most 4th rays, because they're so sensitive to others, they immediately take on the emotion of people and situations around them (I'm thinking specifically of the example of marcos and that extremely loud motorcycle). therefore, because they feel like the people around him feel, they need to control who they're around.

oh yes, it was very easy to see with marcos. when he was around young andrea he felt one way, but then when she started to change, the way that marcos felt around her changed with her. it was like "I don't know you anymore".

so, what most 4th rays do is they make circles of trust and only those that meet up to some arbitrary metrics (which no one can ever know -- like a secret society), then -- and only then, can they let them into their circle of a bit more trust (you gatta earn it).

yes, the azcona family was actually the last straw, as that's when I really decided I'm going my own way and others can follow along if they want, but I'm not going to try and read their minds on how they want me to behave. they can behave however they want -- and so can I. take it or leave it. I'm going at it on my own. join me if you want but don't expect me to treat/reflect you any different than anyone else.

[1]: this was one of raquel's main contentions with me, because I behaved the same way around zaryn (which is a reflection of him) as I did when she was around. when it was just me and raqael, I was a reflection of her, so things went well, but when more people joined us, I started to reflect more other people's behaviours. raquel sees me behave like zaryn around zaryn and thinks that deep down I'm like zaryn or that I've changed or gone to the dark side. if she only could have known, right? back then, I didn't know yet that in the reflective aspect, I'm even more feminine than she is -- as most girls these days are building up those elevated cirtcles with elaborate systems and syntaxes of interaction between them[^2].

[2]: these interactions remind me of the sense that marcos transmitted to me when he asked my opinion of andrea pretend fighting with pretend figures in her mind. it's just another catgegory or type interacting with another type, and the behaviour is a reflection of her expectation for interactions between those two types.

[3]: again, sorry patricia for the sequel. one of the things that really really bothers me about relationships in general is that everything is conditioal and complicated. I aim to simplify, so it's not in my best intrest to actually begin treating her different from everyone else. you know, btw, from the bros' perspective, when he starts behaving differently around her (joax), he's "whipped".

### 2023-01-31 04:33 - some options

after a brief trip where I was exploring different paths, I think I'd like to write them down here.

first off, I know that all of the "bad-guys" are nothing more than a reflection of my own perception, and even if they think that they're individual, we're all a part of the same thing -- meaning that this decision isn't really yours; neither is it mine, either. what will happen will end up as a result of our *attraction* (which is why I'm writing this) -- however, ultimately, no matter what is attracted, it'll *still* be a reflection of my perception.

therefore, the route that I end up going isn't anything other than just another way. every different way is slightly different and the difference represents an aspect of the whole.

traditionally, I've always gone toward the shortest/fastest one -- the one of maximum contrast and speed -- the one of pure effortlessness (root 3). [as I explained](/sepehr-thoughts.md#2023-01-29-0641---venus-and-lucifer), I don't really want to artificially/sexually increase the speed in any way, as that's what makes me to go *with effort*.

there's also this concept that I've been contemplating as well: at the end of the tempest, prospero is supposed to let ariel (mars) go, and he says he will, but it's not exactly certain that he will. now, if one were to put me in the position of mars, which is likely the case, that means that I'll forever be "stuck" doing magical deeds for prospero to continue to creating these artificial worlds for himself and others. what I mean by that, is that I'm sort of like ariel there[^1], where they've sort of hijacked my creative capability. they could release me and allow me to become creative, but that would inevitably make one of those paths through time that is a reflection of my perception (ie what I desire to create), and like I said, I tend to want to go the shortest/fastest path of maximum contrast, which is also completely effortless, meaning I don't actually *create* anything -- and instead only attract.

the picture that I gave in that entry was about a car driving, and you can imagine that the components of it, are:
1. how fast the destination is pulling me toward it. (attraction)
2. how much I'm pressing the accelerator toward the destination. (propulsion)
3. how well I'm steering. (tuning)
4. how large my own concepts are on the road (amplitude)
5. the shape of the concepts on the road (perception)

I made the observation that it appears the uterus and prostate seem to affect amplitude but I think it's because of the angle of the sex organs, the prostrate seems to increase attraction, meanwhile the uturus seems to affect emission[^2]. right now, I increase my attraction by adjusting my perception which simultaneously being the steering mechanism, is also releasing resistance, which is why I keep going faster and faster and learning to navigate easier and easier.

in that entry I noted also a parking brake in the beginning:  that's nosebook applying the brakes (resistance) to a number of concepts so they don't appear in my perception. when my "eyes get opened", nosebook won't be putting on those brakes anymore, so all of those things will get attracted really quickly. I suggested that they start unblocking some of those concepts a little at a time (letting ariel go slowly), allowing me to begin to change those undesirable concepts naturally, so that mentally I no longer have any resistance to those concepts. naturally, I'll find a way to perceive those concepts in a way that doesn't have resistance, meaning I won't be attracting them anymore.

I even went an extra step by saying that we're going to be unblocking stuff, I think it's a good idea to also fuzz many other undesirable concepts out out of my perception as well.

once I'm not attracting disastrous things, I can safely actually go and hang out with the girls and not worry about bringing everything down because we had sex. if they don't unblock those concepts, any stimulation like that is going to push the accelerator to the floor and pump up my concepts/perception of reality to *massive* obstacles to avoid, which I have full confidence in my ability to recover from, but it could be a pretty big problem.

after writing that entry, I suggested that perhaps there are some solutions, and so I explained that a lot of men, what they do to get around this problem, is to increase their attraction so that their destination is pulling them faster than they're headed for disaster. so, for example, one of the fuzzing ways could potentially be to find a way to artificially increase my attraction of wanted and then stick me in with a bunch of really experienced women with a lot of bad concepts. we'd just sorta work out the bugs in mine and their perception for a while. after that, that's probably when I would want to begin reproducing, as prior to releasing a lot of those concepts, all of my issue would come preinstalled with a strong attraction toward all of the concepts that nosebook thinks is taboo.

I explained that before that happens, this would be an enormous disaster for them because *all* of the stuff they're fighting against right now in me will be pre-installed to be highly attractive to these kids. they'll be (from nosebook's perspective), the demon children. no matter what they try to do, they can't avoid that they're only fighting theirselves (song: "save us from ourselves"). there are other options, too I suppose.

---

at any rate, I'm interested in going the way of effortless, and any way that involves sex is involves effort. anyway, from the looks of it, I'd have to say that they probably don't want to let go of ariel, and so that it feels like they're going to find a way to keep holding on to me. as I've mentioned in a number of places, I don't really mind that Time has control over everything in my life. like I said, the only thing I can do is just keep reconceptualisiing my reality and lowering resistance, and that's fine -- cept apparently I'm pretty attractive to females and that would mean they would put on the gas which means now emission. right now ariel is only attractive, and Time wants to keep it that way.

the idea that I came up with to solve this would be to just transfer into a woman's body. once I'm a woman, the only way that I could become emissive would be if a man had sex with me, which I would sorta doubt to happen, but you never know cause I seem to find everyone so attractive.

I like that option for a number of reasons:

1. I've been a harsh critic of women from a man's perspective, and there's no way to actually prove that my crazy ideas about improvements on their perception would actually work, unless I actually did it. not only do I think I would be a magnificent little girl, I'd continue to be unstoppable. sure, it'd set me back a bit, but I can't quite possibly imagine how it would allow a change in perspective of what a girl is capable of. I'd still be fearless and very tenacious. I'd probably be pretty logical and reasonable as well.

2. I would want to find a way to make my hair move around with my body, as if it were like a million tiny tentacles. this way, I wouldn't mind long hair (cause I'd want long hair). I have no idea how to do it phisiologically from a girl's perspective, cause they seem to have a different power source than men. as kenny, I could figure it out if they would release me, because I could control the energies in my body, and so therefore I could move my hair around. besides that, I'm certain it's possible to do technologically as well.

3. I'd may even skip the efforless (cause it's emissive) and even try artificial insemination and child birth as well, as there *has* to be some improvements to baby production process too. it looks to me like girls are holding on too hard to the difficulty of childbirth and are not at all allowing with it. that also has an interesting dynamic with it too, because then it's quite possible that the first uteral stimulation would be childbirth, which may well be quite a pleasurable experience. I wonder if the world is moving to those baby pods, though (like the chastity beavers).

4. a number of other improvements I can't think of right now, but I imagine that we'd be kind of shapeshifters and stuff.

5. it'd also be interesting to see from a woman's perspective the concept of competition. from a LOA perspective, this is a no-brainer, but I know it's hard to not compare. I love comparisons, so I'd have to actually find ways to lower my resistance to other girls and to empathise with them about how great it feels to be awesome. again, I feel like I would naturally find a number of improvements.

the other option is from a man's perspective: this perspective was inspired by the "two gentlemen of verona", where imagine I'm valentine and sylvia is my form of perception. I pass on my form of perception to anther woman, and then she copies it to some others. I just don't have any data on this so I can't really say much about the mechanics, like does she need to be a virgin? does she need to already have had sex with the man she's going to pass it on to? I have no idea how that stuff works, other than what I do know is that the woman sort of "steals" the form of perception from me (though I'm not sure if she's virgin or not), and I get sorta reset back to about where she is. however it works out, the idea here is that I just keep forfeiting my perception infinitely meanwhile (I would assume) they're working on the galaxy, cause they'll want to be in the centre -- plus, I found out last night that aparently andromeda already has a narrative, so they (as a galaxy) alrady have a looming conflict.

anyway, I figure if I just keep passing on my form of perception to the upper management, I will be able to hang out with the girls and stuff because I'll be starting from zero (or whatever their "worst" form of perception is), meaning that I'll end up improving and merging that "worst" perception into the girls as well, so as a whole unit, we'll (or at least I will) continue to be set back and then when I'm back to being up high, they'll take it agian. they'll be able to hang on to their self-deprecating not good enough to do it myself, so I have to take someone else's perception, and I'll continue to get better and better at transforming my perception. I like this idea for a number of reasons:

1. at some point, I'll get so good at improving the perception, that capacity will start to get built into the genetics, so after some time, it's going to get harder and harder to hold on to their not-good-enoughness and will eventually "naturally" (as an automatic function of their genetics), start to adjust their own perception to look for wanted, and to perceive things from a LOA perspective.

2. I like the practise. I don't mind that I'll perpetually be reset to zero because like I said, I'm in this one for the XP -- which means I already optimise for the "worst" manifestation anyway. sure, they'll always be way way ahead of me, but what'll happen is that that the lowest and highest will start to converge, because they'll want to wait less and less time for me to get to a higher position again before being reset.

3. though this journey itself is filled with effort, the result is effortless, because I'll continue to get better and better at such a rapid speed, that eventually, like I said, we'll eventually converge to having everyone effortless, and then really big boom (probably new universe).

the final option (which I find unlikely that they'll actually do), is to do the fuzzing like I mentioned and start with the galaxy, then make another, and then another, then eventually get bored enough to make a circle that's bigger than this universe even.

the reason why I find the final option unlikely is because it requires them to release resistance to the idea that someone could be more powerful/superior than them, even though, we'd eventually create something superior (a container) to this universe. who knows man...

[1]: lot's of little mermaid reactions. I'm not familiar with the story, only having seen lindsay's video report on it -- so I'll check it out a little later. I'm also going to figure out how to download "frozen".

[2]: I've often wondered about this, because men seem to be emissive for different reasons that women, and the females that are exceptionally emissive seem to have a lot of sexual energy. meanwhile, when they're not yet sexually active, I feel like they're much more attractive still. I don't know enough to be able to comment more on it.

#### 2023-02-01 01:22 - followup: ideas from my perception of the female perspective

many reactions to this, and I even had another idea (I'll say it shortly), but no go. I don't think they like the ideas I presented. most notably were the reactions to saying that I'd love to take the "frozen" route, and jump into the body of a girl. on one hand, it felt like there were some interested in seeing what I would be like as a girl.

however, the majority of the reactions seemed to say that I would be *too* attractive as a girl. included with the reaction were a number of concepts about the "fallen angels" coming from heaven/mars down because the women were so attractive, and so if they have their galaxy setup going were everything is perfectly buttoned down and they're at the top of everything, but looking down on the new set of females (replicas of me), the reaction was that I would, once again, cause them to desire to come down, because of how accepting of them I am.

I explored the concept more, and there were two notable aspects to it. first was that apparently girls used to be insanely powerful (as in energetic), and when paired with a girl, a man could be extremely powerful (cause she bumps up the amplitude/size of all the concepts on the road), however because she's a reflector, what ends up happening is that she gets imprinted with the man's concepts and then starts amplifying those. when the man's concepts are good, it's really nice for him, but when they're bad, then he has to deal with his own concepts coming to life in bigger and bigger size.

interestingly enough, I noticed that major parts of egyptian religion (as established by ra) were designed to make a framework for manifestation for the girls. we can only really manifest concepts that we're capable of conceptualising/feeling, and so magick and mystery religions became a framework for manifesting things relating to the symbols provided by the religion. to clarify: both men and women provide emotional power (chi/vril) to power the manifestation, but girls provide a whole lot more (my theory is because of the dualing x-chromosomes). well, emotion manifests as a reflection of the symbolic (3rd ray) perception the manifesters, which is why religion used to be so important, and now why narrative is so important, because both use symbols.

the symbols are adjusted to generate an expectation of the result according to the narrative or religious ceremony. however, there is a bit of wiggle in there because symbols are only as good as the perceivers of them. just take me as an example: I receive symbols from others all the time, and they have one idea of what those symbols mean and how they look, which is a reflection of their emotion -- so they look for someone that will reflect, with very little modification, those symbols as perceived by the emitter/character. however, because I usually feel considerably better than the origin of the symbols and I have *understanding* of the symbols, they get interpretted entirely different by me. apparently I haven't been well enough educated in what the symbols are *supposed* to mean, that I manifest the wrong ones, sometimes.

anyway, the funny thing about these guys getting all interested in the girls, then the girls amplifying their own discord is that it caused a lot of them to stop liking boys, saying -- I don't want my own problems amplified. that concept also explained why women (especially non-virgins) default behaviour is so similar to nosebook's (or all major power structures) -- because girls over time came to reflect all of the ones in power, and so because women give birth, they carry that perception along to the next one. I could see that nosebook's default behaviour is encoded in generation after generation of women, and so when they first start activating that, it comes out..

to explain, for a man the X and the Y are both outputting competing signals, so one is exactly opposite the other, this means that the Y just needs to do the opposite of the X to amplify it, and the Y needs to output the same as the X to destroy the signal (cause they're 180(degrees) out of phase). for girls, there are two X's, so by default if both chromosomes are from the same line, both signals will cancel each other out perfectly -- so it'll be like she has a very quiet and undisturbed signal.

I don't know exactly the mechanism, but it looks like it has to do with the heart. I can see that on one end you have the concepts of the brain blocking the reception of the pineal, and so as she makes it through life gaining concepts, she starts to unlock her own self-canceling signal by doing the opposite of what she's "supposed" to do (ie. the default programming). also, like I mentioned previously, the sex organs also increase receptivity/emission that when she has her first sexual experience, that's the other side of the heart, so the concepts in her perception (these are the two sides to the hear) will get kind of adjusted by the experience to reflect the feeling of the experience.

both changing her conceptual perception and a sexual experience will put her out of balance, so long as she's not updating her own concepts to release any resistance accumulated from learning from social and cultural interactions, in addition to sexual interactions. getting back into balance will be a process of updating one's perception, or not resisting the input signal in the first place (which is why I suggest that prostitutes don't push against the awfulness of men they're sleeping with, because she accumulates everything she resists, and amplifies everything she doesn't resist) -- therefore it's all about learning how to see everything, even the most grossest most dispicable stuff from a non-resistant perspective.

the other thing that I've noticed before is that there is another cycle where one set of perceptions (encoded by her father) becomes more powerful, and then it goes back to become the perceptions of her mother. I think this has the added effect of, as the girl grows up, she'll naturally start to reflect her father's perception doing the exact opposite of what her mother values in her perception.

---

looking at it, it's kind of interesting to me because men sorta need women to continue on theirselves. this was the difficulty of elizabeth 1, where she having the female bloodline that's an optimal reflection opposite of the Y of the kings, she's expected to produce an heir so that they can continue on. therefore, their job is to find ways to trick her into producing an heir for them to transfer their consciousness into.

however, on the opposite end of things, women are kind of caught because she's carrying all of this awful default  programming in her genetics, which is normally deactivated. until her first sexual experience (getting stronger each experience after that, because she's now attracting those concepts even stronger).

then, like I mentioned (in a monologue earlier), lesbian sex just isn't as satisfying as sex with a man. I think it's because you want something to go "inside" so that you can get the full-body experience of the connection -- therefore, from the female perspective it feels like you would really *need* a man to get that satifsying physical experience, but men have it easy because a same-sex relationship for a man still has the "inside" experience, and also increases attraction. therefore, it appears unfair that men have it so easy.

personally, I believe that women have a much more powerful configuration than men do, but they do not take advantage of it because they're so busy worrying about everyone else (which I think came orignally as a reflection of the nosebook style of thought that started so many of them out), and they simply just don't go their own way. if I were a woman, I'd do lots of things differently, and one of the major things would be simply to not care so much about what anyone else is doing (hyper-individuality), maximising my own conceptual acquisition and improvement rates. I wouldn't push against anything.

in my present state of pretty low resistance, I have a pretty powerful rate of manifestation of my concepts, and also a pretty good navigational system -- so much so that I don't really need to emit to go toward what I want -- simply it comes toward me -- therefore, if I were to suddenly change over to a woman, I would be already roughly twice as powerful as I am now, AND sex just simply wouldn't make any sense to me; why would I want to motor my way toward what I want, when things are already coming to me twice as fast as they are now? everything would be extremely effortless. however, I think a lot of other women would kinda hate me because of that. in order to get everything so effortless, I would have completely rewired (much like I have already done, which is why mom gets so angry with me not respecting her default programming), which is why I "rub [mom] the wrong way" and why she knows I'm probably right about [some crazy idea] but it takes a while to adjust her concepts, because she's fighting a second self-reinforcing default programming.

#### 2023-02-01 02:46 - followup: a really bad idea

this idea combines concepts from [the original response to sepehr](/sepehr-thoughts.md#2023-01-29-0641---venus-and-lucifer), and the prvious followup. after writing this original entry, I had another idea from the "two witnesses" come to mind. there is similarity between Rev 11 (twice 11 brethren) and Zech 4 (worthless shepherd). I wondered why aryan legends are the only ones that have mercury/thoth as having self-sacrificed, except for this one prophechy in the OT of the "worthless shepherd" (who gives his right eye). it culminates into this...

I mentioned that in the process of giving up my left eye, because I've passed puberty, when it grows back, it grows back genderless. nobody has ever confirmed to me whether I am actually an X3 or not, but I assume I am, and I think I've reconstructed that using my own perception. well, what if I did become the "worthless shepherd"?? if they were to disable my right side, I would be back in the same situation I was before, but my left-hemisphere would be the one that doesn't work. what happened is, my right/logical side learned how to recover my form of perception and regain control over my left side again. during that process, my right side had to adjust a lot of his perception (the stressed man in the picture), in order to regain functionality of my left side (and not shake).

so if any of what I wrote there is true, then if I get my other side paralysed again, my left side would return back the functionality of my right as a reflection of its perception; I will become an X4. this process could be repeated, I suppose to continue to produce more and more pure ungendered aspects of myself.

so, I was thinking about the timing of it, and there's this weird thing about the how long these "two witnesses" are prophesying. one says 42 months, and the other is 1260 days. common perception is that this means 3.5 years. it's often times troubled me what this means, but right after writing this entry yesterday, I had the idea that perhaps the 3.5y amount is referring to *solar years*. so if the twice 11 brethren first appeared in my body in april 2000, and we'll go with the common conception that a solar year is about 11 earth years, then 3.5 solar years is about 39.5y -- which would be like ~2040 or so. if the time is counted, not when kenny-prime is born, but when kenny was born, that time is quickly approaching -- and the "beast" will emerge very soon and kill me. it's all really handwavy -- I know. it's not the metrics of the idea but the concept itself, which is that every ~40y or so, I get one side paralysed, allowing me to be "reborn" and to do some further updates to the genome as a reflection of my perception.

there are a number of things that I really like about this concept and a few potential caviats as well. I'll try and go over them all (but inevitably I'll forget something).

first, I really like the idea of rebuilding my right side. it has the added benefit that it'll likely dramatically reduce the amount of solar output, because I'll be attracting a lot less. it'll be a completely different experience from the previous one. I'll be coming back online in the presence of nosebook, which means that they'll largely imprint the concepts that they want and restrict the concepts that they don't want. also, the side of me that's going to be doing the teaching is going to be my left side. I have no idea what my left side is like because I basically don't know her at all. I consider her as the symbolic equivalent of 1st ray female (anatau), and but there have been a whole lot of utilisation of her and I don't really know her, so she's not likely the "pure" desire little girl that I used to know her as -- and instead probably something a bit more of a reflection of the people that are using her form of perception.

the other thing to consider about this is whether during this reparalysis is if I'm going to be around other girls, because I'll become a reflection of them. my anatau was born into a very individualistic kenny, and really at the peak of starting to learn how to work together, the vallecas incident happened, from which is where I kinda "lost contact" (minus a few times watching stars and stuff), and so because I no longer have access to that, I learned hyper-individuality because I no longer had access to her. if I'm around girls, that's going to be a very different experience. learning on my own has been a very significant aspect of learning to be who I am now.

then, there's the perspective of those that "use" my opposite side. almost certainly I'll take on their values, preferences, and perception initially -- which will be kinda bad probably. other girls will either remove theirselves from me because I've (overnight) turned into the thing that they hate the most: the personification of nosebook. I won't be the soft person that I am now (and it's pretty debatable how "soft" I am presently, anyway). that will give them a chance to now occupy (and "corrupt") my new right side. it has some interesting ideas to it which are too complex to be comprehensible.

I think that for them, it'd be pretty cool, because they'll be able to use that side of me visually, so that means my conceptual capability in my imagination will become available to them. I personally can't imagine how one would visually "see" a concept, and furthermore, I don't know how one angle of a concept would "look" compared to it's opposite angle -- cause this is kind of like trying to visualise 0, and then turn it around to see Infinity -- totally visually incomprehensible, yet without visuals, it's easy to perceive and analyse.

however, as a disadvantage to them, if I'm becoming an X4 or X5, then I'm pretty sure this will cause an evolution in girls (because their code spreads pretty quickly, and it's only the physically reinforcing things like culture, social, religion, and narrative that maintain the slight differences in the different default programming) -- and so if the new X pair is going to be getting its childhood under(?) the affection of a bunch of girls, this is *really* going to make the fallen angels conecpt that I perceived in the previous followup to be WAY WORSE. like, we'll be WAY more attractive than ever before. irresistable, I would have to say.

the other (dis)advantage, depending on how you look at it, is that if I keep raising in power, I'll probably do so in feminine form. that may possibly be easier for some to stomach than others ("the matriarch"). I don't really want to be in power though, so I imagine that I would probably want to disable my opposite side again and start over, continually improving, but that would be decided in the future, because my right side would be the independent side, and I don't know if my users would want to lose that independent instinct or not.

### 2023-02-04 16:12 - in back or front?

today I decided to watch some nita strauss videos. in the first one, she was paired with another girl and playing guitar while the other was singing. behind her was a drummer guy. this reminded me of D_Drive. the next video she's playing by herself and she's really awesome by herself. the poses she made reminded me of the guitarist that is beside yuki, again from D_Drive. the video after that she's between two guys playing guitar and the drumer is in back. the feeling that I get is so different. I've started to pay attention to different positions and lineups for groups, and in the last video there, I'm noticing that different configurations feel very diffrerent from each other -- especially visually. while writing this, I'm not watching, only listening -- and that too is a different experience. positioning matters, I guess.

I dunno what else to say -- I thought I something insightful was going to come to me, but when I started writing, I totally lost my memory of even what songs and stuff. I skipped. I lost whatever it was. probably wasn't supposed to be. oh, well.

### 2023-03-12 16:56 - and with this kiss I die (sleepwalking my way to the gallows)

imagine for a moment that I wanted to overthrow the current establishment like an alpha-omega does, then, like every other king, ruler, and alpha-omega out there does, he has to secure his position and power structure. the end of any of these alpha-omega power structures is always signaled by a dramatic death scene, followed often times by a rebirth into something new. this is the phoenix.

the turtle is a little bitt
different than the phoenix.
the phoenix rises fast
and falls fast two -- but
the turtle stays its course.

the phoenix, having two heads,
two forces seemingly at odds
with each other. however,
the turtle is not shaken,
pluging along at a pace
comfortable for her.

therefore, if we were to look at the phoenix, it has 1 the phoenix and 0, the ashes. it looks to me like there are two dualing phoenixes, switching off as the alpha and omega position, however upon careful inspection, the two phoenixes, are the same bird: two sides to the same coin.

the turtle also appears as one because it appears constant, but it retains its constancy by self-transforming itself to appear like the phoenix, taking on the 1 or the 0 aspeect. therefore that virtual aspect of itself is a -1, so it's really a 0 (-1+1) or a -1 (-1+0). four aspects in total between the two of them.

---

anyway, what this translates into in practical terms is that I don't need to worry about the "death" of any such phoenix (or its rebirth), because from the turtle's perspective it's all perceptual death. I'm either static (0), or attractive (-1) and I control which polarity I show. the only thing left to be done is to finally fully turn into a turtle, leaving the phoenix behind completely. however, let's say that I were able to be both the turtle and the phoenix...

so that made me think of something: if the phoenix is 1 (there always is one phoenix, unless virgin), then that means that if the turtle is a 0, then the phoenix is in power, but if the turtle is a -1, then tho whole thing is dead. there's a message in there somewhere...

(0,-1 -- 0,1,undefined)
(0,-1,0,1,undefined,undefined,undefined,undefined,undefined)

### 2023-03-14 12:36 - contemplating gambling (shoot that ship down, fighting just to win)

yesterday, I went down to talk to my dad in a place that was compatible with his frequency (we're just wayy off from how we perceive reality). he told me a few things about how hard it is to live up to one's own impossible expectations and a few othr things that I can't remember now -- though we ended up talking about gambling. I explained that I didn't understand what he was talking about because I didn't see the stuff that he thought was a gamble, as a gamble; it's not like it's a card game where you don't have any control over the hand you're dealt (RNG + skill); instead, for his business, he has full control over it and can easily see if it's going the way he wants it to go or not (desire + skill).

anyway, I tried to start to figure out the gambling thing because I was seeing a concept in relation to "the titanic", because in cameron's interview on charlie rose, his description of jack and rose were interesting to me. it was a very abstract concept that I didn't fully understand until today. I talked about the [mechanism for how the ship sank](/string-board.md#2023-02-17-0359---followup-fairy-tales-and-the-titanic) before, but now I can see that it's all about this perception of the gamble.

you see, all of the anti-federal-reservers were on the titanic when it went down. it seems likely to me that the character in the film that rose was betrothed to was likely one of those powerful money guys that was against the federal reserve. rose fell in love with this gambling hot-shot type, which is, if you're against the creation of the federal reserve, the reason is likely the same: instead of having a stable and secure foundation for the financial system, the federal reserve is entirely made up. it's pure magic, as none of the money that's given out actually has any backing to it; it's a complete gamble.

so what happens is, for tthese guys that have really extreme depth perception, they manifest the symbols that are present in perception outward into the world (this happens all the ttime to me). so when, jack swoops in and rose falls in love with a gambler, this is an externalisation of the same symbols -- just replace rose with the bloved amaruca (land of the free, and plumed serpent), and jack with federal reserve all those that put it into place... sepehr has a number of videos on it...

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAPYSeOGoD8)

the federal reserve system, being purely magical, no longer relies on physical laws in order to operate, and so therefore the *probabilities* of that system destabilising, are not longer rooted in reality, but now upon the gamblers' analysis of the situation. so to the rich guy that was betrothed to rose, this signaled the end of the USA -- being carried off by the gamblers, which finally explained something I never understood about the movie, which is why jack had to die (I remember thinking there was enough space for him on the boat or someting), and it's because jack (federal reserve gamblers), had to die so that the rose can continue on.

now the explanation: a similar set of symbols have been happening lately as well. as I mentioned, I identify with rose a bit more than I identify with jack (cause I don't gamble), and the idea of building a matrix in the astral, is exactly the same as the federal reserve. I know that it'll be fine for as long as it's related to me cause I represent physical stablity of attraction/reflection. all things happening in my perception are attracted, and because the "great attractor at the end of time" is what's pulling me toward infinity/eternity, I'm pretty stable. I'm not a gamble(asterisk).

one of the other things that I talked with my father about is death, and I explained to him that death (in a system of attraction and perception) is not at all a big problem. we're here working things out in the physical for the reason of gaining XP (which I define as realising/understnading desire as a reflection of oneself), and so here in these time zones that we're in now, we're in the middle of all of our *own* perceptions externalised about why that desire is not realised as a manifestaiton oneself (I AM ... that I thought I needed/wanted to feel good). therefore, when one dies, the resistance that one has toward that realisation goes away instantly, and you can become everything that you thought you could be. so, death is actually a good thing.

death and the desire tto hang on to reality for longer than necessary is kind of like playing a game, and so because you can't beat the boss in that level, you just sit outside the boss door and wait for him to go away (obviously he never does), so you wait forever. just die, get a new perspective and try again until you finally get it. then later, if you want to perfect/optimise your run, you can get better and better at beating it.

the other thing that I explained is that th way that one perceives others' deaths (grief and anguish) is just a reflection of how attached one is to the current level. so, for someone like me, who doesn't have much to prove anymore (polly cause I've already beat the level a few times and am just optimising/improving technique), I don't really feel death to be such a big deal (you have to lose your life tto gain it) -- but then again, if I'm not that worried about dying myself, maybe that increases the gamble. something to worry about, for sure :)

---

the next thing that I noticed when talking to dad, is that I mentioned that I noticed that I had a giant hole in my head where a pineal gland was located. it seems to me, this is probably why I don't have an imagination. though, it's a "disadvantage" to not have a way to visualise concepts, I've come to really like it, so much that I want to make it physiologically impossible for me to see images. I also want to eliminate the possiblity for kundalini to rise. I didn't really understand why that was until after talking with dad.

you see, all of dad's gambling ideas, goals, and aspirations are all located in the (2nd ray) pineal gland area, so instead of "seeing" these desires/fears inside of my head from the pineal gland, instead (because I don't have one), I manifest all of these 2nd ray aspects out into my physical space so that I can interact with these concepts. they show up as real people, bands, songs, ideas, and is the reason why my reality is so narrative. the 2nd ray perspective is one of narrative, because we have on top all of the desires that are going into the goals and aspirations, and then on bottom there is the symbolic reality of how things work (the solar regime, as interpretted by the automaton), and that produces a number of perspectives looking back into *history* (epimethian perspective). epimetheus' perspective combines with desires, and that creates the promethian perspective -- which is, a series of probabilities and rightness, which then produces a very high frequency (prolly past UV) picture which makes a feeling that cascades down to the spectral and astral.

well, I don't see those pictures, so all of those feelings which would be turned to pictures, turn into real-life people. zaryn was clearly the externalisation of dad's percption that busniness and making money is a gamble. all aspects of my big-picture reality have become real people and things which I've interacted with (like chris, zaryn, luke, ryan, etc.).

the thing is, I'm pretty good at finding my way back to feeling good, so even if I interact with them, I get right back going toward "the great attractor at the end of time", and so I'm literally here (kind of like a speedrun) to optimise that perception by interacting with these feelings made manifest so that I can realise that desire as a reflection of myself.

### 2023-03-18 21:39 - the whole world is watching

a few weeks ago, I ate some weed and because I felt a lot better than usual, I seemed to find this group on youtube called "within temptation" -- and I was super enthralled with their performance, because they had these super great songs like "mother earth" which were very signifiant because I was just (at that time) figuring out how the 1-7 reflection chamber of the planet works (it's kinda like a star) and how that connects to DNA and stuff -- so I was just starting out there. it was easy for me to see that our bodies are like machines, reflective of our desire -- however, I wouldn't be able to actually communicate the [thought into english](/sledge-notes.md#2023-03-14-2312---lilith-venus-mixup) till some days later -- and even then, it's [quite a vague concept](/sledge-notes.md#2023-03-15-0004---explain-more-please) but it seems to make more sense when I explain it as [a force called YHVH](/sledge-notes.md#2023-03-16-1112---metatron-and-channeling), and not literally your cells and body a reflection of your desire; you'll likely hear me talk about it again in many different ways now because the "mother earth" way is no longer available.

anyway, so the night I (essentially moved timelines to a  different one with them on it) my computer stopped playing videos and I was forced to quit youtube for a while -- and I went to sleep as well. so when I look at the same concert again just now, the part I watched is mostly the same, and some of the lyrics are a little different -- but it's funny because they even consider that song as something they didn't really intend to make:

> The sound of Mother Earth was a departure for the band.

so then they have this song at the end of the world (which I swear had different lyrics before my computer stopped working), which has strange lyrics. it used to be singing (seemingly about me), and how all of you are all watching. now, the lyrics tell a very different story:

    You live your life, you go day by day
    Like nothing can go wrong
    Then scars are made, they're changing the game
    You learn to play it hard

    And I know you wish for more
    And I know you try
    And I hope you realize
    You know the time is right

    The whole world is watching when you rise
    The whole world is beating free right now
    Your whole life is flashing for your eyes
    It's all in this moment that changes all
    What are you waiting for?
    What are you fighting for?
    'Cause time's always slipping away
    The whole world is watching
    The whole world is watching you when you rise

    You build your walls then break them away
    'Cause that is what it takes
    You saved yourself, you found who you are
    That never goes away

    And I know you wish for more
    And I know you try
    And I hope you realize
    You know the time is right

    The whole world is watching when you rise
    The whole world is beating free right now
    Your whole life is flashing for your eyes
    It's all in this moment that changes all
    What are you waiting for?
    What are you fighting for?
    'Cause time's always slipping away
    The whole world is watching
    Yeah, the whole world is watching you when you rise

    Your sacrifice goes through your mind
    But nothing is wasted, you've made it now
    You rise again, breaking out
    Each step that you've taken, you've paid the price

    The whole world is watching
    The whole world is watching
    The whole world is watching you when you rise

    What are you waiting for?
    What are you fighting for?
    'Cause time's always slipping away
    The whole world is watching
    Yeah, the whole world is watching you when you rise

the lyrics now tell a story of "the time is slipping away" (as if there's nothing I can do about it) and "each step you've taken, *you've paid the price*" (as if I have money), "what are you waiting for?" (as if I'm waiting), and "what are you fighting for?" (as if I'm fighting)

so here's the thing: you can manifest your timeline however you want to manifest it and see me however you want to see me. enjoy your manifestation.

anyway, do your worst, because you're not really fighting me. you know that the thing I've been asking for and wanting this whole time has been some real food-draggers.

it doesn't seem logical at first to anyone that thinks in terms of the "first", but from the perspective of one who sees from the "last", it's absolutely *normal* that everyone else is doing all of the cool stuff before me ("And I know you wish for more").

it looks (to you) like you're dragging me down
by not letting me have all that I wish,
but every centre has as many ahead, as lost left behind.I'm neither the first or the last,
but both at the same time.

from my perspective, you're keeping me alive.
if I were to go any faster I'd sieze my existance;
not physical no more.

you know, it's only because of your inability
to feel good about your circumstance,
that you can still find a way to manipulate
your timeline so you can still perceive me.

you're still hanging on to me:
[you're the reason I cannot fly](/ode-to-myself.md#2023-03-18-1924---youre-the-reason-i-cannot-fly).

you know, as soon as I can perceive wanted
in all of its entirety,
there will be no more ways to adjust your perception
to see me anymore.

I exist (for you) as long as you can find fault
in my perception (which is really yours).

if it takes me
another thousand years
[of repeating that](/ode-to-myself.md#2023-03-18-1935---so-everything-is-fine),
over and over again,
you're giving me
another thousand years
to be alive.

every time I see it
better and better,
you're perfecting me the same.
