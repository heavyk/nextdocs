# metal lucifer

this blog is dedicated to writing about consciousness and other subjects that interest me while listening to metal and other dissonant things.

the contrast between the brilliance in my thoughts and the landscape of the music is delightful. however, I find it very difficult to carry on my thoughts while they talk, so I usually take a pause at that time and just listen to their studio jabber.

this is a totally crazy experience so far. I want to explore a new area of self-sacrifice and dissonance here.

inspired by seriah azkath.. listening to "last exit for the lost"

### 2022-06-18 22:18 - metal lucifer

I listened to snake-bros #099 - seriah azkath today and it totally blew my mind. he's really smart -- and I bet that's from being kinda plunged into a hyper attraction from his "morbid kundalini" experience going through puberty.

I had basically the opposite thing happen for me. I can't really remember what life was like before the brain haemorrhage now, but it seems to me that I saw in 4d and I got the sense that I may have had the kundalini risen since a very early age. attraction was fast so I think that's why I ended up with the brain haemorrhage, because I had serious emotional outbursts.

anyway, after listeneing to the show he plugged his show, "last exit for the lost" which has a bunch of metal music on it. I haven't listened to metal music in quite a long time. some of the songs transport me into a whole nother landscape. it's difficult to explain because each song is like this epic trip through a foreign space, then he starts talking in the studio and I have no idea what he's talking about because I don't know any of these bands really.

I just love the constantly changing landscape that these metal songs provide. I just went to the bathroom and when I got in there and just thinking to myself, all of a sudden all of the reactions to the stuff I previously wrote today start to come rushing back in, so I wanted to try and see what would happen if I were to try and write about that with metal playing. it's a bit of a collision of realities right now, but I'm gaining clarity quickly. so here goes...

I wrote about bigfoot, but in order to get my concept across, I had to connect up a lot of disperate ideas I had written about previously into a cohesive narrative of why I think that bigfoot, fae, and grey aliens are all connected and members of the conceptual plane, projecting downward (or, from our perspective, we're perceiving a shadow or an consciously compatible instatiation of a "concept") -- and the weird thing is that's kinda what seriah was saying in the show.

it seems that he's pretty sensitive, so that sorta stuff is perceivable by him (same with joshua, which I didn't know but is apparently a regular(?) on his show), and so all of that is really cool. I'm very impressed that someone out there is putting these phenomena together and looking at it through the astral lens. he briefly explains that his girlfriend and him could see the multi-coloured point lights in the graveyard, and said that we all see things differently, but that's where he left it.

because I'm kind of avoiding the astral plane, I have so many questions for him (or joshua who also clearly knows something about it). I've only been a member of the astral plane for maybe a total of about 20-50h (hard to say because a lot of that time was watching stars or on drugs) over the course of about 20 experiences or so, so I don't have nearly as much experience as he does.

man, I *really* wish I knew some of these types of people to talk to sometimes. anyway, that's not what I wanted to talk about...

for example, I can explain the tree moving for two guys but not the other... when I had my brain haemorrhage, I would move my arm and I would see it move, but I assure you I was not moving my arm because it was paralysed. I even pushed myself up off of the floor and saw my eyesight altitude off of the floor, but still I assure you I wasn't moving. there came a sudden realisation that I was still on the ground. it took a while for my brain to realise that I was still on the ground, because I was seeing the reality simulation in my head, not reality itself.

you see, the time it takes for signals to get to the brain is way too slow for anyone to have instant movement, so the brain has a complete model of reality and and you move around in it instantly have full sensation and everything. the imagination is an extremely good simulator of reality (you can do experiments in your mind) and so when you're looking out in your eyes, you're not actually seeing reality. everyone is seeing their imagination, and then when the brain gets a signal the contradicts the model, it error corrects.

if you look at something in your imagination, you'll notice that there is a space between you and what you're looking at (this is normal 4d). what happens when the kundalini rises (at least for me) is my vision now starts to look like my imagination does and there's a space between me and what I'm looking at. this means that I can see feel, touch (all of the senses) all of these physical objects now *as if they were imaginary objects*, so that makes all of the senses feel more enhanced and everything.

seriah also gave the example of anonymous consciousness getting rendered by the mind as a thing and so then it sticks, so the next guy looking at that bit of consciousness would be more likely to see it as a whatever the last guy saw it as. so if that consciousness talks to you, you can easily see it talking and hear the words, but other people not tuned into that will see or hear it. this includes all senses, so the ground vibrating from the tree shaking doesn't seem at all out of the realm of possibility. many things happen to me in dreams that feel much more dramatic than that in dream space (also astral) and my body wasn't moving then either.

the simulation that everyone is talking about is inside of your brain. we're just interpretting data (vibrations) into more and more "real" things. a part of the brain fails and this is extremely apparent, trust me :)

OK, so in @[random-thoughts](2022-06-18 11:31), I talked about how alalu/lucifer was originally the guy that decided to leave the power structure and do things his own way, but he was so successful at it, I believe for many reasons, he decided to start creating consciousness designed to defeat himself.

I explained how there were probably a lot of entites that joined him in his endeavours out on tiamat, and these were mostly entites from the tech civs that just like good conditions (there's nothing wrong with that).

so you have the power structure over on mars that have a superiority complex, and I think that was an intentional thing. I don't know how much I believe the whole "INFECTED ONES" narrative, honestly. reason is because I'm pretty sure alalu created tons of awful entites (demons or whatever in this conceptual realm) and also a whole lot of martians as well that were real difficult guys designed to keep alalu down and they were designed with power and superiority complex designed to keep and endless power struggle going on between the various factions. over the time the weaker factions were "destroyed" but because you can't really kill something that's eternal, they just lost their physical bodies and had to keep trying to get back into physical bodies by manipulating the astral realm.

the astral is a mix of physical and conceptual (like I esplained above). so in order for these conceptual entities to get back into bodies (to be able to interact with the physical again), they have to trick people capable of percieving the astral plane, and then we do the reality creation -- meaning that any physial effects that happen in the physical are all created by us. if the wind blows, that could be just your model but it could start to take an effect on reality (just like cloud busting), but if more than one person experiences the same thing it enhances that effect in physical reality even more.

I believe therefore that most of these entities are masters at finding ways to get humans to create the reality they want for theirselves (both the incarnated ones and the disincarnate ones alike).

consciousness is a weird thing and I think that a lot of the "pultergeist" stuff is just people manifesting their emotions into reality, which, like he said is why it mostly happens to pubescent kids, mostly the girls in difficult situations or settings. I can say from my experiences that they were all directly correlated with the emotion I felt in that setting.

oops, derailed again... still didn't get to talking about what I wanted to talk about which was lucifer/alalu.

I believe that he's basically playing a game where he's trying to do the impossible (or at least I think it's impossible), so that's why I pose the question: do you think it's always possible to defeat yourself?

if you had unlimited access to put thoughts into your head and to rearrange timelines so that you have constantly appearing people trying to thwart your efforts, do you believe that you could defeat yourself infinitely?

I believe it's possible to do. if it's not possible, that'd be a pretty interesting revelation to find out what is the weak link, and then once that's figured out what are the possibilites to try and improve the physical apparatus that's weak? I'm fairly certain that the weak link probably is going to be something physical, because in all of the layers above it, you can just do a simple transformation to find out the opposite frequency. now, how that manifests here in the physical will not be that perfect opposite frequency; it'll have imperfections and limitations to it so a more rapid method of manifestation will be necessary -- a method to manifest physical reality at the speed of thought.

here's another idea to think about: if the atlantians had the capability to manifest reality instantly and time machines to rewind time back (to undo any mistakes), do you think they could have held off the catalcysm infinitely?

what I mean is, I'm sure that it's possible to continually come up with technologies that can dampen the earth vibrations, and so if they had some sort of genius that was able to continually come up with ways to dampen the vibrations in the earth at the speed of thought, would it be possible?

strangely, for this one, I think not. it seems to me like they could go for really long but then there would be some sort of limit that is reached with the output of the sun, meaning that the sun is eventually putting out such powerful energy to make the feeling of those on earth manifest, that eventually it would have to happen.

so, maybe the first one isn't possible either -- but it seems to me like a really cool idea because if I could self-sabotage myself enough, eventually instant manifestaton would be possible, and that would be really cool.

OK, I'm done. my resume of this is, I definitely have a lot of distortion in my thoughts when listening to metal -- and I feel really weird the whole way too. I'll probably do it again cause it's so fascinating. I'm writing about the nature of consciousness and then seriah comes on and gives the other guy in the studio a bit about how he needs a lap dance and how much porno everyone should have. it's a total mind trip. anyway...

### 2022-06-19 00:00 - one more thing about metal lucifer

I totally derailed my original idea for the entry (I don't really know why it keeps happening -- I'll get better at this) because I didn't talk about the reaction to @[random-thoughts](2022-06-18 11:31).

there were various reactions to it and the one that felt most from nosebook was a feeling of unknowing what to do -- because they're so used to pushing against people, what on earth are they going to do if I keep self-sabotaging? what I mean is, if I'm focused on unwanted and if they too are focused on unwanted, they need an offset. they're only able to focus on unwanted because many humans are uaually trying to figure out how to get wanted stuff, so that kind of puts them into a weird spot where they have to find a way to get people to look at wanted to offset their own perception of unwanted.

it's a good thing that compartmentalisation exists because I think it's going to be hard for them to look at unwanted and wanted at the same time.

---

the other reaction that was present is so hard to get to with this music playing it's nearly impossible. I remember it had something to do with the idea of ... OH, that's right. I wrote about how in the story of alalu, the martians couldn't allow alalu to do so well, so they tried to be the superior and were forced to destroy lucifer/alalu.

so, the story of lucifer that's in dtp is that he's a magnificent being of light but he was too ambitious and his over ambition is what caused his destruction. that's kinda the opposite of the story I told.

the other story of lucifer that I've heard is the one where he's very proud and wants to elevate himself above "God" and so because of his pride, "God" (enlil) had to put him down to a more humble level.

this is the story that I was getting reactions to, because I'm essentially proposing that alalu just wanted to do his own thing but he lives in a reality with others that can't allow him to create anything that he wants, so they choose to bring him down to his level.

---

well, like I said, I don't really think that's the case. I think that enlil was created by alalu. also, like tesla and also jesus, I believe he was successful in his creation, but realised that unwanted is the same as wanted, so instead of trying to destroy the opponent or prevent the creation from being destroyed, why not continually make more and more formidable opponents that he designs to defeat himself? each iteration he'll get more and more powerful and each and every time he defeats himself, he benefits by gaining more power.

either lucifer really is a super arrogant power-hungry guy and he's in an infinite loop trying to defeat himself, or it's quite possible that there's something bigger going on here.

the channeled "et view of creation" by kuthumi has an interesting tidbit in part one:

> This prior Universe that existed and grew and matured and then passed through the transition. And so, *just as now*, we of the hierarchy of this planet, joined with the hierarchies of other planets and the cosmic council, are working for *the maturation of this Universe*.

the channeler here (the same one telling the story about the "INFECTED ONES") is claiming that this universe is getting so big that it's ready to get this universe ready for its maturation, death and rebirth. the way he explains the "rebirth of the universe" is like this:

> When you think of the transition, a small scale of that transition would be what you refer to as a super nova. You can imagine a super nova multiplied by a factor of ten to the trillion; you will have the magnitude of the transition energy of the prior Universe.

so you thought the younger dryas was a big catastrophe, wait till you see the one that causes the rebirth of the universe. the way I see this happening is basically the same setup that the atlantians had going on. you get a bunch of people dissatisfied with current conditions with the technology to try and prevent the catastrophe for as long as possible. they'll setup a system that creates the conditions that they want, but with the continuing dissatisfaction, it'll eventually create a nova that is very large.

you can see that in order to do that, you'll need something much larger than just a single star and planet. what I postulate that needs to happen to make such a large supernova would probably be a whole galaxy or a cluster of galaxies. if a normal star is going supernova is 10^1000000000000 times weaker, then that means that every star in an average galaxy needs to nova 10^10000 times larger than it normally does ... that's pretty big. I have no idea what could possibly do this, but I think you just take the basic "american way" of doing things to this galaxy idea -- just replicate it on a galactic scale and then replicate that. compartmentalise and conquer.

so what I mean is, I believe that we don't just need one lucifer, but hundreds of billions of lucifers. we've got to figure out a way to pump out lucifers -- guys that are willing to self-sabotage theirselves until they run up against physical limits. we'll just keep creating more opponents for ourselves until the whole universe can no longer hold it back anymore -- max disaster.

that's my theory on what's happening
