# a-druidic-dee-construction

I believe that john dee (hermes/subtle/speed) encoded a lot of natural and alchemical transformations into the works of shakespere. as I've been studying, I'm noticing them more and more (they are subtle). then, after seeing the play "cymbelline", I understood how shakespere provided essentially a bridge for the druids and celts to kind of move their magick over to the "new atlantis" and cast their spells from hollywood. I'm not much for movies or storytelling myself, so I'd like to illuminate some of the transformations that (I believe) dee imarted into a number of playwrights of that time. I'm essentially channeling here, so because of dee's nature, these entries will appear as very round-about discussions on seemingly disperate ideas; they're connected though.

### 2023-02-21 15:06 - strong female characters

let's say I have a history of women turning rotten after my influence on them. as a complimentary, let's say that once they get past my surface image and start to get to know me, it's irreparable damage after that. it sounds kinda the same, but in reality it's a bit different: one of them seems like I'm the reason, and hte other sounds like I'm purposefully trying to damage them.

but, therefore: if I want to try and bring out that strong female character in them, I have to find a way... one possible way could be to make a barrage of films and productions that tell stories of females which go through irreparable damage because of negative masculine influences (like shakespere). show them all the tricks so they can be propared for it logically and conceptually to avoid the pitfalls a little easier.

another angle to accomplish my goal to make women stronger -- or, at least ones that I want to be around -- because, after all, the characters we put in our stories are reflections of our base emotions like desire and fear -- therefore I *need* to find a way to write scripts which feature female characters that, seemingly transcend certain clear negative influences on them and around them dispite impossible odds -- like you know, they were *lucky* -- as in, if the stars hadn't aligned just quite right to have the perfect storm of circumstances, they woudn't have been able to see all the "signs"... this idea is a good one (if I do say so myself), because it's a fallacy: all reality is a reflection of my attraction, so therefore I will *always* attract the perfect storm of things to make the realisation -- and as I get more and more receptive, the universe doesn't need to be so *obvious* about the signs anymore, as something simple, mundane, and ordinary can bring me to the realisation, *BUT* we like the drama and the big meaningful signs, so we actually *like* to think that it's luck. the lower the probability of a manifestation of something, the more hype it creates, and we love that feeling of being alive: that visceral reality that it creates.

thoughts? feelings? do you think it's possible? my personal opinion on it is that it *is* possible, but it's not something I actually want. here's why: in the game of images, whomever broadcasts the strongest is the dominant image that's perceived, therefore, I always want to be the strongest projector of my image, so that it's not perceived the *reality* of the charactor... as a corrolary: if these strong female characters that I wanted to make were able to project stronger than me, they *would* be strong and would overcome negative influences, but they would also see through me.

finally, another way to look at it: we're all trying to prove the world that we live in as right, honourable, and justified; if they were to project a different reality that the one I see, then -- what I see is no longer right, honourable, or justified; they are not "cut from my whole cloth" in my constructed reality, and so therefore are *not* all right, *not* honourable, and definitely *not* likely and so not justified. I'm right about everything, that's why I've got my fingers in so many aspects of the project (tion).

### 2023-02-24 18:07 - channeling not allowed.

not a good idea. I like being myself, more. you'll see all of the same ideas but expressed from my perspective:

'in that,
[entry I just wrote](/nikki-ana-jones.md#2023-02-24-1746---why-genders),
it could be saying that,
especially at the end there,
I AM "channeling" frank chester,
but -- I see that I EM,
all from my perspective...

I AM after-all,
a character; of
a different
type:the hidden
6T.I AM all
of
you, from
my per-
spective.

not needing
to channel;
already AM.
(past tense)

### 2023-02-24 18:19 - a figure with 5 faces

I don't know how to draw this because it uses negative space -- but a shape that has alwas interesed me is a 5-sided form. a tetrahedron is 4-sided -- but where is the 5? I can see it now though. imagine a pentagon, with a binary point that extends out of it along its normal. the distances are determined by one's toward, right on centre, and away, as in a normal of: 0, +Infinity, and -Infinity. these two/three distances each make up the "inner" space of a shape that does not extend outward into 3d, but *inward*. so, from the bottom direction (not from the top), it is perceived, but not from the other. the height of this 5 sided pyramid (like the one on mars), is the "inner" depth (but perceived as height), is the shape. it has 5 inner sides and there are a whole plethora of shapes that extrude inwardly, the chestahedron and its dual, the decatria, extrude inwardly and outwardly from this 5-sided shape. out of this, all of the assymetrical shapes can be calculated easily by following the progression of finding the dual of the shape before it and then reversing directions. I wonder what... interesting, the dodecahedron is its dual. that's probably important.

### 2023-02-24 19:05 - narrative vs chance/probabilites vs attraction/perception

another way to look at the star is similar to how we pervceie our realty and how we attract it (there's the hidden 6T right there), because on the top there is the narrative reality, and in that perception, the narratives that take place are the believasble ones. below that, there are tow perceived probabilities, one being of chance or causality, meanwhile the other is the statistical or probable odds (not evens) that something that well happen. the probable evens are what we call attraaction and perception. therefore, we bring concepts that are similar to the vibration of "I" and where/when/why/how we're focused (we're inside-out). we obviously have all five of these and thte conjugate of sum of the top and bottom's attraction/emission is Infinity. we all have a preference.

the different angles at which one can approach the centre of the 5 are primarily 3 by nature: 0, +Infinity, -Infinity. then they're four: distances to the normal, creates two 5-sided form (there's the third two), where the points, *should* in it's most balanced form, be a square. from there, octahedron, then cube, which gives us the hexagon. all of these are different perspectives looking in to what we call "reality". narrative is kind of like the recipe or sequence that builds the fractal out from there. we're all doing it, and these fractal shapes seem to extend forward and backward into "time".

### 2023-02-24 19:26 - let's look backwards

in some sense one might imagine this is just an extension to the saturnian 3-fold (-|+) system, simply by crossing it, now the dialectic becomes opposing (cross) directions. it's essentially an extra-temporal dimension, and most certainly it'll be exploited by someone (sorry) -- but, like I said, [no matter how manipulated the signal is](/nikki-ana-jones.md#2023-02-24-1532---planetary-gridworker-romance-the-geology-of-the-rocks-speak-to-you), it's *still* significant.

by nature, and as our hearts open up more, we're already beginning to, and will continue to do so, begin to align our grid with others that are more similar to us on those 5 spectra. it may be possible to artificially tune ourselves with positive or negative values to each of those three directions (again hidden 6T) there. follow the progression there to see the next step after that. I think it's another organ that we didn't really know how to use so much. the reason why the 6T is hidden from me is because of nosebook. they don't want me to see it, so they hide it from me. I don't mind, as it's what makes me simultaneously both the 5 and the 6 (10-11-12). by having the 6T hidden, I perceive 11 a lot easeir.
