### 2022-07-19 04:33 - first impressions of him and his meditation technique

I just binge watched a nearly all of the video interviews available on [new thinking allowed with jeffrey mishlove](https://www.youtube.com/c/NewThinkingAllowed). I have so many thoughts, and I wanted to get some out now initially before they vanish.

I find his material very very compelling, cept for maybe a few critisisms -- which I believe he should apply some of his own 8 steps to change to his own beliefs (one of which is the ability to give up on some preconceived ideas). anyway, other than that I really really like it.

I want to use this document here to develop some of my thoughts before I eventually write him. I've also been thinking that I want to try his meditation for a little bit before writing him as well. he says that focused intention is what makes results. I don't doubt him on that, so having the same view myself, I think it's a great idea to begin to be more rigourous and focused with my intention.

the reason why I want to write this experiment is that historically, I've found intention to be very anti-productive for me. I perform his 8 steps to change, seemingly with little effort, and for me it's really only 2 steps: feel good so I can receive the inspiration, then iterate on the presentation of that information until it's capable of being received by others.

so, for me, it's all about reception. the other steps like being able to give up on preconceived ideas are obvious, because it's those ideas that are preventing me from receiving it in the first place. later on, in the presentation phase, I've realised that I can get the feeling and it feels like I know it perfectly, but the very act of having te translate it into words, ideas and/or symbols that others can understand illuminates aspects of the concept that I didn't previously consider when it was just a feeling or concept in my emotional centre. iterating on the presentation is the focusing mechanism which helps me improve on the idea and throw out parts that eventually turn out to not sound as well as I thought they did in the beginning iterations.

oops derailed... therefore, this experiment of trying to set focused intention for me has it's foundation in the convincing idea that in his meditation, he has 4 words that are *felt*, and this is an activation of desire for that physical reality. it's sort of like remote viewing yourself in the future, now. that means, it's a process of reception, so I like it and want to try it. I set intention to receive things all the time and it's successful, so this should be no different.

- pick a space to meditate in and a time to do it
    - optional if you're experienced.
    - it's there to build a habit, stable meditation framework, or a mental structure, if you don't already have one
- pick a phase that's essentially your direction
- pick 4 words:
    - physical word
    - emotional word
    - spiritual word
    - mental word

- sit down comfortably with straight spine and think the phrase.
- there will be nothing for a time until a thought bubbles up.
    - if the thought is in alignment with the phrase, then think it.
    - if a feeling shows up and it's in alignment with the phrase, feel it.
    - repeat for the duration of the 20m meditation
- at the end, picture yourself and say to your yourself your  physical word.
    - don't just think it; feel it.
    - repaat for the emotional word, the spiritual word, and the mental word.
    - all of these words are to be felt as if you have them presently just as you desired them.

### 2022-07-19 04:54 - is the future fixed?

in a number of his latest interviews regarding the remote viewing 2060, he's stated many times that one of the things he wants to see if he can prove with data is if the future is fixed or not.

in the edgar cayce interview, he stated that a number of the people requesting a reading on atlantis influenced the reading with their own beliefs. he states that that what we believe effectively in this realm of information can be perceived as reality.

personally, my belief is that all reality is a reflection of the way we conceptualise it to be. so, for example, if a person is in the present is *not* considering catastrphic climate change to be something that the future holds, and so if nobody ever comes to tell them that it's a thing, then their current trajectory (assuming no external factors alter the course of history) is that their remote viewing of the future will not include that reality.

I feel the confusion. to try and explain this, let me reverse the idea: if my perception is one discord and that people need to do things differently, then I'm attracting a future that feels like that. you can imagine that if the global consciousness of the earth feels that things need to be done differently, the planet itself will reflect that in what we would call catastrophic climate change.

however, imagine that if the majority (or even only 10%) of the people on the planet had a sense of beingness that was non-resistant, non-violent and not needing to change, the climate (which is like the british in the indian independence) will keep trying to push through a change, but it we're not resisting the change, then eventually reality will restructure itself to accomodate our beingness of non-resistance.

in short, what I'm saying is that I believe that "catastrphic climate change" is a reflection of our perception that we need to push through some changes. some want it one way and others want it a different way, and both sides are so sure they're right about what's best (just like the "right way" to meditate or remote view), that the climate change is just a reflection of our need for things to be different than how they are.

oops, I opened up the can of worms. I can feel so many things that came up from that... let's start from the top.

I'd like to propose a mental idea: what if ghandi didn't have the intention of trying to push through independence, and instead, without any intention, he just taught beingness, not as a means to an end, but simply for the well-being of the indians.

the indians, in the process of feeling more and more well-beingness, would eventually become incompatible with the british taxes, and so just like they gave up the fight, the change in consciousness would change the way that the british interacted with the indians. nobody can actually take advantage of somebody that doesn't feel taken advantage of.

that's the whole goal of this meditation: to get good at feeling those words as if they're already reality, and when they do, that's when they "go flat" and lose their pertinent desire (you don't desire the thing you already have). so, if you cultivate a beingness of well-being in a sufficient population that cascades out to a point where you eventually *have* well-being, and so therefore at some point that goes flat because your reality now has that well-being so it's no longer desired.

you can try to promote this well-beingness for others, but -- it's best to just practise it yourself, for that's far more effective and has more long-lasting results than pushing for something.

I know I sound strange saying this, but I would have done what ghandi did differently. I think he was pushing for change a little bit too hard instead of receiving it. it's possible that the future difficulties that india experienced later on were actually a result of pushing against the british instead of letting the british make the decision to leave by theirselves (ie receive the change as a reflection of beingness).

actually, that feels good for now. good night.

### - perception vs information
  - if you perceive yourself as a thing,

### - magnetic field may be the medium whereby the "random" becomes less random
### - pinning the future -- again as a reflection of the person's perception
