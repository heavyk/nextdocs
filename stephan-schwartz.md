# stephan schwartz

- pick a space to meditate in and a time to do it
    - optional if you're experienced.
    - it's there to build a habit, stable meditation framework, or a mental structure -- if you don't already have one
- pick a phrase that's the direction you want to take your focus
- pick 4 words:
    - physical word
    - emotional word
    - spiritual word
    - mental word

- sit down comfortably with straight spine and think the phrase.
- there will be nothing for a time until a thought bubbles up.
    - if the thought is in alignment with the phrase, then think it.
    - if a feeling shows up and it's in alignment with the phrase, feel it.
    - repeat for the duration of the 20m meditation
- at the end, picture yourself and say to your yourself your physical word.
    - don't just think it; feel it.
    - repeat for the emotional word, the spiritual word, and the mental word.
    - all of these words are to be felt as if you have them presently just as you desired them.

### 2022-07-19 04:33 - first impressions of him and his meditation technique

I just binge watched a nearly all of the video interviews available on [new thinking allowed with jeffrey mishlove](https://www.youtube.com/c/NewThinkingAllowed). I have so many thoughts, and I wanted to get some out now initially before they vanish.

I find his material very very compelling, cept for maybe a few critisisms -- which I believe he should apply some of his own 8 steps to change to his own beliefs (one of which is the ability to give up on some preconceived ideas). anyway, other than that I really really like it.

I want to use this document here to develop some of my thoughts before I eventually write him. I've also been thinking that I want to try his meditation for a little bit before writing him as well. he says that focused intention is what makes results. I don't doubt him on that, so having the same view myself, I think it's a great idea to begin to be more rigourous and focused with my intention.

the reason why I want to write this experiment is that historically, I've found intention to be very anti-productive for me. I perform his 8 steps to change, seemingly with little effort, and for me it's really only 2 steps: feel good so I can receive the inspiration, then iterate on the presentation of that information until it's capable of being received by others.

so, for me, it's all about reception. the other steps like being able to give up on preconceived ideas are obvious, because it's those ideas that are preventing me from receiving it in the first place. later on, in the presentation phase, I've realised that I can get the feeling and it feels like I know it perfectly, but the very act of having te translate it into words, ideas and/or symbols that others can understand illuminates aspects of the concept that I didn't previously consider when it was just a feeling or concept in my emotional centre. iterating on the presentation is the focusing mechanism which helps me improve on the idea and throw out parts that eventually turn out to not sound as well as I thought they did in the beginning iterations.

oops derailed... therefore, this experiment of trying to set focused intention for me has it's foundation in the convincing idea that in his meditation, he has 4 words that are *felt*, and this is an activation of desire for that physical reality. it's sort of like remote viewing yourself in the future, now. that means, it's a process of reception, so I like it and want to try it. I set intention to receive things all the time and it's successful, so this should be no different.

### 2022-07-19 04:54 - is the future fixed?

in a number of his latest interviews regarding the remote viewing 2060, he's stated many times that one of the things he wants to see if he can prove with data is if the future is fixed or not.

in the edgar cayce interview, he stated that a number of the people requesting a reading on atlantis influenced the reading with their own beliefs. he states that that what we believe effectively in this realm of information can be perceived as reality.

---

personally, my belief is that all reality is a reflection of the way we conceptualise it to be. so, for example, if a person is in the present is *not* considering catastrphic climate change to be something that the future holds, and so if nobody ever comes to tell them that it's a thing, then their current trajectory (assuming no external factors alter the course of history) is that their remote viewing of the future will not include that reality.

I feel the confusion. to try and explain this, let me reverse the idea: if my perception is one discord and that people need to do things differently, then I'm attracting a future that feels like that. you can imagine that if the global consciousness of the earth feels that things need to be done differently, the planet itself will reflect that in what we would call catastrophic climate change.

however, imagine that if the majority (or even only 10%) of the people on the planet had a sense of beingness that was non-resistant, non-violent and not needing to change, the climate (which is like the british in the indian independence) will keep trying to push through a change, but it we're not resisting the change, then eventually reality will restructure itself to accomodate our beingness of non-resistance.

in short, what I'm saying is that I believe that "catastrphic climate change" is a reflection of our perception that we need to push through some changes. some want it one way and others want it a different way, and both sides are so sure they're right about what's best (just like the "right way" to meditate or remote view), that the climate change is just a reflection of our need for things to be different than how they are.

oops, I opened up the can of worms. I can feel so many things that came up from that... let's start from the top.

---

I'd like to propose a mental idea: what if ghandi didn't have the intention of trying to push through independence, and instead, without any intention, he just taught beingness, not as a means to an end, but simply for the well-being of the indians.

the indians, in the process of feeling more and more well-beingness, would eventually become incompatible with the british taxes, and so just like they gave up the fight, the change in consciousness would change the way that the british interacted with the indians. nobody can actually take advantage of somebody that doesn't feel taken advantage of.

that's the whole goal of this meditation: to get good at feeling those words as if they're already reality, and when they do, that's when they "go flat" and lose their pertinent desire (you don't desire the thing you already have). so, if you cultivate a beingness of well-being in a sufficient population that cascades out to a point where you eventually *have* well-being, and so therefore at some point that goes flat because your reality now has that well-being so it's no longer desired.

you can try to promote this well-beingness for others, but -- it's best to just practise it yourself, for that's far more effective and has more long-lasting results than pushing for something.

I know I sound strange saying this, but I would have done what ghandi did differently. I think he was pushing for change a little bit too hard instead of receiving it. it's possible that the future difficulties that india experienced later on were actually a result of pushing against the british instead of letting the british make the decision to leave by theirselves (ie receive the change as a reflection of beingness).

actually, that feels good for now. good night.

### 2022-07-19 05:37 - first meditation

originally, I thought about these words, but the difficulty for me was the emotional word. I couldn't think of an emotion that I wanted to feel because I'm already so good at feeling what I want...

physical: smoothe
emotional: ???
spiritual: flying
mental: intentional

---

an idea popped into my head to try the experiment in reverse, so I picked four naughty words that I'm going to focus on after spending the entire meditation thinking about knowing what I do want comes immediately after what I don't want. problem solved :)

I decided to put the mental word as intentional, because I don't know how to feel about it, so I wanted to see what comes up. I want to figure out how to integrate intention and reception (though, obviously this entry is full of intention, I may be "polluting the well" with my intention to figure out intention)

phrase: after knowing what I don't want, I'm immediately aware of what I do want.
physical: disabled
emotional: confused
spiritual: arrogance
mental: intention

### 2022-07-19 06:25 - first meditation results

I didn't have much difficulty quieting my mind to focus on the phrase, "as soon as I know what I don't want, *immediately* I know what I do want" -- some of the ideas that came to me were to sign up for the newsletter schwartz report and every night before meditating, focus on those report items and see them as becoming a reality. then, begin the meditation and focus just the same.

the other idea that came to me is to setup a steady time (even though it's exactly opposite of what I normally do), so that others can join me in the meditation, and we can focus our intention together. I can't say what others are going to do, but I'm going to get better and better at powerfully focusing my intention on these things becoming a reality. I noticed it was pretty easy to do. I think it's actually going to be easier without coffee. I noticed that with coffee, I couldn't feel as powerfully as I normally do when I focus.

there was another idea that I can't remember now.

when I got to the part with the words, I felt disabled. I pictured myself with difficulty and stiffness in my leg and arm while trying to walk/run and my left arm while playing pool. I definitely notice a lot more stiffness in my arm and leg since that focus exercise, so it seems to be working.

I went to the emotional one of confusion, felt that for a while. I actually had a difficult time with it because I expereince so much clarity that I had to imagine myself conversing with someone and the interaction itself was the confusing part. I'm going to try and figure out how to improve this one, because I don't at all feel more confused.

I then went to the spiritual word, arrogance. I started feeling it and noticed that I also wanted to feel superior and condescending, pompus and pious. I felt it and it really felt like I was rising up above the ones below me. I was really starting to feel superior to them.

I couldn't remember what the last word was -- and when writing this now, I can't remember what I wanted to think now, so I instead felt my mind as very rigid and sluggish. though it was an iron box, I asserted its rigidity on those around me and forced them into my mental jail and caused them to drag around this box like a weight. I felt a light open up in the middle of my head, and a doughnut shaped thing started to eminate around my head and it really felt like I was asserting this mental state onto those around me. it felt very effective and powerful.

I then noticed that I couldn't feel disabled anymore because I was so superior to everyone now. I didn't know how to integrate my superiority complex into the same space. I choose (apparentely) to return to disability because I feel stiffness, and not really at all superior. to get the superiority complex, I'm probably going to have to take on a super hotshot posture and movement regime to be able to maintain that feeling of superiority.

### 2022-07-19 22:21 - thinking about what happened

I looked into the concept[^1], and it seems that what happened is when I was writing down the words, I wrote down "smoothe" and "flying" was thinking about the last two words, but I was getting this sense that I shouldn't put words that will cause a manifestation -- or cause things to get too easy. I remembered my commitment to go all the way to the end without a manifestation or kundalini rising, and it felt as if I shouldn't be picking words that would make things better.

I gave up trying to come up with words that I wanted, because I didn't really know what I wanted, so I decided I would go with unwanted -- because I know that unwanted produces wanted.

I picked my words, and then just now I noticed that when I was saying them at the end of the meditation, I could feel their "we need to remain superior" kinda vibe when I was feeling the disabled word (kinda like, "yeah, he's choosing disability. allright, we're on top"). confusion was difficult for me to conjure effectively but when I got to arrogance, that's when I really began to start to feel the superiority thing start to rise up really strong. I believe I was, to some extent, channeling my "angels(?)" -- dunno the right term for them.

by the time that I had taken on their vibration and began to assert myself as some super hotshot (just like how they feel), I couldn't at all remember the last word, intention. it was completely inaccessable. so, instead I just went with the feeling that I had which was (huh, now I can't get to it) -- rigid iron box mentality and sluggish dragging all of that extra weight around.

I was just channeling these guys.

---

as a result, I was thinking today, if I would try and medittate in the positive direction, as in what I wanted -- but like I said, I don't really want to have any manifestations, and just that little bit of meditating (even focusing myself on unwanted thoughts), my visual capacity started to open up quite a bit because of it. I didn't push it to keep going, but I could have started to project the little bouncing balls of fun that take on the shape of the music out of my eyes into 3d space for everyone to see (like I did that one time a long time ago when smoking with francisco at vera's house -- I believe it was 3-11 -- the day of the madrid bombs).

I could just go toward wanted stuff, or I could just keep going the unwanted route. the reaction that I got about that was reminding me of neo in the matrix after he starts to see the world in code and he's so busy showing off his powers to the agents that the nebu-chad-nezzar  (chad for short) get nearly destroyed by the sentinels, making it a really close call because of chuleria.

it's probably OK, because I'd just been practising to feel chuleria at the end the meditation, so it's all good to go with a few power displays. I'm just reflecting their own vibration back to them, and anyway, I can feel anyway I want to, so it's not like this is a life commitment anyway.

I learned so much from the experience and from the countless reactions afterward, as well. also, today was pretty hot; I wonder if the extra resistance increased the heat.

in any case, I'm going to continue to work on that meditation for a while and see where it takes me.

[1]: shephan does remote viewing of physical things, but I "remote view" concepts theirselves, to try and figure out what was really happening. all the same rules apply, but there are no visuals -- even though I often use visual words to describe it, it's entirely a sense that's kinda difficult to describe -- the most similar maybe "knowing" or remembering something conceptually. I'll try and talk about this more in the future, but as far as I know, I'm the only person that has ever suggested that it's possible to remote comprehend a concept.

### 2022-07-19 22:53 - memory and astral projection

I was talking with mom about astral projection cause she was watching harry potter and talked about how these creatures are probably there, but we can't see them. the discussion devolved into an argument because I didn't see astral projection as a bad thing and she did. I made a statement that, memory, remote viewing or projecting your consciousness into any other position in space or time is astral projection.

therefore, if I were to move my consciousness over to paris right now I can do that even as I'm typing this, but I doubt anyone could possibly see me, cept perhaps maybe a little orb floating around as I have a look around. however, if I were to project an image into some plaza in paris of a bird, it's quite possible that someone sensitive enough to see a strange bird could see the image that I'm projecting.

---

I started to think about memory and how that same thing may be happening. like, if I remember something in my past, and it's "as if I'm there" -- I may be able to smell the smells or to, perhaps if I'm not quite as convinced that the computer in front of me is what I'm looking at, perhaps I'll see it as if I'm there, too.

if that's the case, my projection is the memory itself, and so let's say that it were possible to remove all of the atoms in that moment -- you'd still see the astral image there floating in space. now, if I remembered that same thing, say hundreds of times in my life, there would be hundreds of those images stacked there floating where the atoms once were.

when I was a kid, I remember that my world was very distorted, and I remember having a really difficult time figuring out what's what at times. I had glasses to help me to focus -- but, it occurred to me that perhaps that distortions were actually the astral projections of the future when I was trying to remember things. the distortions are present because as I grew up, the image became smaller and differently shaped because of the effects of memory and changes in perception, so I was seeing hundreds of layers of astral imagery stacked on top of each other.

stephan talkes about numinous[^1] things being easier to see when remote viewing, and so I'm beginning to wonder if the astral plane is sorta like the collective imagination, and in some way, the way that everyone has seen somthing is kinda like stays there as like this thin vapour. the word it'self "numinos" for me conjures an image of clouds or vapour in my mind and it reminds me of nublado. I suspect the word has very ancient roots.

---

so, for example, when I read the book dtp, there was a lot of extra visual data that I couldn't see, but could sense that it was there while reading it -- and in the part with the "special treat" probably also contained visual data as well, so I think that those with astral vision are just tuning into the most powerful image associated with those words -- like that device that phyris gives him to see the image in the author's imagination or the explanation for the painting of the ship sinking.

    It is another example of the power of an occult mind over matter; the artist's will changes the speed of the color, and either reduces or raises it so that the vibrations making red are increased and range up through all degrees of color-force, always exactly in harmony with the astral image put on the canvas by the creative power of the occult artist.

it also reminds me of what I was "seeing" in the matrix 4 resurrections, and the reason why the fights were so hard to follow. it's that extra visual data that people with astral vision can see.

that data is "astral projection". if you can see that, you can remote view. even if you can't see anything, you can remote comprehend (a new term I'm making for RV'ing concepts without visuals) the vibration behind that image.

OH, interesting. I didn't see the connection till just now, but that image of chuleria that I was conjuring last night is very very numinous. that's the illusion.

tonight's meditation is going to be very productive :)

[1]: an interesting word to use because that's zailm's last name and his life, certainly became very numinoso.
