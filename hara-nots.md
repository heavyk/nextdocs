[sara with an h](https://www.youtube.com/@ShakespearewithSarah) (notes). this is a collection of notes and ideas that I have regarding helena.

### 2023-01-12 23:11 - queen hera and helena are the same woman

I just had an epiphany when watching [queen margret](https://youtu.be/6QIMBayfTDI), that queen margret is also queen hera. when realising this, I noticed again a similarity to helena, and that's what I'd like to try and talk about. the thing is, the idea works in my head, but I don't really know how to get it out yet, so what I always do in situations like these is know that a perfect opportunity will manifest soon. it felt like I wanted to listen more about queen margaret (mar). brb.
