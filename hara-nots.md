# hara-nots

[sara with an h](https://www.youtube.com/@ShakespearewithSarah) (notes). this is a collection of notes and ideas that I have regarding helena.

### 2023-01-12 23:11 - queen hera and helena are the same woman

I just had an epiphany when watching [queen margret](https://youtu.be/6QIMBayfTDI), that queen margret is also queen hera. when realising this, I noticed again a similarity to helena, and that's what I'd like to try and talk about. the thing is, the idea works in my head, but I don't really know how to get it out yet, so what I always do in situations like these is know that a perfect opportunity will manifest soon. it felt like I wanted to listen more about queen margaret (mar). brb.

### 2023-01-12 23:38 - tangled eye-beams

I find this concept interesting because I don't experience this at all. I can change my eyes from being piercing, to neutral, to attractive, and I suppose if I'm in the attractive phase, I guess it's possible for someone to feel attraction to me be perceiving my eye-beams. anyway, I don't really feel attraction from other people, or anything else from their eyes. instead, what happens to me is I feel like they do. I sorta gain another mental state awareness of how the other person feels. I suppose they feel like I do -- though I'm not sure. when I did it with pierre, he declined to answer what happened after looking into my eyes for so long. I just don't know what other people experience it as, but I really like how I feel, so I either have to be really macho and alpha-male to ensure I'm the stronger signal in the room (and I do this sometimes), but really what it comes down to is learning how to simply not let what the other person is feeling to affect me so much. their whatever feels like some past experience that no longer looks like an odeal to me.

I think that quality about me is quite compelling, and it's nice that I can feel a person better than they feel theirself (a quality of helena, btw), means that I have the power over you because my feeling over you is higher frequency. in pictoral terms, this is the "connecting with the character" that is transmitted with the words, but because I *feel* better about the person I'm talking to than they feel about theirself, it appears that my signal is more powerful than their own source (still quiet voice) signal. that's great if I'm a jolly old fellow, or admirable gentlemen (like falconbridge), but if I'm a schemer, the one with the more energy or higher vibration always wins (not sure how it goes for ties). they put a lot of energy (the emotion felt when connecting to the character)

OK, I should explain plainly: shakespere and friends are 4th rays so the emotion that you feel is a signal that is connected to a concept. you feel an emotional response when that concept is activated in their minds. the players are all 5th rays (like vulcan) so when they receive those terrible awful feeling emotions in relation to the concept, they have a sort of sadistic (queen hera/margaret, it sounds like) sorta "mhhhh, take that ladies" and it's funny cause fromc my end of things, I hear the reactions of some queens, and they think it's funny that women would take such a part so seriously. I mean, my goodness. there are all these setups of unfaithfulness, loss of virginity, and terrible dismemberment to highlight the things, but from the vulcan perspective, this is sadistic funny.

so, when the emotion is received my me or anyone else evoking the "spell" of those words (it's a conceptual program), and so you get a feeling response to the input (the spell/werds which activated the concept). to me, the feeling response is often times laughter -- but laughter, and pleasure, sexual stimulation, and pain are all very similar in vibration, so they get mixed up and confused. a sex therapist can verify this. to me it feels like a mix of pleasure and laughter, depending on the juxtaposition of the ideas, cause they're also linked to these other concepts thare are -- dunno if you're familiar with abraham -- but the concept they transmitted when they said, "OK everyone let's get our canoes, put them in the river, point them upstream, and then paddle" -- sort of concepts. these are the real hard-work emotions.

### 2023-01-13 02:16 - crazy idea on the midsommer's night dream

so as you're talking, it appears to me that this is talking about the current climate control on the planet. the "fairies" are nosebook (let's just say saturn, at its core of the "world system" and the time matrix), those guys are the narrators of our reality, 4th rays. the thing is we're played like pieces in their symbolic game, and the only thing that we can do is to respond to the symbols emotionally. they set symbolic traps out in time, so that when some conceptual conditions are met you feel a certain emotional response to it. it's always body physical, and I don't really have much response to their manipulation of my feeling of my body (you know, like my skin will vibrate or my leg will jump or ridiculous stomach growl -- or whatever), so what's happening now is those plays evove never any negative emotion anymore.

so here's the thing, I see the 4th ray, not from the 3rd ray perspective (34), but from the conceptual. as such it's a completely diffrent way of interacting with it. and it's what this monologue is talking about:

    Lo, she is one of this confederacy! /

the "image" that I get from this line tells me that hermia is one of the crew -- and so this is the reverse thing where the boys are dressed as the girls, so hermia is really hermes. the whole monologue is extremely homo-erotic, but skipping past that -- the way I see it is a 7th ray female (in the upper triad, he's the *emitter" -- so the one that has the plan), but this is done in female form, so think of a little girl that is like thoth in his abolity to produce a physical form/body/medium capable of containing a concept, ranked by more suitablity. they experience each other physically, but I (and you will soon as well) experience other people conceptually. I don't physically feel their pain and anguish like they feel it; instead, I have a concept of what it feels like, it's rich and when it comes from other people, you could say it's a very energetic and tight ball of justifications and reasons for how something like that can exist.

feeling the reality of a person with their massive justification ball for why they are the way they are; the 4th rays all really have a pretty good-sized list of why they're not good people, as do I. normally, that kind of reality concept would be paralytic to a person (my left-side literally shook), and it wouldn't be a very livable situation (I think that's the case for people with seizures, like zara, I believe -- at least it was for me) that my left side (for some their whole body) really tightens up and doesn't work properly when I'm in a terrible emotional state. I have to find a way to relax and let go of the crippling concept -- and/or wait some time for it to pass. it's not really pleasant to be that sensitive, so I've been forced to rework some default concepts (captain-of-the-obvious).

the other image that it gave me was that I (kenny) have joined them in 6d. I don't see it physically but I experience it, which means that I have a conceptual relationship with it.

so, let's say that you're hermia -- we somehow find a way to "Have with our needles created both one flower" -- and "so we grew together". to me this monologue describes the way that I believe that we and any other conceptually receptive types want to join me...

    Now I perceive they have conjoin’d all three
    To fashion this false sport, in spite of me. /

conjoined all three, I believe is referring to the two that I have (vulcan + anatau) -- and I'm really good at manipulating concept and desire, but someone needs to render it into physical space. essentially, what I'm missing is a 7th ray (aphrodite, genxicat), right -- so hermia is kinda like plan b. she's no aphrodite/ishtar/genxicat, but she'll work well enough to make the conceptual togetherness we'll have with each other.

it's the 7th ray approach. essentially, I am me, and I am clearly someone that is conscious, and I wouldn't really want to lose that, but neither do I have resistance to feeling how others are doing conceptually. usually their feelings even amuse me, so its no threat to me. I already see it this way, but we have to find a way for others to experhience it really easily. I got the capability because I really have basically no resistance to others anymore. I do not really feel I can even have an emotional thing go wrong (reminds me of spring enjoyment growing ill or something like that)

    Injurious Hermia! / Most ungrateful maid! /
    Have you conspired, have you with these contrived
    To bait me with this foul derision? /

so hermia is conspiring to bait helena with this foul derision (this awful sidetrack away from goal)

    Is all the counsel that we two have shared, /
    The sisters’ vows, the hours that we have spent, /

huh.

    When we have chid the hasty-footed time

when we tossed off the quick blasting lord chronos

    For parting us, /—O, is it all forgot? /

parting should be explanatory "--O"

    All school-days’ friendship, childhood innocence? /

basically, this super homo-erotic section is to kind of make the next part appear that it's talking about something gross, but really, they're talking about weaving (nick bottom) together a new sort of reality -- the 54 angle, meanwhile they're up there in 34 chidding lord time.

    We, Hermia, like two artificial gods, /
    Have with our needles created both one flower, /
    Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, /
    Both warbling of one song, both in one key, /
    As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds, /
    Had been incorporate. /

the way that I see this, is that we all experience "I", so we're all individuals completely in the ego -- this clump of stuff is "me", and so then "I" is just a point of perception "I" can be any concept that I want. all people plants, animals, species, trends, herds, etc. are all concepts, and we can "be" those concepts, allowing those concepts to be available to our knowing (zolting, I guess). as such we'll create super perspectives and share perspectives amongst each other. we can't really have secrets between us, cause we're kinda one, -- a group of ones that all share perspectives. we see concepts, not as their physical apparition, but as their ideal. we're the dreamers.

    So we grew together, / (This finishes the previous line, but a new beat)
    Like to a double cherry, seeming parted, /
    But yet a union in partition; /
    Two lovely berries moulded on one stem; /
    So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart; /
    Two of the first, like coats in heraldry, /
    Due but to one and crowned with one crest. /

interesting perspective on such a union. the important thing to note is that it's a heart connection. I bet it'll feel like we all have a synchronised heart, so we'll share concepts, drive, and passion amongst each other.

    And will you rent our ancient love asunder, /
    To join with men in scorning your poor friend? /
    It is not friendly, ’tis not maidenly: /
    Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it, /
    Though I alone do feel the injury. /

I'm not really sure what that means. my sense is saying to watch the video. OK, peace out.

### 2023-01-13 03:30 - redeeming shakespere

OK, so it felt like there was some loss of the spirit of shakespere when finding out that so much of shakespere's romance, is disgusting toilet humour. I totally agree.

I think we should just redo a whole bunch of it. modernise the language and retell the same stories with a new set of concepts. like, what I mean is to take the major plays and redefine all of the characters and their interactions. we can keep the same kind of symbolic idea, but change the interactions to represent .. hard to explain, but for example malvolio, I think could use an update. I *love* the idea of mixing my self-centredness with awful intentions on top of a villian -- cause I would probably be a pretty awful villian if I were out to try and manipulate people (another thing I'd change about helena and how she manipulates).

I had more ideas, but they're escaping me now.

### 2023-01-13 03:38 - so I'll just lay it out...

the [crazy idea on the midsommer's night dream](#2023-01-13-0216---crazy-idea-on-the-midsommers-night-dream) thing made it sound like I should somehow engage with sarah, and that seems all good, but here's the thing: I don't typically follow symbolic guidance. instead, I follow my emotions. so here's my basic checklist I go down:

1. if the situation were to happen, would I feel bad about it? if so, why/how and solve.

that's pretty much it. for some reason my giant list turned out to be not so long. so, I don't really feel bad about it at all. I don't know that I feel "good" about it either. I mean, it's an idea, and it appears to have "divine providence" to it, which means it has the blessing from lord saturn -- kinda. anyway, there's a lot to like about this. I really like how she's working so hard to vary her perceptions of how the same line can be seen. it's extremely interesting. the thing is, from my mostly 1st ray perspective, I see all emotion and body language as a function of desire. desire is *automatically* felt in conjunction with an emotion. all emotions contain an element of desire, so therefore all body language does as well. her way of looking at things is extremely interesting, kinda like she perceives acting and things as a function with variables -- like put in x ingredients and out comes the sequence. I don't see acting at all like this, though I don't know that I could deliver shakespere-like lines as easily as I deliver normal words. I mean it seems like it'd be a lot of fun to practise acting and stuff. it seems like it'd get me to perhaps think about the physical aspect of the conceptual world (something I never do because that's all astral, so I don't really pertceive it). I see concepts *without* their physicality, much like a girl does.

### 2023-01-13 19:49 - "seeing" concepts without their physicality

I feel like this is probably a good thing to note, because the capacity for a person to retain this capability through loss of virginity/innocence and is also likely to start out with quite an instinctual form of perception, cause they'll get the physical and still retain the conceptual. boys will probably start out with both (ohhh, that's why they're so keen on me; I get it, now... lol) interesting.

so that's really interesting because I will kind of set the instinct of perception (where to see barriers) for all of the "default" or "new souls" population, meaning they'll be real dreamers, meanwhile because I'm so open-minded, once they figure out how to sever the desire to eventually go toward wanted (only unwanted), they're actually in a bit of a conundrum. they're running an antiquated form of perception where the binary is between good and bad. my binary is not good and bad, but wanted/desired and unwanted/undesired. this creates a problem because if you want to be  a "bad-boy" now, you have to dedicate your life to experiencing unwanted. there are some real workers out there that really want to prove the misery of life, and they'll really work it out for a very long time -- or they could decide to *occasionally* (and, I really mean occasionaly, cause life is bleak) experience a little bit of wanted/desired. I don't mind at all they want to try and keep good and bad/evil going for a little while longer. for me it's kind of amusing, kinda like the players thought the female roles were amusing.

### 2023-01-13 23:01 - the king and bert are the same guy viewed from different perspectives.

I just noticed this, but I can't explain myself just yet.

also, I noticed a that parolles says a lot of really interesting stuff to helena, predicting the qualities of her husband, and explaining that virginity isn't everything is cracked up to be.

### 2023-01-13 23:06 - reflectance

I noticed that I'm a really good reflector, so who do I want to reflect to whom? so for example, if I take on your perspective, I'll improve upon it greatly and many things -- so for example, thmings that could potentially bother you will probably not bother me, so it's most likely that improved perception is what will get reflected (absorbed and retransmitted) back. something to think about.

### 2023-01-13 23:11 - wherever there is a sick joke, there is a message

I noticed the "double falsehood" of the shakesperean method. they put in on the first layer a really cringy and annoying woman, but at the same time making really disgusting image and toilet humour on top (to make these horrible things they're saying easy for the players to laugh at).

    falsehood is the thing that you look at.
    falsehood is the magician's wand.
    first falsehood is the ridiculous drama.
    second falsehood is the erotic imagery.
    beneath both falsehoods, is an even deeper message:

    Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles
    Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:
    Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain all,
    The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,
    And is enough for both.

1. war is costly, and a treaty/surrender/agreement would benefit both sides.
2. something about a gift large enough to stretch between the two.
3. the idea that it's OK for kenny to go off and help nosebook for a while. his gift can be shared.

so, what I've noticed (especially in the other monologues, like the one about two becoming one), is that when there's really erotic imagery, this is where the actually deeper meaning things are found.

---

really, the way that this whole play feels to me like is -- imagine for a moment that I were to head down there -- well, at some time I would have to leave. it would be icpossible to stay there forever, so this is a forever eventuality. the whole point of this play is for helena to not try and control but to learn to just let happen. that's my initial feeling and so far I'm only in act 2.

### 2023-01-13 23:25 - I'm reminded of starting the relationship

there was this thing that tim said in one of his videos almost saying as if he had some experience on it. it seems to me that his wife was the one that initiated the relationship and then wanted him to wear the pants. helena (venus) is pursuing bertram (mars), and notice how she's trying to organise and arrange everything just the way she likes it. it's easy thing to do, having committed that sin myself.

from helena's perspective, the problem is when I try and line everything up with the symbols that I want (3 emissive). like helena, when she does that everything falls apart. what I've learned is that the desire perspective is the best one. I know good things are coming to me, so all I have to be is kinda ready or semi-conscious enough to get them. my ablity to get them 150% *always* depends on how I feel. I get these things called zolts, which are massive ideas and concepts, and they're conceptually quieter than a whisper. I can't be all worked up over how I look or whatever if I'm receiving those things. I think on my top things that helea does which is annoying is worrying about stuff she has no control over. attempting to exert control or wish that the circumstance were different is the exact *wrong* (nothing good about this way) to use desire. you can't wish now to be any different than it is; you have to accept now unconditionally, and just allow myself to go toward wanted/desired. it seems like all my life I've been one more step closer to making my own network. anyway.

so, helena in this play is putting the moves on, and what tim would like to add here is that helena can't take over the gas pedal, and then stop pushing the gas. she has to be consistent in her desire, (and in this play) even if it isn't what she wanted at first. she can just try again for what she wants. when something goes away, this is when the desire for the next return.

there's also another strange thing about helena in this play, which is that she's seen like the father in the parable of the prodigal son. in this one, bertram is leaving her nest and going out into the world and becoming material and of the world (wars and conflict), so when bert comes back to helena, it's like the prodigal son returning to the father. have you ever wondered why the father is so happy to have such a failure of a son to come back home to him? put him right to work? "told ya so!" exploit him cause he's of higher social status than she?

---

hey, do you want to make like a website or some kind of program where someone can make notes and link ideas between sentences? I really wish there were a way to express my thoughts more multidimensionally. I have a lot of ideas. it'd be pretty cool to eventually get a bunch of programmers going on some of my ideas. cause, like you know I want to link a number of my ideas together there,

because loss is always only part
of the cycle, and so it only
matters how you perceive it.

loss is linked directly to desire.
more loss, more desire.
desire is like a void.
for creation to fill the void.

I'm so awesome; it doesn't matter
how much I lose, look at everything
that I continually create because

I'm a radiant star.

### 2023-01-14 00:15 - the king is lord chronos

the thing is, that bertram is kinda like the king, too but a young developing version.

### 2023-01-14 01:04 - problems with the symbols

I'm just going to be ultra straightforward, because why not.

as I'm reading the "all's well that ends well" play, I'm getting a completely different set of symbols from [the shakespearean revelation](/the-manifestation.md#2023-01-13-1743---the-skakesperean-revelation).

the thing is, in that one I had some combined symbols of hamlet and how you like it (and potentially a few others I'm not remembering -- usually the "problem" plays). I also really liked in one of your videos how you edited the play and showed the short vs the long theatrical versions. I'm going to read hamlet next (and it feels like maybe another -- winter's tale? -- oh, msnd) -- but if I take parts from each play and combine the similar characters (like young hamlet and bertram), I can kinda put the stories together.

here's why I say this: let's just assume for a moment that you're helena, and I'll be bertrand. the way it looks is that I get a zaryn-like figure (parolles) sweeps me off to "the war" which is inevitably all of the stuff they're designing to "rule the world" (dr. evil impression[^1]) and apparently lots of girls, too. OK, so then I get like totally annoyed by the fact that you're still chasing me around and I wanna hang out with the boys and play with their toys with them -- you know, like misguided love in helena's opening speech. the main problem is, that's not at all likely to be remotely close to what happens. they have a lot of ideas about how to do things, and so do I, so I'm just going to keep working toward going toward that -- right. in the play, the countess tells bertram that he needs not to be doing any work and he replies that he will not, not with all the legs (open) in front of him. I mean, I don't really want to "not work", and just have to service girls or whatever. in reality, what that I see is saying that he should go for the effortless way of doing things.

here's what I know that's way different from bertram. I know that I'll eventually get what I'm looking for, so there's no need to rush anything or try to make anything happen. so, when it comes to these things, I'll be hanging out with the girls, but not cause it's like some thing I have to do, but because evetually, you get bored and want to make something -- or, in my case, some aspect of technology annoys me and I want to improve it -- so I think about ways to improve things. that's likely what I'll be doing, not going to war or anything like that. I'd love to talk with other people about their products and brainstorm new sollutions. I've actually even been thinking of doing that this summer to make money (cause from my perspective, no thing has changed until I decide to go a different path; "wrong way", I guess).

also, the idea that I'm going to always be away from "home" is entirely a creation of your own mind. I had an interesting experience happen to me this morning (or was it yesterday), where someone came to the realisation that my ego is so large that I'm willing to always just let the opportunity slide by, because I know a bigger one is coming. what that means is, I'm basically learning how to "take what I can get". inotherwords, I'm so willing to just keep letting the desire evolve (until I become the thing), the person observing me had the realisation that I'm learning to be like, "OK, this is enough, 'you take what you can get, right?'". I'm always willing to be like, yeah, no problem, we'll do it next time. I wrote a famous quote down:

> there's no time like the present, to do something later.

I think that's how it went... anyway, the idea is that I can always put anything off, even the "good" stuff. this is probably the updated thing with bert-ram. the problem with that, is if I'm just chilling out, putting off the marriage duties, it's because I'm just like totally fine "doing something later, now." (reminds me of vsauce's dong, anyway). in that case, I'm simply refusing to consumate the marriage because I'm me and I want to really go to work (not war, because we're a few centuries into the future here) and I really want to work on stuff (prolly like coi and stuff). you know, so it's like not even all that big of a deal.

when I put this play and its symbols into modern times and the present state of events, I don't even come close to seeing all of the same things.

OK, I'll start working on a synopsis of the symbols in this (and other) plays. seems like a good idea.

[1]: I see myself as scott to these guys -- like their attempts to take over the world are so poorly misguided, they're totally missing the point that emotion is what everyone desires, not the things... they think their super heist is rasomming the world for ONE MILLION DOLLARS! I think it's funny. good job, dad!

#### 2023-01-14 01:53 - perpetually tommorow

the reason that I see forever that I don't need the manifestation right now, is that I don't really mind that it comes later because later is always bigger and more meaningful. the maximum possible "not needing the manifestation" I think is basically that I become the thing that I desired. we become one flesh. I am essentially you and you are essentially me, but I still stay this group of atoms is "me" and that group of atoms is "you". what makes my atoms different than your atoms, is that my atoms resonate like "me" and your atoms resonate like your "me".

perpetually tomorrow is only possible in eternity; gatta think like you're eternal. I've called it universal consciousness, source consciousness, 4th ray consciousness, etc. the great deception to everyone is that we're not eternal. you decide what form you are in. some only believe they can take on a physical body with the birth process, but it's possible to get any clump of atoms to become conscious and interact. btw, the other real elephant in the revolution -- is that, all around us, our entire world is becoming conscious. soon, our entire world and every aspect of our surroundings will have some form of consciousness or another.

### 2023-01-14 01:45 - parolles and lafew are the same guy

lafew is only "good" and offers good advice because of his "noble" status. I get the sense that if lafew were in a more selfish position, he would also be a bit more like parolles.

#### 2023-01-15 14:13 - are they castor and pollok?

I say this because it seems like I remember something tauren or bull-like, then bert'ram. this is the constellations gemini -> taurus -> aries (the war god)

### 2023-01-14 02:32 - why do I speak so plainly about things?

the reaction is that by speaking so plainly about things, it's a bit aguafiestas.

I find romance extremely awkward. social syntax has always been an impossibility to me, as nobody is actually clear with their syntax. advance! no, too far. where are you guing? don't leave. woah, too close. -- I mean I peace out from that stuff all my life. I don't want to play games. I'm a computer program, so romance is bad programming. syntax error. program cannot compile.

there just simply not enough communication in most relationships, that to add romance, adds another layer of distance as well. you also have to understand too that I'm already preparing mentally to no longer have this masculine body soon. I'm like super pumped to go tearing through reality at record pace. when I'm you, there's no surprise or romance. you just want it and then it happens. reality creates instantly and is a reflection of perception. most people want drama and excitement though, so for them occulted, secret, and unclear syntax and communications is the same of their game, because they can manipulate the signal. I am what I say I am.

if you also look at my symbols, you'll notice that I always prefer to make everything as "normal" and NLS -- with all manifestations being pretty normal, and unextraordinary. it's for this original reason that I dislike celebrations. one thing I noticed a lot with saturnian folk is that they really like their celebrations. drunken revelry is their thing. I'm not really into that for the same reason. a celebration is, by definition, *not* NLS. as such, I'm kinda against marriages even. it's good to have a symbol of possession (like a ring or whatever), but since it's always whatever you want it to be (like parolles virgin speech), so it's not so much the chaste, but the ones that actually like theirselves. the big moment for the virgin is the sort of "celebration" instinct that aligns with saturn and the 4th ray.

the 4th ray perspective is correct, which is "take what you can get" aka, "be present in the now" aka "enjoy the journey", etc. -- and the basic idea is that outside of time (the saturnian perspective), you don't really grow or advance any. you're sort of stagnated, sedintary -- and it's real boring there. therefore, to not get overtaken by the tidalwave of boredom, that is eternity, they believe in siezing the moment and really taking pleasure in the aeromaatic and sensual things of life. that's all really good and valid perspective, but I perfer to drive fast, so that means what matters to me is how I feel, and I like incremental changes in how I feel (NLS) rathar than big and sudden (destabilising) changes. there is no greater prolonged excitement than to experience one's own creation in a constant state of birthing (or can be seen like chain-birthing -- like one causes another -- and the constancy of explosions becomes the "norm" -- steady and constant novelty).

I know that sounds terrifying and painful from a female perspective, but to my perspective (and this is probably an improvement), watching something continue to remain in the birthing process means that it never gets too big too quickly. I have control issues, I guess.

I noticed that only the 1st ray and perhaps the 5th 6th, and 7th perspective like surprises. the 1st ray perspective is that I want to be surprised. the universe shows me more and more awesome things all the time -- way better than I could dream up -- so why not just let it surprise me. the 5th ray loves inspiration -- new thoughts and ideas (and their corresponding feeling of intoxication) popping in, is amazing. in the 6th ray, new things popping in create desire/fear (1st ray), and 7th ray also creates desire/fear directly. interesting relations to the 1st ray there.

by definition, all of the concepts presented in shakespere, are *at best* conversation starters, because they're so outdated. I love seeing the symbols, cause I take everythting personally ("what you talkin to me?" situation-style), so I pretend all the symbols reflect me, and the story is just sorta like unbelievable and over the top to me. I know that it'll be something far more mundane, yet extraordinary (supra-mundane?), where even the most bland stuff is pretty awesome. I also know that all things evolve and change, so I like to sorta ride the wave of evolution of a concept (or desire).

every time that someone reacts to a concept, the concept changes ever so slightly until it comes to general stability -- then, something like a massive change in social perception can radically destabilise a concept. for example, a word like "niggardly" feels to me like it has a high rate of conceptual impact all the time (not a clear definition and association with the word) and so feels like is shifting around in minds much more (people aren't dictionaries, you know), and so doesn't at all feel like a stable word to me -- like "stable" does, for example.

what that means that all of this stuff that I talk about is *automatically* guaranteed *not* to happen... "outdated" is the mantra I repeat in my inner monologue. it's so cool to outdate a concept, and the *main reason* why I write about a lot of stuff; I know that when I write it, it won't happen.

isn't it funny to think about whatever happens, probably won't be written down. looking back from the future, it could be anything. almost certainly it'll have a couple revisions anyway.
