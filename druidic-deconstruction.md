### 2023-02-21 15:06 - strong female characters

let's say I have a history of women turning rotten after my influence with them. let's also say that once they get past my surface image, and start to get to know me, it's irreparable damage after that. therefore, if I want to try and bring that out in them, one way to do it, is to make endless scripts about girls that go through irreparable damage (like shakespere). --incomplete--

another angle to accomplish my goal to make women stronger (or at least ones that I want to be around -- and after all, the characters we put in our stories are reflections of our base emotions like desire and fear) -- therefore I *need* to find a way to write scripts that feature female characters that, seemingly transcend certain clear negative influences on them and around them.

thoughts? feelings? do you think it's possible? my personal opinion on it is that it *is* possible, but it's not something I actually want. here's why: in the game of images, whomever broadcasts the strongest is the dominant image that's perceived, therefore, I always want to be the strongest projector of my image, so that it's not perceived the *reality* of the charactor. if these strong female characters that I wanted to make were able to project stronger than me, they *would* be strong and would overcome negative influences, but they would also see through me.

another way to look at it, is that we're all trying to prove the world that we live in as right, honourable, and justified. if they were to project a different reality that the one I see, then what I see is no longer right, honourable, or justified. all things that happen in my constructed reality which are not "cut from my whole cloth" are all not right, not honourable, and definitely not likely/justified.
