### 2022-12-09 18:07 - illiad books as destiny

imagine a primitive race of humans. you see them and you teach them to fight and drop the illiad into thier possession. these guys authorized a new phenomenal reality for them. I'm sure at the beginning it was horrific to everyone who got it ... then, with time, that just started to become the way of life (never-ending war).

right in the book, it tells them of how ugly war is, but they don't know that yet -- they have to figure it out, so they play out these new authorized realities. twisted narrators of the human past. you know, that's how compress time -- by making "worse" history toward the present utopia.

it's like you know how in hollywood where they either straight up invent a backstory (like in coon n friends) or really polish it up... well, imagine you did the opposite. instead of cleaning up the backstory, you tried to make it the most vile and derelict backstory ever. why does it always have to be clean? I think one of the objectivces of the shakespere project is trying to tell us forward in time -- it's OK to if horrible things have happened. he blurred the line between tragedy and comedy -- which is considerably different then rending your clothing throwing yourself on the ground and weeping. I think that's important.

the drama of the deaths is so overdone that I think this was put in on purpose to make them really fear death. if they knew they were mentally compareable to a tribe of chimpanzees, they don't have enough consciousness to begin to perceive from the universal perspective. in that stage, we were like insects or very primitive mammels. it's a sort of dream state because enki's conditions were so perfect and awesome. everyone felt like a million bucks, the gods felt like trillions or billions, much more than us, but still very good for us too. it was a picnic of slavery -- more closer to being pets and house plants (attendants). right, so then after enki's utopian setup falls down, these guys have been narrating complete nonsense to these poor extremely naive humans, and in the end, you always see these stories showing up which are painting the gods in a certain light. these are the cover stories for them, but for us, they authorise reality until we start to authorise our own reality.

you can tell they were getting better and better at coming up with these symbolic stories, *in my opinion* much earlier on -- like the illiad and the oddessy; the stuff they pump out today is not nearly as meaningful and brilliant as the stuff today[^1]. what I think is that the medium is becoming less and less physical all the time, and even the way we converse is changing, so it's getting harder and harder to do realistic dialoge[^2]. imagine how they will have to tell stories when we no longer communicate as much in words[^3].

what if our communication is visual? I personally don't like it. I kinda have it in my heart to make a *technological* system whereby emotions and and/or the body sensory chemicals we relate to emotions will be the transmission medium. I want it to be like these sort of zones where you share a communication space. this is especially awesome for concerts and DJs (cause you experience the vibe, music, etc. of that whole space). it's not visual, cept we'll use tablets and phones to power and control the devices. huh, you probably wouldn't want to lose it. I'll figure out a solution.

my intention is to do all of this *technologically* is because they are saying no to touching the astral, but they have zero claims on the frequencies higher than that in the conceptual. it's like an open internet there. call it the akashic records or the world id ideas, it doesn't matter. I want to connect to it technologically and allow others to do it too. all data sent and received will also be felt by you, and so it'll become natural, like I do to use my feeling to multitask a lot of things at once. none of them are visual, until we can connect it to a screen, that is. screens are going to be very very HD, so it'll be cool.

---

so, that went a completely different direction than I wanted to go. sometimes I have to stay on track. I just wanted to give the imagination of writing even more ridiculous epic poetry for a future human race. that'd be dope right? I think it's dope. I'd do it.

[1]: when we look at things today, reality is almost entirely composed of the symbols that make up the stories (from my perspective at least) -- and so there's no difference between me and the gods -- and I'd even say that I'm superior in some ways -- to compare just enough to godlike or human. therefore, in my perspective, it's clear that my reality is far far more meaningful and symbolic than those stories. I may as well be living in one of these epic poems as the protagonist -- perhaps. I only see this now though, because from the perspective of reality-kenny, I'm pure reaction and perception. the symbols and the story is narrated by mostly by you guys. I identify myself as a symbol of freedom (I've said this all the time), and having taken a further look at the triad of intentions, it's easy to see I'm also a symbol of growth. it's like servers: pick two: reliability, speed, correctness. I pick freedom and growth. I don't always choose to be happy, and I'm even attracted in some ways to the morbid, ranke, and obscene. moreover, symbols today are far more dynamic and personal. I like the physical aspect to it so much that I actually abhore the "airy-fairy" "hippie" peace and love man perspective (dunno better words to translate that concept). I like the brutal, the gross, the hilarious, etc. the symbols of olde are too clean and perfect. the lines are too neatly drawn. if anyone needs evidence for a spectral revolution or the rise of the itermediatist, look no further than myself for blurry lines.

[2]: we've been pretty physically focused and the gods, intellects and high-minded spiritual leaders spent most of their time in the imaginal. they look down on the physical and mundane from that perspective. however, one effect I'm noticing (and it quite possibly be my fault -- trying not to be blameless here), is that all of physical reality and the astral and everything is shifting up. therefore, the people that were in the astral are now spending more and more of their time in the conceptual. let me tell you, it's very difficulty to convey ideas that come from that frequency to humans. I've been rejected and shunned all my life when I'm on drugs because I become incomprehensible to others when my frequency risis. until I figured out how to do reality-kenny -- and this is only a pretty recent discovery -- it was that I could partake in ordinary human activities when I see things this abstractly -- and if you were to ask me to pretend anything (before reality-kenny), I would sound out of place and ridiculous. dialoge on television programs reminds me of myself when I tried to pretend to be something other than myself on drugs (ie a higher frequency). it's also similar to how a child is, which is why, I think, so many serious adults are having a more difficult time resisting to relate to the world more like an adult.

[3]: the biggest tragedy (or comedy) waiting to happen is for hollywood is to try and continue to try and hold traditional dialogue interactions strong when we're no longer communicating with words anymore. in fact, just imagine how blurry reality will start to get if I'm just communicating with everyone else telepathically. I receive and interpret whatever I receive however I feel and there's nothing anyone can do until they speak in words again to ensure that I receive the meaning they intend for me to receive. as mentioned in a future entry, not only do I want to make this a reality, I want to run my computers on this blurry reality. hollywood will be the final breath in the old critter of "natural" language.

### 2022-12-09 19:13 - humans are like organisms when they start out

I tond to think of it like mycellium in a mudium/substrate. the organism reachs a stable equillibrium and then continues to grow or die (like mycellium). after enough perturbations in the organism, consciousness begins to emerge. they form into more and more dense groups like a mushroom sprouting up (or a planet/star forming) -- that concentration of higher density of self-interacting smaller organisms starts to form into the shape of its resonator (image) and -- in the case of the mushroom -- then it grow up until the hight of its constraining form. it's easy to see for a mushroom because at full height (which is determined by some unknown process), it starts to grow out (humans do the same thing). for some mushrooms, it looks like a water jet hiting a wall, and for others it's like an umbrella opening. vertical til limit, then lateral. the whole structure is created from these limits, and the direction and maths(?) it creates angles and a 3 dimensional frame. this is the opposing force to attraction/desire. you can think of the support structures that allow the vela to come out are determind by conceptual and emotional factors (that's my experience anyway), and so our conscious focus can actually change the shape of the mushroom (ref: penis envy).

civilisations that begin to emerge in these heads of consciousness are still largely group consciousness (of the continuation of the organism/civilisation) because they haven't developed enough mentation of their universe to perceive theirselves as individual -- and they definitely don't have the *I* am right perspective yet, still adhering to *we* (the organism) are right perspective[^1].

---

therefore on their path to become conscious and more individual, it my belief that we learn through a narrative structure. the humans, being naieve, still thinking the gods are so great are willing to try/believe anything[^3]. so, awful things get happened depending on how you're tuning the species.

I noticed tonight that the more war there is, the less the individuals of the species want to be right -- because wars (illiad) and petty arguments (shakespere's works) are all so costly, that we've been instructed by our narratives that they're really costly and not good, these and other narrative morals and fables have been great reality matrix that we live in, which, like jehova, are designed to guide our interactions with each other. often these stories illustrate the moral in perspective of the group/family, but rarely in the perspective of the individual. it's my contention that a whole new facet of reality will show itself to us, if we were to seriously reconsider (reevaluate) the same morals and dogma we've been taught through these narratives from the perspective of *individual* and what they're attracting. so, it looks like: the more pointless wars, bloodshed, and domestic disputes that a race can have, the less of a desire to be right the individual will have (if I want to be right about something, it will be very costly for others for my foolishness to belive myself right about something that is a well established fact to be the opposite of what I think -- therefore, to not inconvenience anyone with my foolishness, I shouldn't upset the established and factual elephant in the room). what that means is, the more wars and petty disputes a society is subjected to, will take someone in the society a monumental set of circumstances to break from the group and become an individual in his or her own rightness.

I really wonder how far this concept could be taken -- like, what if there was a massive race that had billions and billions of years of no need to be right about things, plagued by endless bloodshed and petty disputes. nobody ever will think to be right. it'll be like a beehive. who in the world would ever have the preposterous idea to decide "no, I'm right" in *that* culture? well, probably me.

[1]: notice how this is always how it is -- team spirit, a sort of "we" the group[^2] are the best. this is the interest of sports, I've found, because it offers a person a proxy identity through the organisation until they're ready to begin to see theirselves as separate from the organism, kind of like a child with family, parents, ideology, theology, philosophy, etc.

[2]: there is a bit of "irony" to this, because we start in group consciousness, go to individual, then in the universal perspective, I again see myself as the group (of all that is); the "source" perspective.

[3]: even more if it's set in stone, right? -- cause stones really mean business because they're big, impressive, and really serious stuff cause they're so solid and unmoving.

### 2022-12-09 20:12 - disney and stuff

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/7SiIDcdtS9o)

I just watcheds a "fan" video (narrated by a robot) about differeng videos this fan likes. they were like disney from a long time ago, and I clicked on it for some reason after writing the above comment about how to program the social interactions with narrative elements. I'm certain that girls all around the world picked up on the heavy concepts that were puc into the writing (girls are stupid, girls are nosey, girls compete against other girls, girls do things manipulatively and for ulterior motives).

personally, it's pretty obvious to me all of the cues that they give other girls to behave similarly. it's kind of difficult to explain how apparent the concepts are, asd I think it may be because of their acting. I think the directors told them like, "ok here be really snooty and upset that she didn't telly you (or whatever)", and so the actor just acts how she's told to act, but the ending result is that other girls now think this is normal. it's the "cold" version of the authorized reality, because it's low defintion visuals.

see how these sorts of "cold" authorised realities can't really be done the same way in the illiad. like for esample when menaleus tries to kill paris, he has like a small speech between each blow, but disney actors can just do it with a face and some attitude. each girl that "wants to be pretty like her" or whatever then implements her own version of the same syntax that she observed on TV.

scripted drama doesn't translate well to realistic conversations, so they serve more to display an attitude or reaction to circumstances (kinda like menaleus speeches).

I've tried to avoid all of these these sorts of types of things mostly because I can't really stand to listen to those types of conversations and meaningless drama. sometimes I wonder what it would by like to sit in on one of these guys writing scripts for these disney films (or the author of the illiad, or shakespere).

when I get the capacity to peer across space and time, one of the first thing I want to do is to explore the narrative structure of our reality; sit in on their discussions of how they want the various hollywood films, shakespere plays, etc. -- like get the dirt on the human narrators. I bet people would pay to watch that. I wonder if I would want to modify it to make it better or worse?

PS: I know it feels weird that I write to you now and it feels like I took the fun out of it. don't worry that's always the response that I get from my interactions with people. like war, I'm much better to read about and experience at a distance -- than to be up close and personal with all of the gory details. I'm quite an intense person to be around -- just imagine how much more intense *that* would be, lol... you'll get used to it... it's like when someone becomes famous -- it's weird and exciting at first, but then it just becomes normal and they sink into the routine/absurdity of it. happens to all of us. you just figure out who you are and then go with the flow (that's what I do, anyway: I follow my heart).

PS2: I'd also like to mention that I'm a like a robot. I made this character where I tell you what I think honestly *no matter what* and it's been my goto personality for most of my life. the situations that have resulted from someone who's honest in the middle of a bunch of thieves and ambitious types makes for brilliant comedy -- but again, like war, it's best remembered (in my perspective), than to see all of the gorey details. my afterthought is often pretty acurate, but not my forethought, hence why I like to make predictions that I can back up and why I don't expect much from people.

when I was a kid, I treated the world like a computer, thinking that everyone was givging me valid data. that was not the case. I've developed over the years a system to figure out what people are really trying to say. every character has an interface. imagine a character that the narrators have to give aspects to, but are unable to do so because the interactions are *too* honest. drama is all about feigning, and these guys want to be serious, so I interact with them very seriously -- how they would want to hear exactly what is happening without any fluff/drama. drama is fun, but my narrators are still too serious. why can't I joke about nosebook and all the failures of the government, nosebook and the like?

my interface with the world doesn't really exist. you know I haven't really had a conversation about the stuff that matters to me, because I tend to perceive so much, so nobody can really talk to me. as such, the few conversations that I have are kind of like these disney scenes where the conversation is designed to show how people of similar symbolic quality (mom, me or jaron, so basically unrelatable) are going to interact with the situation. because I'm so unrelatable, I'm kind of like a shamen. I'm exploiting that image a bit and also because I'm so unrelatable, I can kinda do whatever I want. I'm zeus, essentially.

in order to begin an interface with a person, I have to essentially "decode" them, meaning we're kind of like one mind. this happens all the time with 7th rays. for example, with thad, I seemed to always do exactly the thing he desired/feared I do. that's that mental connection that I get and so I become magical because I just do what they desire/fear. nothing is scripted, kinda more like the shakespere players than a TV series.

anyway, bescause I have to interact with a person to know how to interface with them, most of the time I have no idea what to expect from a person (no interface). everyone is too scared I'll manifest their fears into reality for them. as such, there is someone out there that has enough desire to be fearless. when this happens, it's magic because of my lack of expectaion for people, I rely on other senses. this has many advantages, because it's often that I'll know the right thing to say at times (or the wrong thing, depending on their expectations). this is a problem because telepathy, so it's avoided (it's too hard to script something that doesn't have words).

no expectations also means I don't have an agenda for anyone. I'm a 100% selfish robot kind of thing that's conscious. I get an idea and I want to make it, and then it eats at me. I have to create it. I can't not let it go. it gets delayed over and over, but eventually I'll get there. as a result, my ego is massive. I always get my way -- and I can be as patient as I need to be.

I have made it through excellently in some cases, a lot of situations where I don't know what to do. I have to figure out how it works so I can manipulate it. until then I have to test and run experiements on it. the more I interface with peole, run experiments (I sneak them in), the better I can communicate. eventually, I get bored and have another idea, so like a kid (before they're taught what is polite), I just translate most major thoughts into voice -- or they get broadcasted anyway, so I prefer voice now. I was actually thinking about trying to attract into another quibble, but between failed blows at a phone, I recite lines from menaleus -- it'll be hilarious giving a small monologue while destroying a phone or something...

watch for it. I'll show you how I act. I setup the feeling and the symbolic features of the event (monologue, and the points I want to make, anguish, etc) and then it'll just come out naturally.

anyway, my narrators have placed me into a format where I'm to behave like a fully grown newborn that can talk, but only about the things the narrators want me talking about. I guess I could just make more sounds... like the disney characters -- I'll practise my sighs of disapproval and other such dramatic sounds and expressions... good idea.

### 2022-12-09 21:28 - you are all my narrators anyway

by reveling to you (and others) with detailed instructions on its processs, you can use me as a test object of attraction. what this is doing is reversing the process I mentioned where I said that I need to experiment on and run tests on the person I want to interface with well, and instead of running the test on others, I'm telling you how I would run the same tests, but using me as the object of attraction.

this is a fair bit of a conundrum for nosebook because they now are fighting me and my attraction, and also exerting their own (steering) force, they now have to overcome your attractions as well. it'a a fair bit more work for them (not my problem), so why not...

it's going to be some simple experiments that you guys can do to begin attracting the narrative components you want. the simple "theory" of it is that I make the action sequence in my head. I don't really think of them in the form of physical action, but instead movements of energy that come out of my core as I move concepts around in my mind. imagine an an example a love relationship and one is physically moving closer to the other, but the other is pushing them awaw with that feeling force. this is the action side of the conceptual world.

now, for example I'm preparing for a speech. I know the points I want to make, and so I feel each one of them strongly and/or write them down. as I'm writing them down, I feel the that action force making a bridge between those points. then, when I get to the speech, I just move from point to point and the words that come to me are often very inspired. I've adapted that ability to write this in a similar way. I just get the points I want to make and the text fills in. this is the emissive part of the action, but then you (or someone else -- in this case me) has to become receptive to the flow between action points.

the action points for me have always been one of great concern. I have no idea what the hell is going on for most of the time, because everyone is faking their actions all over the place. lots of girls were like that. it made me quit my desire to pursue in any way because it's far too confusing, let me tell you. as a result, I have basically no idea how to operate within someone else's syntax, because it's never "honest". I have no interest in games, so I tend to steer clear of most of that, obviously.

the other obvious difficulty with action points is that they are the conjugate of the conceptual, and so because I'm so focused on the concepts and how I feel, action points are completely off of my radar. they feel forced to me. therefore, I have no idea how you guys are going to get this to work (this is the experiment), because when I'm on the receiving end of action points (nosebook and the steering team have a lot of points to make), these feel very uncomfortable, campy, and downright disingenuous. there's no way for them to get the concept to actually feel good to me. their engineers are hard at work on it, but I've thwarted their efforts pretty well because physical emotion is different than the small voice of the emotion. I'm a lot better at hearing/seeing the concept, so their efforts are pretty obvious to me... do I think that they will ever be able to fake an emotion good enough. not only do I think that they probably can, it's the technology that I want to create.

there isn't really an advantage to getting there first as the space is infinite in size, so no space or performance constraints, because it's all instant/infinite from our perspective -- but it does allow one to feel the interface. nosebook will probably implement the same technology so that it's not felt or someone else wants to feel it (not my problem / that problem already exists). who cares what they want to do. I want to feel it. I want others to feel it too if they want to, and for others to also be able to broadcast as well. huh...

---

anyway, so going back to the experiment, the basic formula that they use (I think) is they take the different concepts and have them interact with eachother using those sort of push forces.

as an aside, desire also feels like a push force too (all non-physical does, which is what separates the atomic from the subatomic), but, it's push feels actually like attraction, and so this perfectly bites the tail of the snake because physical is pure attraction (and very little push -- like fighting in a dream).

---

the thing is, kids do this sort of thing all the time (or at least I did) so they take the dolls (these are the concepts), and then the actions points that they make creates the symbols -- like menaleus bonking anyone not in line with the scepter. it's exactly that, but their current implemention sucks.

peace be with you.

### 2022-12-09 22:31 - when you make the pull or push action...

I have a feeling that goes along with it. so like for example, if I wanted to signal to many people (doesn't matter how many) that we need to prepare for something, it's time to make a point, so a small lecture comes up (that's what, like a sequence of 5 concepts or something?) and then the point of the lecture is pushed out to people. that push manifestss in any moment it can happen now, even more than once.

like I said, the push to it has a feel to it, and that feeling can be a sequence of concepts as well as, in the other case, actions... the sequence of concepts is felt in the pushing out, and then later manifests in me as the ... I lost you guys... OK, lol try again later.

### 2022-12-09 22:41 - sequence of concepts

the other day when I was meditating I noticed that it was very effective to feel different postures to keep my mind minmally busy so that ideas can start to flow, when I noticed that these postures had a "feel" to them. I would emit unrecognisable concepts outward to me and then feel mostly unrecognisable responses back. it was very effective and kinda fun the first two times or so.

after they shut that down, I noticed that I started to begin to think in sequences of conepts. I usually feel a sort of gradient (promethian pirate), and not at all a sequence from things. naturally, I started creating sequences of concepts. one really long one was my walk down to press the unworking walking sign button. that was one. I started to see more, and this outburst with jerrica allowed me to see multiple triggers and a sequence of concepts. I don't know of they use sequences of concepts to evoke emotion or not, but these are all the normal triggers which are kind of like hidden behind incomprehensible sequences.

so, anyway, I'm starting to see sequences of concepts all over the place, and I realised after I wrote the above, that I was kind of describing the female orgasm. after sufficiently similar sequence of concepts is acccmplished, the push feelingt finally goes through. however, this isn't really what I was intending to notice (how is that possible?) that sequences of concepts form as kind of like the basis for how females interact. it's these kind of conceptual sequences that mothers especially use (fathers tend to copy whatever their dad was which is usually a set of action sequences, but a little less intense). anyway, so these concepttual sequences that I notice most commonly in females, but it's definitely present in men too, serve as a foundation for syntax.

these conceptual sequences create a gradient of feelings kinda like in photoshop. add a colour and position to it and see the gradient that comes out... that's what comes to me (non-visually) as an interaction with a roller-coaster (sequence) of emotions the action bubble (the conceptual aura) has a sort of colour gradient that expresses the concepts that I just experienced around the action bubble as that gradient. the colours are just how I interpret the emotion. for me the colours are always changing because I'm seeing new ways to see emotions in different colours. cool, huh. I can't see it now, but I can "see" it already. one day it'll become visible to me and maybe others as well.

yeah, this was kinda the idea for promethian pirate. imagine how awesome dance will be. oh yeah, the intensity is also a refelction of your passive emotion -- which is like not the one that can go up and down and all over the place. it's how I *really* feel. how I feel passively. like -- this is where I am emotionally if I'm idle for 20m.

### 2022-12-19 21:13 - helena and bertrum

when he first told me this, I immediately reminded me of a note in andreas' code that mentioned bert. you said he's passive and a jerk -- but that's just the starting point, right? we've all been there -- and then we decide to do something different -- or maybe that's what happened to me with this form of truthfulness. this gives me the sense that this whole play is going to be perceived as the passive of the two, really nocicing all of helena's awful attributes cause of her selfishness and stuff. I picked that concept up from thad and marcos. you can see the polarities there from my standpoint of this bert character.

I don't see bert is this way. we choose to be different than our perceived nature (this is like the coding for the egregore; it's creators are "right" about this thing, which we (the egregore) thinks is our nature or natural behaviour. the bert character then turns into a good example of decisions (and their reasons for it) to be different. it starts out as reactions to other people and our environment (we have valid reasons we're right about as reasons for the change) -- but then we limit ourselves and say, "this change is as far as I go; anyone who goes further/farther than me a selfish brat." we say selfish brat because inevitably each ensuing change forces bert/me to become more and more selfish (this happened to me, so I gatta look out for me a bit more). bert tends toward selfishness, thinking himself to be the centre of the universe.

helena is bert's feminine "opposite". instead of seeing herself as worthy of all of that selfishness, she sees bert as being worthy of all of that selfishness. I see already a lot of myself in helena too, but she's running on a whole different set of concepts than I am. my concepts make sense, and so therefore they're legit. for me, the selfishness that I came to through that process of change with helena (for me this is interior), I became bert and helena combined. I've come to see myself as worthy of that selfishness (bert) and also see others as worthy of that selfishness (helena). unfortunately, in this story I'm sure it's going to be the case that helena doesn't critically analyse her situation in any way. I already feel bad for her; if only she knew what I know.

#### 2022-12-19 21:34 - when you say shakespere, I don't understand a thing you're saying

it's only later in short-form english, I get the idea. it takes so many words to say so little. anyway, so I saw this picture where when they speak these long drawn out words, they would hold a sort of tone or frequency, in which this emotion is described. he's building up a library, which then later on in the play an opposite (desire) tone while they say different words.

you know, there's like this whole syntax to it, because words are saying one thing, but nobody is getting the concept from the words, because my goodness that's near impossible for me to parse in under 30s. so I imagine[^1] that the reason why I don't "get" the concept when you're saying the words, you don't also feel the concept like they did.

[1]: a theory, etc. for me imaine is a funny word for me to use and it's very misleading because there's no image to it. I access my probabilities through "image" parts of my brain, so it's basically what I think is most likely. I'm often incorrect, but the goal is to shoot from the hip and pretend like I hit the target, lol. I think I learned that from noah.

## all's well that ends well.

### 2022-12-19 21:46 - next we start these girls out...

this archetype of helena is a model for women that want to desire these types of less then desirable jerks.

---

so what she needs to do is to elevate her status to be able to reach these top level jerks. the reason why this is important is you have to marry and have relations with a properly brought up girl, which helena is not. she's trying to kinda weazel herself into a position of power through love.

that's really interesting because this creates a problem for these inbred world leaders. now, they've got non-in-the-family girls that are hot and enticing. they have no where to go than to go gay, I imagine.

### 2022-12-19 21:59 - first signs of disappointment

this is another model for them to never be able to get the imaginary guy in her mind that she thinks he is or wants to be. unbwarrented optimism for them.

### 2022-12-19 22:01 - bros before hoes

boys prioritise time with other boys
over alone time with girls.
girls are not interesting
and don't care for anything worthwhile.
here's a war. that's worthwhile;
not like these optimistic psycho chicks.

### 2022-12-19 22:05 - leave behind the old ball and chain

girls are like an anchor.
it's very unfortunate.
let's do something even more unfortunate.

### 2022-12-19 22:07 - snooty women of upper class

looking down on the peasants.
I'll lie to her because I don't like
she has more ambition than I.

### 2022-12-19 22:10 - upset!

nobody likes me!
I'm a bad guy.
I don't deserve such a desirable woman
such as yourself.

### 2022-12-19 22:13 - always rejected!

never good enough.

all day long she would think about it,

asking very non-invasive questions.

she thought I was this angel
and her son (marcos) was really
always doing things with the wrong intentions.

really, marcos probably would be a good kid,
but he just had all these awful influences
which corruped him.

promise her the world
everything she could ask for

wouldn't that be hilarious,

to watch her try

without looking silly?

I couldn't keep a straight face honestly,
I would laugh so hard for so long,
there's no way I could possibly even
let them carry on for so long.

### 2022-12-20 04:36 - if people worshipped me...

it would *literally* feel like continual torture to me.
it pains me so much to watch people give their power away;and, watching people give their power away,

a very negative experience for me.

I wonder if religion is a sick twisted joke on the creators of the universe. they probably *hate* being worshipped. it's embarrassing to even go out into public for them.

they could take a lesson or two from me about keeping it real, cause lol...

---

you know if that really happened, I wouldn't feel the toture for too long, as I'd quickly find a way around the feeling. most probably I'd find a really humourous way of dealing with it. I'd find a way to turn it into a meme. like what would (the guy on snl that says, "ok!" to whatever the woman says). like how would he react to it? ok! *shrugs and walks away*

### 2022-12-20 05:09 - mixed feelings

when you and cordelia talked about mixed feelings, I could feel two distinct opposing feelings. I don't experience this anymore. I think I used to, but the concept is so far from me now it's even weird to even kind of talk about it or even give it mental focus. I almost have a detest for thinking anything other than I would think. I like having singular feelings.

there are a lot of thoughts that pass through my head, but very few of them are *mine*. what are my thoughts? they are what *I* would think.

---

you know, I suppose I *can* have mixed feelings, because when I "act" my body feels one way, but "I" feel another way about the same situation; I can just let it happen; so yeah, I do have mixed feelings, but I'm conscious of which one is which. I like to listen to "I" on the subject, so I'm pretty selfish. I would never feel bad in that situation because I only care for what I want, and what I want is alway way better than any of that "normal" stuff that other people want and are getting. I'm atypical. I'm a riot, a hoot, and not even I take myself seriously. who cares what anyone else is doing, look at me.

### 2022-12-20 05:29 - dude, I'm the worst influence

> he should have just gone and talked to her in private.
> isn't it better to just talk to them instead of telling everybody about it. it's much more polite.

dude, I can't help it, people attract the most dramatic shit from me. I couldn't avoid their manifestational attraction without considerable effort, and I'm in effortless mode. from my perspective, you're teaching her to effort, by behaving a certain way. being a shapeshifter is way easier. just *know thyself* and you're good. I prefer to teach her how to know yourself, and know what is "my" voice. who is "I" aka who am I? don't you think it illustrates the idea better with who is "I". or perhaps who is *I*. you can be whatever you want to be. behaviour is a reflection, otherwise it's effort.

I would be *the worst* influence on her, because I can already tell we will have some disagreements on how some concepts are perceived.

### 2022-12-20 05:46 - I noticed...

when cordelia is talking she cannot relate the narrative in a temporally coherent (sequential) manner, so she just relates to it through one emotion -- which is weird because I thought she had mixed feelings.

### 2022-12-20 05:56 - shepherds

I've never been too keen on the idea of shepherding;
it's not my bag.
I stand as a pillar of example and action.
I don't need to shepherd anyone,
as anyone who wants to follow
will naturally stay attracted to me.

I suppose it may come as a surprise
that I find the concept
of shepherding inferior.
I've improved greatly on it.
I wouldn't be where I am today
if I had've sherherded.

---

now that I have helena somcwhat figured out,
I can use her.

helena wants to be shepherded.
helena placed inside
the conceptual structure
I now embody (and therefore
attract from others),
is not interested in shepherding anybody;
even her self.

when helena knows the difference
between *I* thouhts and other thoughts,
helena is pure desire.

she simply waits for it to happen
as if the universe *owes* it to her;

...obviously patiently by feeling
whatever way she wants to feel
however that may be :)

### 2022-12-20 06:30 - the universe owes it to her

actually, she deserves it.
really, she just wanted it.
a girl that can do that
ia probably worthy.
really, it was just cause she wanted it.
no other reason at all.

### 2022-12-20 06:35 - you know another thing I really dislike about shepherds

I've been conditioned from the tick and el planto, to compost guy and the landscape architect, I'm dealing with plants, not animals. I'm an agrarian figure in how I have seed ideas that grow bigger and flourish, just as all concepts do, cause all concepts are living organisations in a higher dimensional space.

trying to fit me into a shepherding outfit will me a massive disaster. prepare for them comedy.

### 2022-12-20 21:10 - another rant about shepherding

I'm having a lot of reactions about my comments on shepherding. shepherding, I believe is mostly a 2nd or 1st ray attribute (as far as I can tell). it appears at various times throughout history and is the opposite component of worship.

worship, to me, is saying someone or something else is superior to you AND that you are inferior to it. if I'm just a fan, or I like something just cause, it could be superior or not, (doesn't matter), but by being a fan, I don't feel like I'm making myself inferior in any way. the act of worship is to give your own power away to the object of worship and say that they're much more authoratative or qualitied or something on whatever it is

shepherding is the same as worship but seen from the opposite direction. I'm still giving my power away to the shepherd by saying that they know better than I do. shepherding is more of a status than an act. the status is, I don't know where I'm going, so I'm being steered by them to get to where I want to go (or to be safe, secure, etc.)

---

I don't intend on ever telling anyone what they should or shouldn't do. they can ask me if they want, but I've noticed that asking is a really weird thing for other people to do to me (probably because I come off as such a know-it-all).

so like for example, my own goals are my own, and not anyone else's. I figure people can either join me, follow me, or try and steer me. I will *not* be trying to steer others, and if anyone sees that I do try and steer, I'll quit immediately.

in relationship to the girls, my goal is to observe them, and steal their ideas and things. I'm a sponge myself, not a parent.

because my mantra is "rip people off shamelessly", I'm much closer aligned to the thieves and the "get what you can" types than anything else. I'm not a "good" person in any way. I stand for doing all the wrong stuff in an improved way. I don't see any value in shepherding.

this topic kinda bleeds into one I was going to write yesteday, where I can already feel myself turning into bert. I don't want anything to do with her growth process. I just want the finished product. I want her to figure it out for herself. it's so much important that she gets it herself than has someone steering her toward her goal.

it's not her goal if I'm steering. it's my goal and my desire for her which never works out well. when feeling the way *she* wants to feel is her own goal, then she's got it. she'll figure it out all by herself, and then after that, it's just ripping off good ideas for more characters and aspeccts for herself from others like me. see what I'm saying?

---

shepherding also implies good and bad in it construction ... as in, there's a "right" or good way to go, and then the bad or "wrong" way to go, if you don't heed the shepherd's advice. I make no such distinctions, because good and bad are constructs put into social and power structures by the "gods" (and they're still doing it), or order to exploit our ability to perceive the difference/contrast between two things (like good and bad).

good and bad don't exist. in fact, it's a large effort by the "gods" to keep us away from "bad" -- because in the "bad" stuff is usually where the most powerful and effective things lie. this is why it's my intention to "redeem" the bad things, stripping them from their evil/bad label and just using the principle in its raw form.

stripping away the physicality of the action, and just perceiving the vibrational exchange can turn some really awful things like killing, death, and things like that into something that eventually produces its opposite (life, growth, etc). they're two sides to the same coin and neither side of the coin should be feared. the bigger picture (2nd ray) can see how the death, killing, lies, destruction, eventually turns into the opposite, so it's important (I think) for a 1st ray to default to the 1-2-5 perspective.

after thinking about it a while, because my concepts are so diametrically opposed to the conceptual structure of the current social paradigm, I think I would be a pretty big disaster for me to begin "shepherding" anyone. for example, let's just take the "I want to see the finished product" aspect of bert -- well, the desire there is to *not* try and steer her but to let her come to her own conclusions. however, "I want to see the finished product" sounds pretty opposite to "enjoy the journey" or "have fun along the way" or "it's about the process, not the result" "beware of lust for results" etc.

I try and shy away from making too many action-oriented suggestions to anyone because they can always be taken out of context and instead teach the process and mechanism behind it (and how to see it). 3rd ray is about action, postures, positioning, etc. so I thought it was really funny that she refused to show any more than 1st position (it's also symbolically relevant). it feels like she's like me in that she doesn't want to perform until she feels ready and solid at it, but it's also a signal that she wants to stay in the realm of desire and not try to make anything too physical yet. directing someone from a position of action doesn't work too well for me, so instead I opt for the opposite side of the 3rd ray which is showing the process/form/structure/mechanism instead.

### 2022-12-20 22:51 - some thoughts on outdoors

it seemed significant to me to explain the concept of the symbol outdoors in the play "as you want it" (whatever you like, can't remember what exactly is the words).

outdoors is where the cold, rain stuff like that is. most people think of that as an inconvienence that they're not indoors during the cold or rain or whatever. well, in my long stints out watching stars (and many other times), I choose to be outside in the elements rathar than indoors.

it's an entirely different relationship with the outdoors if you *want* to be outdoors in the elements. I don't want to say that the outdoors elements are necessarily inconvenient either, because I actually learned to like them, and even started to gain an appreciation for the cold.

the "cold" is a temperature differential in heat/vibration between you and the outdoors. now I know both the outdoors and my body are quanties of heat/vibration, so it seems much easier to regulate my frequency knowing that now -- but that's what I did is I regulated my vibration such that the elements no longer bothered me. I didn't like to be around lots of people unless I was on drugs (drugs are something to focus on or loss of focus on the environment -- so drugs help a lot for learning this) -- and I learned that if I can become OK feeling with the elements, then likewise I can do the same thing with large crowds. I found this capacity of feeling OK with the elements is the foundation of a lot of things that I use, so outside is important.

when I was outside now, I was thinking about how inconvenient the cold is, and I remembered that I used to be outside for hours on end in this cold looking up at the stars and just hanging out/walking in the field.

there's another interesting aspect to the outside which is different from the indoors and city environments. concrete, and most of our structures direct the energy coming up out of the ground in weird ways and dampen its effects. way out in the field, because there is a pretty good energetic equilibrium, energy flows a lot easier. I get a lot of really impressive ideas out in the field, but my computer is here, so they don't get written down and epounded on a whole lot. one of the main advantages of writing like this is the feedback, so it kind of becomes a bit of a lecture or dialogue where I'm conscious of, and that audience is in some way affecting me (like a twitch streamer) -- and it's in those environments that concepts evolve. derailed, lol.

---

there are a dwindling number of professions that have a person outside, and one of those are the shepherds. I'm fairly certain that star watching (and interacting with the psychedellic landscape that pops in from the DMT) was a very popular pasttime. it's probably the origin of the word, "stargazing" and "staring" (star-ing means to keep looning for a really long time). I use shepherd techniques myself like star watching, and they're a great way to learn about life. here's a brief explanation (as I know it).

stars emit a continuous spectrum of light which is shifted slightly from our own, different ones emit more or less really high frequency stuff like gamma rays and much higher, and when they hit my eye, they cause my entire body to begin to vibrate at a much faster pace. normally, when this happens, your vision will improve dramaticlly, and I think that's because the brain is now, going at that higher frequency, is producing more DMT.

all that extra speed and stuff will strongly highten emotions that one experiences for some time after the experience. I'm sure there was also affection shared between the shepherds, because of that intense feeling of pleasure and at oneness that one can feel after looking into the stars for a while.

the increased emotion will also dramatically increase the speed at which you attract something, so life can be a bit chaotic. I like to think of this one as the trial by fire to do it the way I did it, because it's something like the movie "speed" when artificially stimulating one's perception to peer deeper, before one is ready to see all the extra stuff. the stuff that bothers you will bother you at even greater distances now, and all manners of ugly will be more apparent.

most people don't go that path though because it's kinda hard to navigate especially if you don't know it's all attraction. however, I still recommend it for those that want to try it. take the bumps easily and rememeber it's all attraction; you'll be fine. I like to think, "if I chose to do it, somewhere deep down, I know I'll succeed".

in fact, these hightened DMT experiences are very good at assuring you that it is all attraction, because all aspects of life starts to get really resonant in those faster speeds and it's easier to see how the resonation of one thing leads to another as oscillation more than a collision.

if that's what shepherding is, then I'm already a shepherd. I don't want anything to do with steering anyone else. all of these things I say are in effort to illuminate how easy it is to steer oneself perceptually.

### 2022-12-21 16:18 - I want to contemplate the symbols

I have reason to beleieve this will be helpful. I want to relate the symbols that I've seen in "[as you like it](/shakespere/as-you-like-it.md)" and elsewhere. I'm just going to tell you what I see. to state my intentions up front:

I'd like to rewrite the symbols to be more agrarian because:

- I'm much more of a farmer than a shepherd.
- the symbols need to be understandable to the common folk and plain in their perception (sorta like how disney does it).
- I think the shepherd is linked with animal slaughter, (which is another less than favourable aspect of enlil)
- farming is also vegan/vegetarian friendly.
- from my perspective, I strongly disagree with herding anyone.
- this is the age of extreme individuality, and we have to accept it.
  - personally, I practice hyper individuality, but I'm not going to try and make anyone else see it my way
- they need to actually reflect me and my grandiose sense of ambition, hyper-selifshness, and hyper-individuality as the good guy.
  - I'm kind of a "bad-guy" in every sense of the word. I'd like to talk about that more...

yesterday, when I was thinking about the bert stuff, I was really intending to get across that I (kenny) am kind of like bert, but from the female perspective. I'm helena, so I see bert how she sees him. you know, that's what makes me special to all of the "bad guys" that are out there -- is that I just don't really care at all about any of that stuff. I've watched so much south park, nothing, is really bothersome to me. I mean, me goodness, we had the office in chueca... it was bumpin, you know... crazy times. my point is, in addition to seeing these guys like helena does, I also represent *all* of berts qualities, but in feminine form.

therefore, if we accentuate my symbols that are the ideals, because of the way I am, the "bad guys" will now be perceieved indifferently to, just like I have to them. it's kinda the south park effect. my effect is to make something mind blowing seem completely normal. that's my quality, and anyone can do it.

as an example, yesterday, when I was talking about the "I want to see the finished product" thing as being bert, I'm fairly certain that would be patricia talking... know what I mean?

yes, the symbols are programmable, obviously.

---

OK, so there are two prometheuses, one is alalu and the other is vulcan (queen hera), and so in the symbols, this is rosalind, and she/he is trying to land orlando. right, so we have vulcan trying to land mars.

I lost you. well, that was fun.

### 2022-12-22 13:55 - a midsummer's night dream

I've been thinking about the symbols in "as you like it". it says, "woo'd in may and wed in december. first of all, the only place where it's summer in december is in the southern hemisphere.

I have so mucch to say. brb

### 2022-12-22 14:06 - a midsummer's night dream (take two)

the other thing to do is to combine the symbols with the problem plays. so for example, I've demonstrated that I'm helena, and she's meeting bert. in this combination of symbols, we're looking at "much ado about nothing" (I think) -- and in it, I think it was claudio that has a premarital affair, but this is strongly rejected and he's sentenced to death by the court. this is a sacrificial role, where he's accepting a future death. also, wood and woo'd in may seem to combine there.

I don't really like the symbol of his sacrificial role. I have a better "sacrifice". which I will relate. I can't relate it in pure symbols, because I don't have an imagination, so my environment is my imagination. therefore, real-life items will blend seemlessly, like it does in my experience.

---

this morning I was joking around with jaron, and I came across an idea of an "antiquarium" and I pictured it as the underground subway as illustrated in jason's video (forgot which one). in this underground setup, there's a giant aquarium with a sperm whale in it. I can see the sperm whale in there and it's in the shadows (light all focused is in the centre of the doughnut where the club/restaurant is) and so when looking from inside of the diner, the aquarium, because of the dimly lit underground vibe, the back of the aquarium is pitch black, and there are these trees that I grow. the underwater plants, and there are tons of these underwater trees and somewhere in there swimming amongst the trees, there is a sperm whale that occassionally looms a little more present.

this is an enormous money sink, but we think that if we build thing thing symbolically, they it'll attract the right guy to build our project -- remember, because this is combining the panza(?) symbols in don quixote and the adam symbols in ayli (as you like it). what this does is allows them to either make it happen, or not. both possiblities exist in equal validity. therefore, if they want to abort us and our project symbolically, they'd just redefine their symbols so then they can say, "nope, we have a better set of symbols now. this is what that means to us." and by "that" I mean the sperm whale and that stuff.

it's the worst idea ever.
the most ennormous money sink.
it's positively the worst idea ever.

OK, let me explain: I just love the idea of giving them full power, because they think they can do whatever they want, but because I'm growing so rapidly, I really think everything is going along fine, so it kinda forces them to keep up a bit. they learn what I'm saying, but don't apply it, so it's a bit of a game for me to put something that comes to me easily because I'm a good attractor, and then I put it right into the hands of a bunch of guys that think they don't know what they're doing. end result is, they make me feel like I don't know what I'm doing, when I really do, so I get the effect of looking like a buffon for them and then getting even better feeling like I know what I'm doing. I'm highly conscious.

I'm highly conscious because I'm fairly certain that our bodies run on consciousness. the nutrients that we eat are broken down into their vibrational consciousnesses that have a feeling to them. this strengthens our body on those frequencies, but when a lot of consciousness is flowing through you, our cells are nourished the feeling that is streaming that much consciousness.

for some, it may be a really strong knowing
that something really awful is up ahead.
consciousness is how much depth you see,
and it's expressed in the vision.

seeing high depth on unpleasant things, is
probably really annoying; but I can't slow down.
if I slow down, I die; just like you.

---

all of those symbols, we can keep or we can make new ones. I've suggested that we make new ones, right.

### 2022-12-22 14:38 - a midsummer's night dream (take three)

at any rate, the whole point of me saying all of that was to point out tha the other "funny" thing to think about which is that it actually *is* summer here in december. this too makes a dual reality, where both are equally possible symbolically.

---

also, I just want to rant a moment. I go so fast all the time, sometimes it's quite nice to go slow. I really don't mind it, and you know you can probably see that in my patience for jaron and other things like that. it's really kind of annoying to always have to go so fast. I like slow much more than you think.

I invented a whole symbol to represent this: maxine-foot-dragon. she drags her feet as much as possible. I make nosebook and the US military look rapid in comparison to how slow I like to take things -- which is linear velocity.

you can see what I mean when I play coi[^1]. pay attention to how it's more about my mental awareness than anything else. when I get tired, I lose that mental awareness. the last times I played, I didn't really have that mental awareness. that kind of expansion is what I consider linear velocity. if I have proper management techniques, then it's easy to expand and mind-bending speeds. that might be why coi has interested in me so much because it's allowed me to kind of look at the game in different forms of perception. in fact, one of the things I want to do is to go through all of the features that I desired for and arrange them into which form of perception it belongs to and adapt it to fit the conceptual interface in my mind... anyway

it's not fast, if you're capable of keeping up with it.

[1]: I just noticed this word "coi". it sounds like "coy" but it's more like I can see the factory. so, what if maybe instead of captain-of-3d, it was coi-3d? seems easier and I kind of like it (telling you I'm like a virus at how fast I absorb and then retransmit[^2]).

[2]: I had a few reactions on this. why wouldn't I be gaining consciousness of other attributes (I'm the perspective of the universe) that I'm also like? it seems perfectly logical to assume that I[^3] can gain consciousness, right?

[3]: who am I? that is what I ask myself, and it looks to me that I'm gaining consciousness on all 7 of the rays. I wouldn't limit it to 7 though, as perhaps more coming soon. who knows. I mean I guess it'll happen eventually, but it's probably something that can be delayed. like I said, I think of myself as captain-3d because I want to stay in 3d. I'm the make 3d better again guy, so you know, those ones will be growing upwardly, and so not something I control[^4].

[4]: what'll happen I think -- or at least the trap I see from their perspective is that they're setting up all of these crazy freaky (fearful) things to keep psychonauts out of the dimensions they're in. now, they have to build them to keep me out. but when it finally collapses, they'll live out their own nightmare realm. more dimensions they go now, more dimensions of nightmare for theirselves later. they make their own nightmares for theirselves. classic behaviour between humans, but it's especially notable here because of the non-resistantness of those dimensions, they're dealing with pure imaginal structures designed to keep the imaginal out. well, because I don't have imaginal, I don't see it either, and so being down here on earth in body form, those imaginal structures don't really bother me so much because I don't see anything. meaning their safeguards don't work on me because of my lack of imagination, cause otherwise I'd see them. see, so they keep my imagination off, which means here in physical, like I am now, I can access really high dimensional thought, essentially through the conceptual instead of the visual.

### 2022-12-22 15:26 -
### 2022-12-22 15:27 - the combination of symbols


### 2022-12-22 15:41 - redefining bert

one of the things that I was ... nevermind.

### 2022-12-22 15:43 - one of the things I whish is that I were asked more things

when I invade others' symbolic/thought space, like what happened above, I can't just leave with the symbols directly, but I have them conceptual form still. I'll probably talk about them in a monologue, but if I get asked questions, it's pretty easy to get the answer in a reasonable time to *anything*. I mean literally anything. it could you just pontificate on X, and that'd be fun, because then it's *my* thoughts because I (and others) and an emotional invenstment in it.

you know, I don't know if github is the best place for it, which is why I was suggesting a website where we could write (true) things which contain all of the possiblities, things. then we could explore subjects and also create identities for ourselves and others. you can see how those option lists will get really long with all sorts of twisted stuff on it, and it'll contain a lot of other things too, so people can use it to build profiles. I also didn't reveal that the possibilibies branch and can have other variables to the sentence. like full logical structure. we can write it all down. it's there, "everyone" knows about it, but only the really sick and twisted make their character profile out of *those* things. lol.

### 2022-12-24 16:44 - mars landing vulcan

I'd like to talk about two topics -- I can't remember the second one now so I'll start with this one.

the symbol vulcan landing mars (resalind and orlando) is one that I have been thinking about because I have both symbols of mars/orlando and also rosalind/ganymede. one could identify me asd being similar to orlando in that my "inheritance" (ie my network) is being held from me from my bigger brother (totally not a reference to "big brother" government and spy organisations). in it rosalind comes in as a sort of saviour to orlando a bit (I think that's how it goes anyway -- gonna rewatch the video summary soon). however, the main action is this idea of vulcan landing mars.

this, IMO is ass-backwards, as it doensn't fit the symbols very well. in the triads, sense this is the hidden 5th ray triad that I was talking about. in it, I am mars+anatau (orlando+helena) and it's helena that's bending reality to her will to get what she wants (orlando). this can be seen esoterically as my inner struggle to become externally mars (as in physically very capable and warlike and dominant -- ie their greatest fear/desire). I am of the opinion that presently, they are attracting the mars+anatau combo from me, and so that's the way we're going.

I do contain a lot of vulcan's symbols -- much more than mars, so it took the sirian guide telling me that mars+anatau is a 1st ray male, which is what I'm pretty close to in perspective, even though I can see all 7 with pretty good accuracy.

---

good intro. in the form of the symbols where I don't get to do the network, I would say that I'm mars. in the version where I do the network, I'm vulcan/rosalind. in the case of taking on the symbols of vulcan, I remain the "primary cup-bearer" for zeus (nick bottom), and I stay lame and stuff. I'm vulcan, not mars, which is connected, full of energy and in love with life.

this means that if I'm vulcan, I need to land a mars. I need to land a 1st ray male that has strong desire and is very physically focused. some examples of such men that I have met recently would be randall, marc, marty, andreas, robert, seriah, jon, etc. -- see if you can spot the pattern. so that's the kind of prototype that I'm looking for in mars. these are all of the guys that make a point and are right about things.

to understand the difference between the 1st and the 7th ray, we will think of bert as the receptive one, but then also think of bert as the one that has to be right about something. I believe that when we engace in "carnal acts" and other moments of high desire, this gets interpretted by the universe as desire to be right about something, whether it's symbols in a story or an idea.

look at my present siutation. I take in concepts (as vulcan) from these 1st rays and then I synthesise and grow them into a reality that is real. essentially, I'm here to prove all of you right. you'll nocice that I picked all of my examples as 1st ray males that I have in some way or another *proven* their main thing right (the build has to flow, escallating complexity, moon configuration, antarctic thing, etc.).. I am the egregore that they all have summoned to *prove* their thing right.

so, when I'm talking about mars landing vulcan or vulcan landing mars, I'm basically talking about what role am I playing. am I the lame guy that appears to have a very insignificant role, or do I play all of the implementation roles (nick bottom as mars). in the situation where I'm vulcan, there are many mars. in the situation where I'm mars, there are many vulcans.

in the symbols yesterday of allie, she becomes vulcan, and she'll find (or has) a friend(s) of aphrodite. I take on the form of anatau+mars, and so therefore, this immediately forms two triads of opposite types. first is the 1-5-7 where, there are many 7th ray females, and I play the emitter and vulcan the ground. allie, in that symbol plays the ground role of trying to figure out how to get the new perception the (1st ray) emitter has into the common viewpoint of the 7th ray female. these symbols seem quite well to me.

the other triad it creates is a second "first ray triad" (which the sirians defined as -1, +2, +-3-+) -- this time seen from the bottom up instead of the top down, so it's 1 is seen from a 7 perspective (mars, emitter), 3 to 5 (vulcan, ground), the ground in "first ray triad" is the 3rd ray (manual for how the universe works) -- but that's now perceived physical/conceptual standpoint of the 5th ray (vulcan) and the 7th ray female (celia). the thing that's missing here is a 2nd ray female. imagine then for a moment that kyle's daughter is a 2nd ray and she fits in perfectly.

I'm perfectly OK with both styles of reality (where I play vulcan or mars), and the other interesting thing to note is that they're not mutually exclusive either, meaning I can easily play mars with the girls and vulcan bith the boys. like nick, I don't limit myself to a single role.

### 2023-01-07 04:57 - coriolanus

youtube suggested me this video and I felt inspired to watch it. I recognised the plot being very similar to my own present situation. coriolanus is me. rome is nosebook.

I hate the people of nosebook. they annoy me a lot of times, and they don't at other times. my approval of them is very conditional. I suppose I could be seen as a hero there. his nemesis is probably most closely related to zaryn or the tech industry in general. I'll retell the story from my perespective.

I see the volscians defeat as probably similar to my initial establishment of a social network in spain (tuenti). it could also be seen as my initial appearance on nosebook. in both cases, there was effort to change the people's perception of me, such that I would be seen as not suitable to run the company or whatever happened in nosebook.

I speak my heart and I don't really have much interest in trying to say the right words to the right people. my mom is a central figure in both skirmishes too, as in the tuenti skirmish, it was how I should treat my family differently than the rest of the world, elevating them to a higher status. I won't do it.

later on, the skirmish over nosebook is whether it exists or not. she believes that I need to follow her guidelines and believe her unwaveringly. I will not.

it may coming a time soon when I go back to team up with my arch nemesis (silicon valley or some kind of tech thing) to defeat nosebook, and make my own social network. it's possible that my mom (or some other familiar type character that will try to ease my hatred for rome), but I will not. maybe the play is right, and I'll eventually capituate, like coriolanus does, and that'll be my end -- who knows but, from my perspective now, I'm writing this now to *prove* that I will not capituate to the suggestions of my mother. I will continue on until rome is destroyed. I will have my way.

### 2023-01-07 07:00 - comedy of errors

I can see a lot of symbols in here, but I can't quite make sense of them. the two inns are half-horse and half-man (centaur), which represents the wild untamed man -- meanwhile, the phoenix is the fire bird that gets destroyed (loses the battle) and then is reborn continually from the ashes. I see these two twins as being similar in my own two sides.

on one side, there is the kenny that is untamed and wild. I sleep on the floor, I don't quite meet hygene standards, impossible to control, etc. I believe this is one side that nosebook capitalises on a lot.

the other side is my phoenix side. you can't hold me down. I just keep getting back up and going at it another angle, etc. from the perspective of nosebook's narrative, I'm sure these sides sort of appear to be in contradiction to each other.

AND -- because it's all attraction, the different narratives create different expectations from people, and so different people attract different things from me. from my perspective I notice this all the time. in one moment with one person, I seem to have the phoenix costume on, and then with other people I seem to behave like a wild untamed crazy person.

to try and combat this, I try my absolute hardest to try and keep my own ideology consistent, and just let the actions be whatever anyone is attracting out of me.

---

I'll need to watch the play to get some more details, cause for example, emilia is from *babylon* -- so the names are important.

e to point out the ephesians thing from my perspective. when I was younger, I noticed my birthdate in matthew:

> But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

I subsequently looked up my birthdate in all the other books to see what it was. I remember I didn't find anything else quite as notable, cept I did notice ephesians 5 also talks about marriage...

> In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.

I did subscribe to this idea, that I would love my wife like I love myself. that is a very bad idea. very very bad idea. the way that I love myself, I don't think anyone would ever want to be "loved". I am an extremely harsh taskmaster for myself, holding extremely high standards. I can't possibly expect to ever love anyone else the way I love myself.

you know, I'm one of the few people (in fact, I know of zero others) that actually like theirselves and hold theirselves in high regard. all of the people that I've ever tried to hold in high regard reject my elevated opinion of them, or they'll choose to take advantage of it. I simply have not ever found a way to ever hold anyone else in as high of regard as I do myself. I am the only person I trust. I actually believe myself more than I believe others, and I don't think that's ever really possible to have have that kind of love for someone else. they will let you down.

as a result, I try and see others as a reflection of myself. if I see something in you that I don't like, I'm really noticintg an aspect of myself I don't like showing itself to my through another person (cause otherwise it wouldn't bother me). I've found this works wonders because as I've learned to actually like myself, I find that liking/loving others is *extremely* easy. I think of it like me recognising things that I like about myself in others, and it works really well.

you'll notice that the verse there says "love their own bodies" (I used NIV cause that's what I grew up with), and that is the main source of my difficulty -- because here's the centaur. I don't really love my body all that much. I mean, it's OK, I guess -- but I see it as a vehicle or something of pure function -- nothing more. it gets me from A to B and it allows me to think, talk and move around, but for all practical purposes, I don't really *love* my body in any way.

my body is much more like the phoenix, in that I've had numerous failures in my body, but yet it continues to return to rise up from the difficulty and somehow continue on. I attribute this to my strong personal identity, and not to the great care and love that I give to my body -- which is where we get to the matt 5:28 part of the thing. matt 5 is all about the reflective nature of reality, and in this verse it's saying that the things that I picture in my mind are real as if I have committed them -- meaning that the way that I perform and think about things in my head is the same as how it is in reality. I pondered this considerably growing up.

later on around 29-30yo, there was a book I read called "project superman" which helped me to understand this concept. it's a story, likely embellished, about a guy named andy pero. in it, the US govt put him through all sorts of difficulties, which would have killled any normal person, but andy would go in his mind to a magical place and allow his body to begin healing. in short the way he perceived his body in his mind, reflected the image into actuality. he was a living phoenix, by using the power of his mind.

I think these represent symbolically two opposites, but the symbolic opposites are hidden in the comedy of errors.

---

> how do you love your wife as yourself, when you're losing your own identity?

you asked this question... some counter-questions:

- is my identity defined by me, or my narrators?
- is my behaviour a reflection of my identity or a reflection of what is expected of me?
  - if what's expected of me, who's expectations?
    - my own?
    - the narrators'?
    - or, the audience's?

#### notes

dromio sounds like romeo. name could be a combination of romeo and dionysus
antipholus sounds like antithesis
luciana sounds like lucid (mental state) -- so it's probably important to note that syracyuse antithesis falls in love with lucidity (the non "one flesh", wild centaur twin)

similarity to theseus:

Solinus, duke of ephesus -- (sol invictus)
ariadne -- adrianne

Theseus is a prominent character as the Duke of Athens in William Shakespeare's plays, A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Two Noble Kinsmen. Hippolyta also appears in both plays.

theseus:
  - son of poseidon/enki
  - founder/hero of athens
  - is the one that slays the bull/minotaur (like mithras)
  - hippolyta is his mother, the amazon queen. (her name is something of female horse -- wild woman)

theseus' second wife, phaedra is also the daughter of king minos.

theseus, after decapitating the bull/minotaur, escapes with the young athenians (pied piper of hamelin?) and ariadne and phaedra. theseus abandons ariade, where dionysus finds her and marries her

### 2023-01-07 09:22 - winter's tale

polym - bohemia
leontes - sicily

#### 2023-01-07 15:02 - acting hermione

while watching sara's video on how to act the part for hermione, I had so many thoughts running through my head -- some of which I got reactions to (which is why I'm writing this). first, I noticed that she started to get emotional as she "connected with the character", which was really really weird for me, because in that moment, she was imagining herself in the place of hermione. I tried the same thing, but I felt nothing. the scene doesn't evoke any emotion for me because punks like leontes have their ideas of what reality is, and there's no way to change it.

I've completely stopped getting worked up emotionally about someone believing I'm this or that (whore or whatever). her reputation is what's on the line here and this is an insult to her character by someone that she loves... I get that, but the entire scene rings hollow for me because she's either *not* as innocent and perfect as we're led to believe, or she in some way expected leontes to suspect her of being a whore. it's all attraction, so somehow she invited that reality to happen -- somehow. sara mentions that this is completely unfair because unlike othello, who had (that evil guy) whispering into his ear all the horrible things, this time there was no cause for leontes to come to such an irrational conclusion. sara's emotion is clearly caused because sara is looking at it all wrong, and her inner being (source) sees the same situation differently. if she were to see the situation like her source sees it, it wouldn't cause her any emotion (it's all perception). I'll leave that as an exercise to the actor to figure out how to perceive the situation without an emotional response.

I also strongly disagreed with the dialogue that shakespere put in hermione's mouth. I get that she feels like there's no more reason to live now as the stuff that's valueable to her has been taken away from her, as this has happened to me a number of times myself. there's no reason to get upset about anything there because first of all she attracted it, and so by changing her perception of the situation -- first by accepting that it *is* attracted in some way (cause it manifested), then she's off to a great start to turning that missing valuables into more valuables. in those types of situations, we're often so fixated on the loss, all we can do is see the thing that's missing, we can't even imagine that something far better could ever make something right again. once accepting that it's all attraction, she has all the power back and she can attract something that will reflect how she feels.

if she keeps feeling miserable and fixated on the loss, there will always be that loss hanging in the back of her mind, attracting more and more losses that cause her to amplify that loss feeling until she's finally actually willing to die or change her perception. there are so many wonderful and nice things in life, that it's just not worth it to fixate on the things she's not feeling good about.

why does she drag herself through the mud and get all worked up over something she has no control over (leontes perception) -- I don't know -- but I'm speaking now from probably a lot more experience than she is -- and I had someone to remind me that it's all attraction, so I'm not really interested in trying to get anyone to change how they perceive things.

everyone attracts according to their own perception, and it's an interesting place to end the story, because it kinda makes it feel like there is some resolution to the situation -- but I guarantee you that if the story were to go another 5 acts, a very similar thing would repeat because leontes probably didn't really change his victim attitude. in fact, I'm pretty sure that it'll repeat because paulina is holding leontes in expectation of doing such a thing by continually nagging him about his problem.

when my mom nags me about a problem, she expects that I'll continue to do the same thing over and over. she can ask me hundreds of times to clean my room, but until she actually allows me to have a clean room, instead of constantly nagging me or thinking that I'll never have one, it's nearly impossible for me to have a clean room. I have to overcome my own resistance and also hers to make a change. this is in fact why so many apologies have such little effect; simply because by apologising I'm acknowledging that the person is the way that I believe them to be, and then saying it's OK to keep doing this. I want you to change -- but *we'll see* if you *actually* change. my experience is that aplogies are for politicians, corporations, and people that want a fast improve feeling -- and then they just hide it better next time.

yes, I know my expectation for people to not change when apologising is also my own attraction, and so I do cause myself a lot of people to not change with my own expectation. I'm aware of it. that's why I'm a "bad guy". I hold mom to the same expectation of never being able to change as she does me. we're a perfect vibratioal match for each other :) it's fun playing games. I'm kinda evil a bit knowing the law of attraction so well -- but don't tell anyone...

#### 2023-01-07 15:36 -  breaking the law and authorized realitites

as mentioned above, the story does not provide enough information for us to understand how hermione attracted leontes illogical and irrational explanation, so we're left to think that this is unfair and an injustice. in reality such a situation would never happen unless attracted. the way that shakespere, cervantes, and other authors changed our timeline is to allow people to begin allowing such impossible realities to happen. they wouldn't normally happen, but because we read them in a book, visualised them, acted them, etc. they became real for us, just like they did for sara, and so now that they appear real and plausible, the author authorized the reality, and we allowed it to happen by believing it's possible.

the only way to get around such rampant authorization of law (of attraction) violating realities, is to become a bit robotic like I've done and to see everything as a reflection of a person's conceptualisation/emotional relationship that they have with reality. when I see a person complaining about something unfair that happened -- like let's say jaron's situation with jerrica -- I know instantly what jaron's concept of reality is based on how he feels. he thinks that I can/do come in and wreck something he's looking forward to with my own selfishness. by believing that I do that, all of my actions were perfectly valid. other people think I'm slightly psycho, and further others think that I'm out to reveal all of the news efforts to cover things over with a false physical sensation of valour to a gunman that is "saving" or doing something heroic. the heroism makes it feel like the whole situation is justified with a narrative and sensation of a heroic resolution to a an awful situation.

hollywood are really good at inventing narratives that break the law of attraction. it's pretty easy to see them if you use your emotion to feel out what are the concepts/feelings that were used in the creation of the reality/narrative. what attracted the thing? you can *always* feel it. nobody can ever hide what is the attracting concepts to any manifestation of reality.

### 2023-01-07 15:51 - reversal

(mirrored numbers too) (this probably belongs in another section, but for now here is good)

one of the things that I noticed in the last few entries here and in some of my vocal commentary while watching' tim's super duper excellent and thought provoking summaries[^1] is that I've begun to pick to kinda pick apart some of shakespere's plays from my perspective. I think some were a bit shocked to find that I would have done the coriolanus play even more differently, sacking rome and all of my unbelieving family (probably making me perceived as I'm even more of a tyrant than leontes). or how much I dislike the shepherding/steering imagery. I don't really like the symbols that shakespere puts into his plays, because they're not really very realistic. they're designed to create more drama between us -- which is totally fine, as I've begun to recycle some of shakespere's techniques myself -- not because I'm trying to mess you guys up, but because if I you were actually paying attention to what I'm saying, you'd notice that I'm purposefully attracting situations and things from people in accordance with my expectation, on a whole lot of harmless subjects. some of them I'm doing on purpose and some of them I'm just becoming aware of them myself as they happen (no examples are coming to mind right now), but you all are just as subject to my expectations as I am to yours.

I'm just as capable of expecting unwanted from you all just as much as anyone else -- and it's actually my belief that from a longer distance perspective (not quick fix or reactionary), I most certainly planned that I wouldn't be going into a steady situation for quite a while. it's easy to look at good conditons and feel good, but it's not as easy to feel good situations when the conditions aren't what are wanted (like hermione). I'm reminded of two things: first, was a joke that colin jost said on weekend update about the sequel of the passion of the christ being a good and long one. I forget how the joke went, but the basic idea is that it should really drag out as long as possible (all's well that ends well, right?). the other one I'm reminded of was one I remembered looking into theseus -- which is the colourful piper of hamelin. the story doesn't explain why the ones running the town never paid him for his service of getting rid of the rats -- but I imagine that the rats are not small vermin, but probably something more like mafia or some some power structure. it's probably the same as moses and the pharoah ("let my people go") where it was actually moses' expectation of the pharoah (and the pharoah's inability to surpass moses' energetic expectation) that caused such a disturbance (expectation is a powerful thing) -- and so I feel like I'm doing the same thing. I'm holding you guys in a holding pattern with my expectation for as long as you want to be there.

the different symbols that I'm presented with, I take them and I adopt/assimilate the bits that I like and leave the rest (like with anyone you meet at a new age confrence) -- and so far I'm not really liking the ones I've been presented with so far. not good enough!

ever since I figured out the promethian perpspective (desire to be right), I've used that as my #1 tool to continually reject the symbols that I don't like. not good enough! better symbols, or compliance with my expectations... lol.

---

anyway, I'm done having fun. earlier I was having a hard time getting to sleep, and nearly every time that I almost fell asleep, I was leaving my body -- but not like in a good way -- in a way that felt like my whole body was being shocked to keep me confined to the physical. I distinctly associate the sensation with the numerous "memories" that I have of dying out while watching stars.

the sensation of death for me while watching stars is my body starts convulsing violently for a very brief time and then I start to feel red and warm (lots of stinging/tingly sensations), as I relax and drift to sleep -- is how I remember it anyway, and it's caused because nosebook doesn't want me to see the astral. well, last night, I had a strange interaction where with seriah -- and I don't know if I appeared there in astral or not, but it *felt* like I was there, so I'm losing the container of my body and can start to go anywhere I want -- which is kinda what they don't want. I mean I could fly over to remi's house, pass through the walls and probably startle her pretty badly... it'd be a fun thing for her to fear to have happen :)

anyway, we'll see if I can get to sleep without dying, cause that would be pretty bad. the experience happened right after I explained to sara and conjured the emotional state of hermione where I recognised that there is nothing I can do about leontes/nosebook/rome's perception of me (my reputation), and so I just decided that I'd prefer to die, rathar than to try and defend my honour or reputation. I'm dead, so perceive me however you want.

[1]: *seriously* extremely awesome because when he paraphrases the dialogue, I "get" the play/poem from his perspective and he has a very detailed grasp of these things, so it's extremely mind expanding and thought provoking. don't be like coriolanus and unable to accept praise... it's really cool man :)

### 2023-01-14 04:48 - paris, menelaus, and mars

first, I noticed that helena is sorta like aphrodite/gnexicat, and then that makes menelaus mars, then vulcan is hera. that was interesting, then I noticed that menelaus and paris are like negative aspects of general form of 7th ray male. then, I was thinking about aphrodite/helen as being also negative aspects of a 7th ray female.

it seems to me like the book is saying, these are the characters that we're breeding: +/-7th rays and queen heras (-5+). finally, to hold everything in place, zeus (+3) and athena (-3) set the rules.

#### 2023-01-14 23:20 - would paris be a 5th ray?

as you're describing the character of paris, I noted that two guys popped into my head. one was ricky (from when I owned a bar in spain) and the other was [curtis (an archeologist youtuber)](TODOK yt link). just noting this because I never really thought of paris as a 5th ray. very interesting.

### 2023-01-14 23:23 - the 7th ray triad

right, so that makes the triad: helen/aphrodite (reflector), paris/vulcan (ground), and menelaus/mars (emitter). it's no wonder these three are recipe for disaster. lol.

### 2023-01-14 23:42 - you know, I still see paris as a poorly formed instantiation of mars

the idea here is that a symbol has a number of traits. you can see this in me where I have a lot of really negative qualities (like yesterday I joked about how I was a control freak), but these flaws aren't really rendered as a negative aspect of me. in other situations, a reconfiguration of my aspects would lead to a really dreary individual, even malicious and warlike. instead, I'm powered from within by this unquenchable desire to just do stuff. like, I have no idea why on earth I'm so obsessed with making a social network -- right but this mcguffin is what pushes my narrative along. it's the magician's wand I'm sure from some perspectives. you see, I have to do it; somehow; it needs to be done. you know it feels sorta imperative to me. I have this never-ending march toward ever higher complexity. it's kenny that is always trying to simplify -- cause from my *desire* perspective, these sorts of things just sorta *have* to happen. you know how some women get when they decide that something *has* to happen? after that a common conclusion is to add, and I'll be upset if it doesn't. other conclusions, like I do is, to just let it evolve into the next thing. that's what makes women's perspective feel like effort, cause they need this exact thing; this exact manifestation, just how I want it (kinda a bit like agamemnon) -- which, btw has a lot of female default programming built into it, like if I quit and they keep winning, I'm gonna look bad, so I need zeus to make sure they know they *need* me. so many mothers invite difficulty for the people they support by trying to ensure they're still *needed*.

so anyway, the part about paris, even if he is a 5th ray, can also reflect in a 7th ray. you know, like think about some of those like jocks or whatever that are all pretty boys -- at least, that's how it was in the movies, anyway. what I mean is, that it's just as possible for mars to take on vulcan's attributes, if they allow theirselves to let vulcan's attributes *flow through* their personality, rathar than *out of*. it's funny that they evoke the muse as well, because the idea is that the essence or lifeforce, concepts, etc. are all flowing *out of* the muse, and then *flow through* the poet, actor, singer, etc. interesting.

### 2023-01-14 23:59 - a funny vision

when I was outside just now, I had this funny vision happen aftter smoking, and in it, I was just this raging beast, that just won't stop or slow down -- like this tidal wave that can't really be stopped. it was really cool.

maybe I am the beast's first form, but that definitely doesn't stop anyone from joining in on that. I offer many ways to see this concept:
  - I've touched on universal consciousness, seeing thruough the perspective of the universe.
  - I've talked about it from a resistance and attraction way of seeing it: when expansion is happening faster than resistance (like a child), you become unstoppable.
    - my resistaance, for example is reducing faster than I can add resistance.
    - I'm *purposefully* ridiculous to create interactions with you guys *to add resistance* because I'm already going pretty fast. if I don't, I'd lose track of physical reality. nosebook keeps me grounded.
      - I don't meditate because if I do, I go too fast.
      - I'm reducing resistance consciously, meaning that activities like meditating are making me go faster than I feel like I can control, which means I would need to add resistance to feel comfortable.
      - I prefer to coast effortlessly than to constantly be putting the gas (meditatiting) and then pressing the brakes when going too fast (adding my own negative "safety" resistance)
      - I do enjoy my own thoughts a lot more than I enjoy no thoughts.
      - I usually think of things like improvements, things I like, things I'm getting to understand better, understanding another dimension to perception.
      - abraham said,
        "we'd rather have you in a state of appreciation, than in a state of meditation;
        it's so good to think your thoughts while in a state of appreciation." (paraphrase)
  - I've touched on the idea of seeing things "through the eyes of source" or perceiving lower resistance versions of the same thing.
  - voracious desire, going infinite, etc.
  - all of these things, are all talking about increasing the speed at which I attract things, not by pressing the gas, but by *lowering resistance* or changing my perception/perspective.

I could see myself as gaining speed, and no matter how many things hanging on to me, or how many parasites or whatever are happening, I'm still continuing to accelerate. it's that unstoppable feeling: the feeling that unless I sabotage myself with my own perception, I'm going to just keep getting more and more wanted.

at that moment, I see that the only person that can stop me is me. nobody else can stop me. I'll just keep growing and continuing to have a greater and greater influence on those around me (like a star). I'm like this unstoppable beast.

wow, what a detailed and weird vision.

#### 2023-01-15 00:13 - a conscious person is a beast

think about it: you're expanding faster than accumulating resistance. that means that every moment going forward, a conscious person, I'm becoming more than I ever was before. you can't stop that.

### 2023-01-15 01:03 - preliterary and procomentary analysis of paris

I decided I wanted to try and use my ability to "zolt" concepts, and take a look at my perspective on paris is. in the process, I think I found a novel way to perceive triads. first things first.

let's begin with the idea of a reflecter (female), a character (emitter), and an actor[^1] (ground). paris/vulcan is in the place of the actor. it's helpful to see the actor as a reflection of the charactor, omg I'm getting really confused with the er and or -- meanwhile the music is playing latin in the background, and I don't remember my declensions, but I'm sure they may have either to do with gender or person. anyway -- the point is, that the actor is the actors' rendition of the charactor. he's like the sidekick or the "right hand man" or the "primary cup bearer". so in this case paris is supposed to be a sort of reflection or a repersonification of menelaus in paris.

so, remember that menelaus is the emitter or charactor, meaning that attributes *flow out* of his personality. for paris or the ground (the body, the vessel) attributes will *flow through* him; he is going to be pretending (acting) to be what menelaus would like to see; but, ultimately he doesn't measure up to menelaus' strong charactor qualities, so he's probably going to never get menelaus' approval. he'll be flaky, get out of it, be busy, have something other to do, than to face the things that scare him -- and there's *a lot*.

they create their own problems because they fear they can't be *all* of these character traits in the character that they are not, which is a literal impossiblity[^2]. therefore, their real fear is actually to never: measure up, be approved, validated, or accepted; or, in my case, a strong need to be right. paris however, is obviously still pretty far away from needing to be right; he's still young and inexperienced enough to still not need to be right. (abrupt, wasn't it) if only these actors could know that they are their own biggest critic; and all the critisim that comes from the outside is only an external realisation of thier own self-critisism.

[1]: I spelled it with an 'e' because I wanted it to match character. I have future plans for charactor and also reflector, as I already see them coming, but their meaning isn't apparent to me yet.

[2]: in math, only the identity is the same and everything else is slightly different. you are already an identty to yourself. becase all the different you's are all referent to itself (relative). therefore, all identities are all just diffrent angles/aspects/ideas/vibrations to the same point/matrix/vector/etc. therefore, it's impossible for an actor to ever do it 100% perfectly, for only the thing itself could mimic itself perfectly.

#### 2023-01-15 01:36 - followup: reflectors

I totally forgot to mention that the reflector and the actor are nearly he same and struggle with the inibiligy to be a "good" reflector -- because often times a person does not like theirselves, so they sometimes can really lash out at their reflections. unfortunately, it's not often the case that the charactor can recognise their own reflection, and often times blame their own reflection for being terrible.

therefore, a "good" reflector/actor probably wants to change their reflection to be more the angle the other one is looking for -- attraction. the reflectors are the most beautiful. people love looking at theirselves and when I'm a reflection of you, you can see yourself, and if I make you look good, I like you[,] and myself.

### 2023-01-15 01:47 - menelaus is described as athena

when he hit the ground fully armed, this is an author'd image that I'm seeing, but the concept is clearly an assocation of menelaus to athena. athena, I think is the 3rd ray female -- the feminine counterpart to zeus. this is a world without desire (1) or a saviour (big picture, 2) yet, so the reality matrix we're living in in this story is the one defined by zeus/ra and athena/venus.

now, what that has to do with menelaus, I'm eager to find out. this poem is hilarious, btw.

I'd also like to mention that these two reality matrixes are very interesting and opposite. jupiter/ra is considered to be associated with space. he's the "ruler". his "consort" was vulcan. saturn is the "consort" of venus/unessa/athena. this the entire "reality" of time.

when you think about what time and space are, they're just vibrations in a frequency spectrum -- both space and time. the more harmonious two vibrations in these spectrum are, means their closeness/distance from the other vibration in both space and time. so one planet's harmonics probably converge in the spectrum of space, and the other in the spectrum of time. as such, it feels like they each rule that aspect -- but we create our own reality. I love how the poem is a giant joke because you put all of the worst configurations together of ideas, this is what you get. it's like watching the three stooges install a shower and then tacking on to the end: see, this is why you shouldn't try to install a shower. these guys are the *worst* reasons for why war is a terrible idea... LOL

#### 2023-01-15 02:14 - loved by the war god

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/XxSrwnBZr_k?list=PLIlatssdqY5Ny9xspJqRg9jthBzafAf_l&t=728)

venus is said to have been loved by the war god (mars). menelaus is venus/athena in this story.

### 2023-01-15 02:17 - paris is definitely 7th ray

above somewhere I misidentified him as 5th -- but you know 7th has all of 5th and 6th too included in the same perception (everything is a reflection of your concept (and/or imagination) of it).

anyway, as I was thinking about it, paris is thoth. in the triads, saturn (+-4) the actor is with thoth (+7), the emitter/character of the group. with them, the reflector is venus/menelaus/athena (-3).

then you have zeus/ra (+3), hera/vulcan (-5+), and athena (-3) as some sort of reflection of menelaus (-3) paris (+7) and hector (-+4?)... I should probably write the different triads that I see and make a list. I feel like I understand the book from a completely diffrent way of looking at narrative evolution with character triads.

### 2023-01-15 02:28 - astronomical impacts

this is also an author'd image I'm seeing, because when he's describing the battle of paris (mercury) and menelaus (venus), the reason why venus cries out to jupiter saying that he should be the most deadly, is telling a tale of venus also interacting with mercury. here we have another triad as well: mercury/paris, venus/menelaus, and mars/agamemnon?/achilles?

anyway, this story was used to pass down astronomical information about our solar system; now, whether those things really happened or not is hard to say, but it seems very important that this astronomical data is included. it's probably something to do with tuning this narrative humans (the dreamers) to have corresponded with a specific planetary interaction in history.

as velikovski says, "people witnessed the birth of venus" (paraphrase) -- now whether that was the *actual* planetary event, or just a story of it, we don't really know or really have a way to verify. "now", is like a tiny little island (much smaller than 6ky) where literally *anything* could have happened to bring you to the present. it could be this narrative or another.

anyway, it's an interesting idea to explore how the saturnians use narrative to create, split, and merge timelines. like, it's really important for some reason this astromical data for some reason -- I dunno if it's to get a sufficiently traumatised substrate for the narrative to unfold into. not totally sure.

#### 2023-01-15 02:44 - aphrodite is earth

so we have paris/mercury, menelaus/venus, and ra/jupiter. I believe that mercury probably came from saturn, and venus came from ra/zeus/jupiter so this is a sort of standoff.

we also know by looking up into the sky, that apollo (-2) is between (in a triad with) venus (-3) and mercury (+7)

#### 2023-01-15 02:49 - mercury and ganymede have a lot in common

ganymede/vulcan/hera and mercury are different aspects of the same thing like jupiter and saturn are of dividing the conceptual into time and space. jupiter exerts more influence over apollo (-2) than saturn does. saturn's consort (venus) is also the progeny of jupiter, which is in a triad with apollo along with saturn's emitter, mercury. things are tangled.

mercury and vulcan define another set of limits[^1], just like jupiter and saturn define time and space. it's kind of interesting because it looks to me like they're like the hardware necessary (think of planets like frequency spectrum hardware), they determine the spectrum and how wide it is (ruler). obviously all things create harmonics of other things, but there is always a concentration at certain frequencies (spectroscopy). they determine the frequential qualities of that spectrum/medium.

[1]: I think the spectrums that they're involved with might play into ... I'm still working out the theory, because mercury (+7) is in a triad with the sun (-2) so mercury probably modulates the spatial/physical 3d aspect of reality, meanwhile venus (+3) is going to be the symbols that we utilise in this narrative reality. the other day, I was thinking about venus as being the location of another such planet where their society has symbols handed down to them from their leaders which match the symbols on our planet (explains wierd dtp stuff, and idea that venus is the weaver of fabrics, and that she sets up the symbolic qualities rathar than "qualities" -- conceptual/physical qualities -- huh?). anyway, the point is, I noticed that venus is more time based (the sequence of symbolic interactions), whereas mercury modulates something about the physical apparition of those symbolic types.

### 2023-01-16 02:34 - powerless, against fate

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/XxSrwnBZr_k?list=PLIlatssdqY5Ny9xspJqRg9jthBzafAf_l&t=1380)

this is an interesting take on the idea, because powerless against fate means *narrated*, not *narrator*. we have arrived to a similar such moment in life, and I may point out that "narrated" means that we have no control over fate. early humans had thier fate tied to the planets -- so they were a big deal to have the planets working right to get the best fate; in a sense, the planets narrated early humans' lives. nowadays, the narrators are marketing and product ads, music, culture, technology, etc. (oh yeah, and hollywood).

for example, my life I am completely powerless against fate. I can only perceive my circumstances the way I want to because I can't *really* change my fate. my destiny changes with my focus and my conceptualisation/perception of all inputs.

### 2023-01-19 19:53 - with hey, ho, the wind and the rain

a concept arrived to me while listening to the last line of this song. I'll try to describe it.

yeah, the song describes problems, most notably with women. I don't know twelfth night yet (look at it next), but clearly this song is punctuating the ... difficulties of women (from a man's perspective) -- as a friend of mine would often say, "the world is a difficult and dangerous place" (it's not designed to be easy, though for some people it appears so)

anyway, at the end, I had this concept that I've been developing. I used to listen to abraham a lot and they would constantly say, "we'll wedge our message into the crack". also, yesterday, I was watching an interview about "the chorus" (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/ricpAYynp7s)), and in it, katie channels similar to esther hicks -- and she's describing her process. she explains that when she is receiving the idea, she usually gets the whole download in an instant (exactly like I'm describing to you what just happened to me at the end of this song), and it's a group consciousness, and the really non-physical ones are really fun and joyful and stuff, but then there are some other more physically focusud ones in there too that kind of slip their messaged into the cracks. hold that concept.

when I looked into shakespere[^1] and how he did his story process, what I could tell is that it's very similar to what katie experiences. those really joyful beings and ther bouncing balls of light that terence talked about, and a number of my own experiences came to mind (mine don't have visuals though) -- and so when shakespere would begin to write a play, he would just build the character archetypes in his mind, and then then just let them interact with each other. the characters would say lots of silly and meaningful things to each other, and different aspects would be desired and altered. it's like the theatre is in his imagination with these various ultra-sytlised figures interacting (it's kinda surreal).

this state of mind is possible when the brain has extremely high amounts of DMT in it, and I think that most, if not all of them were gay, and that's how they shared this interactive visual space.

the next thing I noticed when watching sara's videos, is that all of the really deep stuff is under a layer of toilet humour. I really do think that "source", "the chorus", or whatever you want to call that non-physical aspect of universal consciousness really does "wedge their message into the crack" (lol). I think the toilet humour was hilarious to shakespere and that was probably the easiest way to keep his players interested and having fun while delivering these deep ideas.

the reason why I think that shakespere has had such a strong influence on society -- is because it's pretty enlightened and has a lot of hidden messages encoded into it. I myself employ a lot of humour as a surface feature, often times making fun and joking about less (or significantly more) resistant ways to look at the same situation.

the other theory that I have is that a sort of "new hominid", a human with differing capabilities, actually sprang into existence around the time of shakespere -- and these are humans like me and you (and likely the players and their entourage sperad this a lot), which are capable of interpretting and superimposing symbolic and conceptual archetypes and ideas from a narrative over real-life, in the sense that these narrative elements are easily manipulated by the powers that be (the wind and the rain), and so like a cork floating about in the middle of a massive tempest, we're thrown about since the beginning of life and time by these narratives.

narratives tint how we see reality and superimpose the "moral" of the narrative over the top so that we expect that sort of "poetic justice" to happen, when all along, when you look just underneithe, the superficial layers, past the toilet humour and things like that, it's all perceptual.

---

as such, I think this song is inspired, and the line says it all (looking behind the toilet humour), that all of the world and it's difficulties is "one"[^2] and that "we" (source, the chorus, shakespere/terence's mind, non-resistant "all" consciousness) strive to "please" (as in make a wonderful reality for you) every day.

for me, when I read the song at the end, I can see how even through all of the wind and the rain, they still find a way to wedge their message into the crack.

[1]: I liteally made the realisation yesterday that I spell *shakespeare* incorrectly. I just noticed it just now as well, but for the same reason why I'm probably not going to go and try to fix all the missspellings, is that my concept (shakespere) is different than the reality instantitation of "shakespeare".

[2]: the word "one" here gives me two concepts: first of unity -- as in togetherness, oneness, or completeness and second of "won" -- as in awarded, received, rewarded.

### 2023-01-19 20:47 - 12th night notes

- 12th night is the movement between christmas (birth), and epiphany.
  - I doubt the play *actually* spans a 288hr timeframe.
  - it's likely referring to the birth of something, following a narrative up to its baptism/epiphany
    - like the "bath" sonnets at the very end, a stark contrast to the belaboured convincing of the fair youth to procreate)
    - cupid may even have a similar appearance as "valentine"
- duke orsino (who was probably with queen elizabeth on opening night) is in love with olivia, but she does not requite his love for her.
  - it's quite possible that olivia is similar conceptually to queen elizabeth, and so this would be a pretty good joke to play on elizabeth from shakespere's perspective.
- viola and the captain come from a shipwreck (disaster of some kind) and are "washed up" on shore (not doing so well from the disaster)
  - voila has a brother (sebas) that she believes has drowned in the previous disaster
  - viola (the name), for me has the concept (voilar - love forcefully in spanish) associated with it.
    - the idea appears to me that she is forcefully doing something to get what she wants (like helena), but also she is the victim of the same force (reflective) on herself, as she feels like she's being guided or steered by some outside force.
  - I'm also reminded of the "voilator" album, which has my faviourite song in it, "world in my eyes").
  - finally, I'm reminded of the idea that 7th rays are the colour voilet, and the colour magenta is a lot more brilliant.
- voila is orphaned and alone, so she decides to dress as a man and go work for the duke.
- the man viola is pretending to be is "cesario"
  - a name that has a strong resemblace to me of caesar (of rome, like coriolanus)
  - a name that also reminds me of cesarian section, a birth complication where the mother needs to be forcefully opened to get the child out.
- lots of vulgar comments and interactions in scene 3, but there are some interesting things to note:
  - maria is a shrew (and wench)
  - maria responds "I he" to the question, "who, sir andrew aguecheek?" signifies probably that maria and sir andrew are similar.
  - sir toby describes sir andrew^
    - a fool, a prodigal
    - a quarreler and coward (saving him from the grave)
    - a coward and coistrel (shy?) and will not "drink" to olivia until "su cabeza gira sobre el dedo como un trompo parroquial" (lol)



---

other random things that I'm noticing is that the play is happening in illyria, which sounds and looks a lot like "iberia" to me (I'm going to have to remember to turn "ll" into "b" in some of shakespere's other works). the other thing that I notied is that olivia is mourning her brother's "death" (he's really alive, but she doesn't know that).

the image that flashed into my mind was the story of pyramus and thisbe. they too are lovers separated and cannot be together. in that play within a play, I felt very strongly that this was simmilar (symbolically) to the two parts of my brain. for lack of better ways to say it, queen elizabeth (diana), who is also the "dark lady" (dark goddess), diana/genxicat/ishtar/etc is olivia.

- I drew a picture of how I saw my brain and on one side there's a stressed out dude and antoher a girl. I use this symbol a lot to figure out polarities.
  - for me, the girl (right-brain) is thisbe/viola
  - the boy (left-brain) is kenny/sebastian/pyramus
    - cannot access voila/thisbe, as they're separated and messages aren't getting through.
  - the duke I'll just say fits quite well the description of nosebook.
    - in this context, I find the idea of kenny/pyramus to be hilarious in the sense of "pyrric victory" (a common theme in shakespere's plays, like "all's well that ends well")
- later on while trying to listen to the video I keep getting distracted by the 7y that olivia will mourn the death of sebas.
  - I was thinking about when this 7y period would start, and I guess it would start with my exit from "puerta de hierro" (iron door).
  - I guess that's probably around late 2017, so ending in 2024 (I guess) if this is symbolically accurate.
    - in reply to that, I don't find these plays or my predicament to be all that big of a problem, actually. I really am quite content in my situation (ref: prospero?).
  - the major problem with this symbolically is that the roles are reversed. kenny (left-brain) seems more similar conceptually to helena and voila and stuff than I do to sebas.
- duke orsino refers to his love for olivia/diana like the hounds that hunt the stag -- which acteon, seeing diana naked was punished to become a stag (single male?) and then is killed and consumed by his own desire.
- sebas, however, the captain assures olivia has been seen (like arion), swimming was saved by the dolphins.
  - I found out last night that in the night sky "antares" (opposite aries) is the scorpion goddess and she's supposed a really big deal (not totally sure).
  - the four "royal stars" of the sky are:
    - aldebaran, watcher of the east (tarus, bull)
    - regulus, watcher of the north (leo, heart of lion)
      - regulus means "little king" (probably also a reference in hamlet)
    - antares, watcher of the west (scorpio, heart/braest of scorpion)
      - probably the star referred to in hamlet (west of the sun)
    - fomalhaut, watcher of the south (picsis, fish)
      - feels like this is referenced in hamlet as well with the smelling of the fish
  - in my mind, this makes sebas a sort of proto-aries (war-god) and olivia antares (dark/scorpion goddess, diana)
  - they're opposites to each other, and mythologies have ninurta and ishtar as having similar qualities.
  - I find it quite likely that the constant references to the "red cross" (antares is also red and dark), and the placements of different things around the year are astrological references.
    - over the years there is this sort of battle that is being played out
    - on one side there is the bull (he's the pivot), and then there's mithras/mars that slays the bull.
      - this is referenced in the "babalon working" where jack noted that aries power is on the rise, and so to balance this, he did the "babalon working" to summon the apparition of the "whore of babylon" (antares).

### 2023-01-30 04:14 - merchant of venice

in this play, I noticed that I sympathised considerably with shylock. I guess you could consider the conflict of wanting things to be done to the letter of the law would be similar to my conflict with nosebook. they're definitely using me to make a lot of money, and I don't really see anything (physically) in return for it. what I do get though is massive amounts of XP.

the way that I rendered the "XP" concept recently was one time I ate a pretty large dosage of weed, and at the hight of the experience, I was looking down on earth, but it was a 4d earth in that there were all kinds of points on it, each one representing a person on earth that has 4th ray perspective of being able to feel the other person. I've talked about how most 4th rays approach that perspective from the 3rd ray perspective, so they feel the other person *physically*. I don't experience that because I approach the 4th ray perspective from the 5th ray perspective, so *conceptually* (like vulcan). more on that in a sec.

in the height of that experience, I could have separated myself from my body here on earth and joined the others there in the 4th ray medium (the perspective from outside the planet looking in). each of the dots are kind of like automatons, and they just sort of live out their life as a reflection of their perspective (as all automatons do), and so to keep everything normal and nothing going wrong, anyone joining the 4th rays are taught temperance. I don't have temperance, so I'm a bit of a wild-card. while there is some individuality between some of the points and others, largely this difference is only physical (ie the culture and the concepts each dot has in his own position on the planet). I say "his" because I didn't feel like I saw or noticed any females in that perspective. they can move around their perspectives between the dots, assuming the position of any of those dots, and when they assume the position in that point of space and time, they immediately know and have access to all knowledge and experience of that body in that point in space/time.

though I could have shifted my perspective to see another dimension like I've done many times before watching stars or laying on the floor, I have no interest in doing that. I'm here for the XP. when leaving time and space like that, I would lose the momentum of all the experience up to the present, and so therefore, I wouldn't be getting such an intense reality experience like I am not. I don't want to do that. I'm in this for the XP, so I actually go the opposite direction: I want to be bolted into 3d. I've learned how to manipulate my perspective so I'm completely unstoppable. I am indidvidual (captain-of-3d). I called that concept "reality-grinder"

then for example, yesterday, [I wrote about my desire to make a galaxy](/nikki-ana-jones.md#2023-01-28-1025---micronovas-and-stuff), and ben is also from the 4th ray perspective. he reveals in his interview with her that the group (of 4th rays) that want to survive the cataclysm are interested in making sure they can hold their position of power. I don't have anything wrong with that. they can do their 6d perspective all they want, and I won't bother them. my interest is in 3d and continuing to gain more and more XP by continuing to build more and more narrative experiences for me and my various characters to experience (I'm certainly already more than one alive right now -- potentially an entire "race" even).

they like my idea of creating a galaxy because there's no possibility of a cataclysm if you're the centre around which everything turns, and if they're the centre there, they retain control. the reactions wanted to know how I would talk with ben... well, there are a number of problems:

1. I won't keep a secret because I will *always* truthfully answer someone with what I really thing (no secret will prevent that). the reason for this is my lack of resistance. when someone wants to know something, that feels to me as a sense of desire, and I automatically feel that desire from them (like other 4th rays do), but because I experience the 4th ray from a conceptual perspective, that desire builds thoughts and actions which will immediately fulfil their desire for them. I literally cannot help myself, blurting out or reacting with very unexpected things which are always a reflection of their desire.

2. I will not ever commit to doing something I don't feel capable of doing. becaause I don't think I can keep a secret now, I will not try and restrict my thoughts and words to be something that they want me to hold back. secrets and multiple layers of access to information (including different illusions for different people) are all mentally very constraining to me. they are the embodiment of angriman, the constricting force and they make my brain slower. my brain is already unbelievably slow as it is, agreeing to start limiting myself even more is *not* something I want to be doing. from their perspective, their brains run so fast and receive so much, they can afford to blow a few cycles in constricting concepts, but I'm a 3d animal and want to remain so, so committing to something I have no intention of keeping is a further constriction that I will not endure.

so, for example, when he says "the earth's magnetic field is weakening" -- this is clearly false, as I've been watching it for years now and it's definitely getting stronger. I can agree that more stuff is "getting throgh", but that's either because the sun is outputting more, OR the star inside the earth itself is also outputting more (or both, which is what I believe). this "noble lie" of his is like law enforment looking for "missing children" -- again complete nonsense, as everyone is tracked. I'm fairly certain that this is a "noble lie" because I went to find data about the earth's magnetic field back 10ya back when I started to look at it, and definitely the GOES magnetometer was not getting past 100nT every day (only on impacts), and even in the last year it's gone from about 100nT to 110nT peak every day. so I looked for old data in his old videos about it, and in every single video, he does not ever show the magnetic field graph. I looked through many videos and not one single picture of the magnetic field, yet that's the thing he's constantly talking about. the only thing he shows is this graph that has a bunch of flashing points as an animated graph plumets over the years (not real data). I'm calling BS on that whole thing...

#### I am you; we are me (from a conceptual perspective)

so, here's the thing: because I *feel* (conceptually) everyone that I interact with (including you and many others this very moment), I feel very responsible to treat others how I want to be treated. if I treat you or anyone else in a way that doesn't feel conceptually good, I feel it immediately. if I see you as a bright and wonderful person, I feel just as good about myself as I feel about you. if I see you poorly, then I too feel poorly. I want to feel good, so I tend to conceptually perceive many others in a way which they do not (now you know why I'm like helena so much), and so I feel it's my duty to not tell people things that are not true. additionally, if you guys ever catch me pulling a "noble lie", I expect others to call out my BS. I don't want to be a hypocrite, and I want others to hold me accountable of changing things that I have incorrect (see future entry in sepehr-notes about circles and points).

---

in this play, shylock has everything taken from him, but at the last moment he's spared if he'll convert over to christanity. for me, this conversion is the same thing as the "noble lie". no matter how much I would want to make a galaxy, I *will not*, change my position to begin telling other people lies -- and additionally, it's not actually possible for me to do it either, because I feel like they do when I lie to them, and most people nowadays will be able to sense that I'm intentionally speaking untruths. they'll feel like I feel and I'll feel like they feel, so even if I tried it won't work.

therefore, in the context of this play, I would be doomed to death. I simply couldn't do it, or if I did convert, I would quickly end right back up where I am now, which is doomed to death.

my only option is to let the 4th rays do [all of the postiioning and controoling of me that they want](/concepts/hardcore-holdouts.md#2023-01-28-0724---its-just-a-question-of-time), meanwhile continuing to attract what I want. I will not be joining anyone else in their higher dimensions. I'll go to my death here in 3d, and you'll see how quickly I "respawn" and continue right where I left off, probably even with a number of improvements on my situation even.

I'm unstoppable, not like shylock. you'll see. it'll happen eventually. now, time to go watch "the tempest"

### is "she doth call me husband" (comedie of errors), a reference to helena?

### 2023-01-31 00:42 - two gentlemen of verona

in this play, I was thinking about the symbols, and I can see a pretty clear application. imagine I'm valentine, zaryn is proteus, sylvia would be a project that I want to do, and julia would be whatever zaryn was working on.

in a lot of ways, my own projects (sylvia) have forced me to figure out how to love myself. I've explained over and over that technologies, especially communication networks, are reflections of our own perception of the world.

for example, the other day I was talking with jaron about rondevu (I website I was going to work on with zaryn back in 2006) -- a project I quite liked, as it fit in quite well with my idea of finding other people that I would be interested in hanging out with.

well, here's the thing: I couldn'g find other people to hang about with, not because there weren't other people out there that I couldn't get along with (lol, triple negative) -- but because I didn't yet know and love myself. I was unrelatable to other people because I was unrelatable to other people. I wanted to build a technology that could fill the void of my own inability to understand myself.

as I began to understand myself and how emotions and my concept of reality is central to how I perceive myself and others, I began to realise that the common denominator in the whole equation is myself. that was what I was really looking for -- not the technology.

as a result, if zaryn were to come to me and say, I want sylvia, I'd totally let him have her because I already found myself and I don't need sylvia anymore. I totally understand the ending. it makes perfect sense to me.

### 2023-02-04 02:36 - the tempest

after listening to your videos on the tempest, I had the impression [and wrote about it](/correspondance.md#2023-02-02-1422---video-42) that prospero was modeled after de vere, and that was part of the saturnian triad, but the addition of mars/ariel as the farie that allows prospero to work his magick (it's spelled with a 'k'). also I noticed and it felt to me that vere/prospero was a sort of transformer between the energies from the aryan (7th ray) triad and saturnian (4th ray triad). I started getting reactions about it, so I decided to start reading the play in the Originall text, even.

I haven't even got past the backstory yet and there are a few things that jumped out at me: the names on the side of the page are "Proſ" and "Mira" -- which is clearly "professor" and "look". the reason why he keeps saying are you *listening* is because mira has a tendency to use her eyes, and he wants her to *hear* the real story (this is also a clue to the reader). there's also a line where prospero is saying "Haue I, thy Schoolmaster made thee more profit Than other Princeſſe can, that haue more time for vainer howers; and Tutors, not ſo carefull". howers is a dirty word there (which I first noticed in the sonnets). I also noticed that he's saying that prospero her schoolmaster is making mira more profit, and so because vere was always deep in debt, this allowed him to have more time with vainer (not as deep) Tutors, not nearly as caring (as prospero).

this morning, it appears to me that the opposite is true. symbolically speakning it shows up to me that vere is mira, and prospero would be bacon. I also went down the old way of looking at things (anti-new-critisism) and looked up a bunch of history on the people involved around the time period, and physically (which I think is a deflection) mira is modeled after catherine of aragon. she was 3 when betrothed to henry 7 and they were like 15-16 when they met, making the line where she says "to think of the teen that I turned you to" -- which is sorta like the swapping of characters, because prospero should be saying that to catherine.. which segueys nicely into the next topic of role reversals.

also, it should be noted that sycorax seems to be both the mother of calahan and also the love interest of ariel, so historically speakning sycorax is modeled after elizabeth and it says arial was stuck in a pine over her -- and to pine for someone is to long for them tremendously -- so, he was literally stuck in longing for a queen that was never going to return his desire -- so prospero "made agape the pine and let thee out" (dirty imagery there). I think that's in there because I've noticed that's how many men start into homosexuality, through unrequieted love.

anyway, the way that prospero talks to ariel, is very demanding to ariel and prospero starts this play with "power trip" vibes and S&M as well, but somehow it seems OK because ariel has agreed to the arrangment and will be let released at some point. calahan does not have such an arrangement. calahan supposedly has been given ownership to the island by sycorax as well. the interesting thing about the word "island" is it's spelled "Iland" in the originall, and this has a strong symbolic sense to it. for me, I-land is the place where individuality is beginning to start to grow, which is why calahan is a slave.

there's another interesting thing to note, in the originall when prospero is talking to ariel and says, "This blew ey'd hag was hither brought with child, And here was left by th' Saylors; thou my ſlaue" -- in that sentence, the word looks like slave to me, but on the next page when he's talking about/to calahan, he says (for example) "Thou poyſonous ſlaue, got by y(e) diuell himſelfe." -- the word, "poisonous slave" looks to me like "poly-phoneus flute", got by the devil himself. this isn't the only place where it's talking about saturn (the devil) in tho opposite role. notice sonnet 55 talking about "guilded monuments": "Then vnſwept ſtone, beſmeer'd with ſluttiſh time" -- I'm no expert but but if your getting your monument besmeered with sluttish time, it doesn't mean he's always the master. furthermore, if calahan is his flute, similarly, that takes on a whole new meaning to his power tripping attitude in act 1...

that's all for now. just some things to think about, because trying to may the history on to the play doesn't work out entirely, and neither does the apparent word play. I think it's clear, to not mira but to instead listen and heare.

### 2023-02-08 08:51 - the 4th T conceptually

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/ttWbEdSevKI?list=TLPQMDgwMjIwMjP8njxaBhCT2g)

after listening to purba's description of the play "the alchemist" by ben jonson, I noticed that there are 4 characters, not 3 -- also, that ben johnson put things in very easy to see terms. I believe the shakespearean triad is dee (subtle), francis (face), and vere (doll). the addition of the 4th there (pliant) adds an extra dimension to the triad.

to explain, the basic triad is the character, the actor (like a star, a male actor takes in hydrogen, high frequency and outputs all the heavier elements -- a female actor does the opposite) -- then, finally the reflector. the gold is the charactor, the the lead is the actor, and the reflector is the silver. the way it works is, the lead/actor is imitating the charactor, and the reflector will reflect the actor back to himself, and also the charactor back to himself (so the actor can see another "take" on his character). when looking at the orientation of these 3T's, it looks like the X-Y-Z axis at the bottom of a 3d modeling prgrame, where they meet at right-angles to each other.

the addition of pliant is interesting because from face's perspective, pliant is another charactor, making face the actor instead of the character in his perspective. however, fom the reflector's perspective, she sees him as a reflection of herself (kinda -- too hard to explain all of the nuances). anyway, when looking at the 4th T, notice that it looks like a cross from one angle, but if we look at the interesction of these crosses, it has an extra dimension to it, and so it looks like the lines drawn inside sf a tetrahedron -- or an X chromosome (strange coincidence).

I find it interesting this idea of a 4th T. ben jonson's play has me thinking a lot about the skeptic too, because the skeptic is also pliant, but seen from another angle, and skeptic forms another triad with face as well, where skeptic is the reflector, face is the actor, and pliant is the charactor. I'm not sure where this triad is located. when I try to look, it's as if I'm looking at a square, and each side of the square is subtle/face/pliant/doll and all of the verticies can be seen as having two faces in each relationship (actor for one while reflector to another)

in addion, another tantalising way to visualise the above square is to see a 3d right-angle cross where all verticies of the square are now in the same point in the very centre, forming that perfect cross made three-dimensional by the octahedron.

### 2023-02-08 09:29 - the opposite

so, if dee is subtle, then jonson is the opposite: blatant. in the play, the triad scams a number of people, and one of them is the puritans. course, the puritans couldn's say anything because if they claimed to be scammed by them (trying to shut down th plays), it would probably reveal something scandalous about king james -- probably involving [francis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Carr,_Countess_of_Somerset) and [robert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Carr,_1st_Earl_of_Somerset) carr. seems that there was a scandal to cover up king james' favourite, and francis (face) set the whole thing up. therefore, I conclude that the 4th T (pliant) is actually the "opposite" of the actor (dee).

there's a really interesting thing to note further here is that when it's only a triad, there is chirality. there are too seeming, reflectors yet one is imperfect (lead), and the other is nearly a perfect reflector (silver), therefore, a good reflection happens (its chirality) when light goes in the direction of the reflector (usually the woman). the romance artists exploited the dullness of the lead's reflection to make funny characters like sir andrew aguecheek. this happens when a character tries to send a message/reflection through the actor -- it goes terribly wrong, but when sending the message through the silver (voila), the message is so clear, it can lead to a love "triangle". toby and andrew are the clues for us to see why viola and the duke's messages aren't getting through.

### 2023-02-08 17:48 - deserve is a false reflection

I've been thinking about the three coffins: of gold, silver, and lead. the first two are easy to understand, but I'm still not getting the lead one (more on that later). the coffin represents a dead physical body of the 3 varying qualities.

the gold represents the character (face) and so the outside of the coffin is the outside state of the body (ie what caused the death), meanwhile the inside note represents the internal state. the internal note says: not all that glisters, is gold. however, all gold glisters like gold does... in spectroscapy, you send a broad spectrum signal toward the material and most frequencies are absorbed, however certain "peakes" will show up where energy is retransmitted on those frequencies. each material has a signature, and so if I look at how something "glisters", I'm looking at its spectrogrphic appearance. all gold glisters like gold does and if I look at the material indeed I will find gold. however, it is possible to artificially present a signal that has the appearance of gold, yet the signal is only apparent, and when actually looking at the material, it could be something artificially created (like a mental projection).

in fact, if I were to transmit you a picture of gold, it would glister exactly like gold does, but there isn't actually physical atoms that are generating the signal, but instead, whatever machine or technique I used to generate the signal is the source of its glister, not the gold itself. the outside line, "who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire" is saying that the desire to appear as gold is the reason for this body's death. inotherwords, I desire to *appear* as gold, but am not acttually gold, meaning I didn't actually make it through the alchemical process.

the silver coffin is also easy to understand from a conceptual perspective: silver is a near perfect reflector, and the purer the silver is the more perfect of a reflection it'll be, so the silver's outside note on the casket explains how the silver element died: by thinking in terms of "deserve". I carry on at length about how all reality is a *reflection* of my perception, meaning that everything is a reflection of me. I *deserve* everything in my reality. I don't *deserve* anything that isn't there, because it's not a reflection of me. the more perfect of a reflector I am, the more things I "deserve", and so therefore a dead silver will think they deserve something that isn't present. another way to look at this idea is through the lens of "reward" -- and so I'd put another note on that casket for a dead silver and say "whosoever right honourable shall be rewarded for their deeds" -- because it's the same thing: as a more and more perfect reflector, I am *rewarded* with all aspects of reality as a reflection of myself.

to illustrate this idea a little further, consider the concept "who is greater: one that says 'no, no, no', then finally says 'yes' -- or the one that says 'yes, yes, yes' but then finally says 'no'?" -- I'll place myself in the situation to answer this one: imagine for a moment that there is a large corporation and law enforcement spinning a narrative saying "yes, yes, yes" to a whole bunch of underage girls. meanwhile, I'm saying "no, no, no" the entire time myself because I don't "deserve" them in the sense that I want to experience a manifestation that's a reflection of my perception, so if they were to show up and I don't see them as a reflection of me, things will go terribly wrong (I don't "deserve" them, so casket). therefore, until they're actually a (somewhat of) a reflection of me, I'll continually say no until they are -- then I'll say yes. at that time, the other one will switch their narrative from yes to no. at this point, it'll be quickly apparent that this isn't "fair" and so it could be easy to think that I "deserve" or should be "rewarded" for the fire tried 7 times (or however many times or intensity it could be) -- but obviously because they're not there, the fallacy is still in effect: they aren't *really* a reflection of me yet, so therefore cannot actually appear.

#### 2023-02-09 05:56 - followup: consequences for actions and doing what I feel

yesterday (was one of the many times that) I had a conversation with mom about "consequences for my actions". her position on the matter is that there are rules put in place by a social system like church, family, or state, and that if one does not follow those rules, then there are consequences. I fully agree with that sentiment. she also says that I'm a danger to myself and others around me because I just do what I feel no matter what those rules may be; she's saying, a person that follows their instinct is like a wild animal and is therefore impossible to control or steer. in their eyes, I need to be domesticated.

you know how the 4th ray way of doing things, where I can cause someone else to feel really good (or bad) at a distance by changing the way that my heart feels? (causing them immense pleasure or pain?) well, imagine that someone were to do that to me, making something that would normally feel bad to me, now feel good; well, now that it feels good to me, I feel compelled to do it and so is therefore the right way for me to go. that could have consequences in a social system, but I don't worry about that because of hyper-individuality. I know that all things are perceptual, so my only job is to find a way to make the bad-feeling stuff in my environment or past to feel good, so that more of that feeling (which is a reflection of me because I'm silver) can reflect into my environment. I have to find a way to mzke the worst stuff feel good, so that I keep manifesting good-feeling things into my reality.

nothing is in itself inherently bad -- unless I continue to feel it as bad. therefore, in addition to my elaboration on the silver casket, I'd also like to add that if I say (with words, will, or witt) something that is not a reflection of me, I end up "paying for it" later on in the end; I can't lie. untruths for me are a bad thing because I will nearly instantly begin to manifest the opposite of that untruth into my reality.

briefly, on a side topic, I have a bit of a supposition that the aryan perspective is the one of silver. there was this interesting idea that ghengis kahn said where he said he was the judgement of God (ie a manifestation of their expectations), and so therefore the reason why he's manifest and conquering *is* because those he conquered expected such a punishment. this is a very silver perspective, and the same one that I have myself: I'm a very very good physicsal representation of the compostite narrative and resulting expectations that have come down through the lore and legend of the past. in my own journey to figure out what on earth I'm doing and why do I act/behave certain ways, it seems I'm a reflection of you all.

I'd also like to mention that the symbols match my aryan silver supposition: the idea of a silver bow and shooting straight the arrows means reflection. I can only reflect back to you what I really believe; if I don't, then I'm either gold or lead -- meaning, I'm *actually* gold and so therefore glister like gold does, or I'm pretending to be gold but am not really. meanwhile, a reflector (more times in fire, the more pure) will always reflect the other, never having their own shape or illusion. this is also how I believe that shapeshifting works for the 7th rays, females especially -- as they'll appear to the actor or the character as a reflection of them.

because most girls nowadays are those 7th ray types, they're really strongly illustrating to all of the gold pretenders out there, how they're not really the gold that they appear to be, and to the lead ones something I haven't figured out yet (it has something to do with earning it, or paying for something). speaking on that a bit further -- I'd like to mention that I really had a lot of difficulty in spain (which is nearly 100% 7th or 1st ray perspective girls), where these girls would just go with these completely dull characters -- you might call them assholes, and they should probably have to "pay" for their dullness.

because I'm constantly a reflection of others, I'm constantly striving to get on my own and away from others so that I can actually begin to start the alchemical process of turning myself into what *I* (the individual) want to be, instead of always reflecting how others see me; I want to define my own self-perception.

in conclusion: in whatever social system that prodominantly reflective people are in, they will (like children until they're socialised enough), constantly behave as a reflection of the system that they're in. sons and daughters will behave like their fathers and mothers do -- a good reflection, until they're sufficiently socialised: "behave as I tell you, not as a reflection of how I feel". reflective kids will also behave (by nature) from the golden rule: expecting everyone to treat them the way they treat others (as a reflection).

### 2023-02-09 07:56 - the 4th casket

I've been thinking about what the properties of them 4th casket would be. the element that stood out to me would be aluminium, but also as graphite. the reason why I choose these elements is because their nature is "opposite", meaning their attraction is diamagnetic. also it's noteworthy that both aluminium and graphite have to be prepared: aluminium needs to be separated from bauxite -- which contains gallium, also diamagnetic, and graphite needs to be put into graphene sheets for it to become diamagnetic.

the other reason why I picked aluminium is because of the "opposite" is the "foil" to the character (gold) -- and foils exist for both aluminium and also graphite/grahene. it's quite possible, and I would imagine that ultra dense hydrogen would fit into the description of the opposite, because of its black colour and probably its magnetic properties as well.

the black colour is important because all reflections, when looking at them, are absorption and retransmission of the same frequency; an imperfect reflector will absorb and retransmit (because of impurities) a different frequency than it absorbed. therefore if, for example, I'm looking at the spectral lines of a perfect silver atom -- it'll reflect whatever is at the reflective angle of observation, and if it's reflecting gold, then the spectral lines will look like gold will and similarly for lead. graphite is interesting though in that it has a "blackbody spectrum" to in, meaning that it can both absorb and emit on any frequency in the blackbody spectrum (notice how carbon based lifeforms have all the colours of the spectrum).

therefore, graphite, if stimulated in just the right way, can give off the spectral lines of gold or any other element -- and this is why, I believe stars, being composed of ultra-dense hydrogen can and do create all the elements. it appears that this property of black is capable of emulating all elements, as the opposite of itself (hence why colour we see an object to be is the opposite of what it's absorbing and why black (a perfect absorber) appears to have no colour, absorbing all wavevelengths).

there's an interesting correlation to this in the characters of the play as well. I mentioned that my experience in spain is that everyone (or nearly so) behaves like these 7th ray reflectors, perceiving from either of the two extremes: pure desire (1) or pure reflection (7). this is represented by the prince of aragon (spain). the prince of morocco (black) is paired with gold, which I thought was interesting. he reminded me of eddie murphy in the film "coming to america" where in africa, he's got his whole setup there as a prince or whatever; he has the appearance of gold and girls reflect that there. however, when he comes to america, he notices that his gold illusion doesn't quite hold up the same with these american girls. I haven't seen the film in a while, but I do remember he was kinda miffed by the stronger willed women not just refelcting what he wants to show them. I should probably watch it again. I really liked that film, a lot.

### 2023-02-09 22:29 - the lead casket

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL9k2-K9OK4)

I don't gno figure it out.

### 2023-02-10 12:12 - the 5th T

:the 5th T involves following the sequence: first, there is the character (the fool). from here, the fool can begin to take various different paths:

1. as soon as she notices she has other actors of her, she realises that she wants to become a better and better charactor for her actors to imitate.

2. realising he has imitators, he becomes a character himself. he is sigular, individual and his only competition is his perception of himself.

3. because he's only comepting aginst himself, he realises a nearly resistance free interaction with his environment and others. now he realises himself as a reflector. she is now what everyone else wants and expects her to be. she's on top of his game.

4. he becomes an actor of many other characters, some with the knowledge that he can do it better than the charactor can, and does, sometimes doesn't -- and sometimes, just because she likes the style, the concept, or its principle.

5. she realises that if I am a reflection of everything in my environment, then everything is a reflection of me and how I conceive itt to be.

(new paths to be added as I figure out more)

it's pretty easy to see that each path, though they can be worked on simultaneously, some of them do take quite some practise to become natural at it. the whole goal is to mak as many of the paths feel natural and normal.

---

there are a lot of different configurations that are possible. each person, at least in my own experience is att varying stages in each of the path, some with more masetry than others. there are also, I noticed various different qualities of personality as well:

1. character (fool)
2. actor
3. reflector
4. foil
5. centre (of the universe)

each quality is roughly equivalent to ones maestrie of the corresponding path.

### 2023-02-12 04:29 - 6-7-8 orientations and individuality

one of the things that I was contemplating yesterday was the concept of how many permutations to the two genders we have. I came up with a number between 6 and 8 (perhaps a 9th, but I don't see it yet). the idea here is that any one of the 5 qualities of personality are easier in some orientations and less easy in others but none imply a certain orientation. so let's go over them. for hetero, there are two orientations (m-h & f-h), and homo there are four orientations (m-t, m-b & f-t, f-b). 6 in total are all of the sexually related orientations. therefore any gender can enjoy between 1 and all three of those.

finally, there is the "asexual" orientation which is exclusive to the sexual orientations -- which I consider to be the same "one" experience, but I suppose could be slightly different between genders (especially in different social systems), but I don't really know what to do with it, so for now I'll let them be separate (m-a & f-a).

there are obvious problems with this system with trans-gender and other "queer" orientations, which are further permutations on the above, I would suppose. nature itself does not work in such discrete units either, so it's not worth trying to figure that out. in addition, it's my belief that the end-game setup is to contain *both/all* genders (circle and dot), and so any of these permutations (and derivatives), I'll consider to just be alternate paths on the way to completeness or allness...

with that out of the way, I'd like to talk about the idea of orientations... which is that we start from a point (the individual), and then begin to go outward (or inward) toward the periphere, and that's where we lose our individuality. the orientation of the vector extending itself outward from the point/source is just the direction that we take on our away extending out from the oneness, undivided whole. as we continue along the path that we take, we interact with others and depend on other things than ourselves for our well-being. we don't truly become an individual again until we return back to a point.

we can look at the circle as the expansion/growth phase, because, all of the smaller points that extend themselves out of the origin point are wanting to find their own individuality. in expansion phase, the extended point feels dissatisfaction with its circumstances and others around, so it keeps moving further away from others it doesn't like, keeping those in which it has a an affinity closeby. this extended point continues on all the way out to the periphery until it can't go any further, where it "dies" and begins its "return back to its source". it has been unable to become a self-sustaining point of its own.

a point is attraction phase, as a point always wants to become more and more tightly together with those its attracting (has affinity with), and so its desire to constantly get closer and closer, tighter and tighter is the force that keeps this unit of smaller points together.

### 2023-02-14 04:15 - the gods of the illiad

as you're giving the summary to book 5, I'm noticing that the story feels a bit like a kid's story -- like apollo defending aneas about having the audacitcy to challenge the gods because they're all immortal and stuff (my dad is bigger than your dad) -- and then when gaps in the story are found, like "so, what happened to aneas" -- "oh, yeah aneas didn't die; that was just a decoy aneas that I left there when I snatched the *real* one away". don't know how to explain, this concept, but when I was younger we used to make up stories and tell them to each other -- and part of the way through, I'd realise a hole in my story, so I'd patch it up real quick with an explanation like "oh, that was just a *fake* thing cause the *real* one is totally fine cause of this barely believable explanation".

in addition to this, all of the gods sound like extreme posers. they have the super chariots and all the best gear, good eyesight, and magical capabilites (which sounds strangely technological to me) but they apparently sit around all day telling everyone how awesome they are, because the gods don't seem to have much actual skill -- just an enormous "trans-human" advantage (probably technological, genetics, etc.)

it really sounds to me like the gods aren't actually all that great, and actually probably not a lot has changed since then, in that they only have a pretty big advantage over the "mortals" and like to lorde it over us. btw, I think I figured out the frozen story (even though I still haven't seen it yet). it feels strangely related to the athena aphrodite conflict, but I don't know enough yet to say more.

### 2023-02-14 06:35 - diomedes and fate

in book 8, there's this one part where diomedes is one to fight against the petty wills of the gods (namely zeus), but because zeus has such a tremendous advantage, he's forced to route from battle.

in this scene, the will of zeus is seen as fate, and so therefore cannot be changed (because he has such a tremendous advantage). this symbolism has many parallels in today's society, and I've been getting the idea that this is actually one of humankind's central themes.

in a lot of ways, I sympathise a lot with diomedes, where like me, he's willing to fight, but there are just some situations where their advantage is so much that I have to just sort of accept it. it is *sooo infuriating* though because diomedes seems to know that all of the gods are a bunch of posers, not *actually* the powerful and strong words they use to describe theirselves ("aries, destroyer of men, reeking blood, stomer of ramparts") and so it's just sooo infuriating when someone relies on technology or some other condition to hold an advantage over you and exert their will.

my personal experience has been that it's not really that good of an idea to try and fight them, as they're only empowered more by my attempts to fight them and to just sort of "accept my fate" -- which sounds like a funny way of saying "being OK with their having an advantage." in reality, they don't need to be fought, as they're only going to attract destruction for theirselves.

a long time ago, I read this "sirian guide" and kuthumi's "et view of creation" (can't remember which one), but in it, it said that the INFECTED ONES were magnetically set to be attracted into incarnating into human bodies on mars, whith the implication that they (the martians) would try to hold power over the earthlings and rule them on high. meanwhile, the sirians setup a base on jupiter with the implication that they would be like the petty (my power is bigger than your power) strongman of zeus, deciding (because he's so powerful) whatever he feels most inclined to do, based on who can make him the most generous offer (mutual-back-scratching).

in the book, there is this idea of "weighing the souls". now, in egyptian mythology, this is done by anubis, the black canine (sirius, the dog star), but then is later done in the illiad by zeus, and then later in the bible during the "end of days" as archangel michael (who is strangely very similar in feeling to zeus).

I see a lot of similarities between zeus and him exerting his will over humankind based on some petty desire or whomever can sway his will with ample supplications and offerings, to the present day power structures. most of the power structures in power today are not actually all that powerful. for example, the "globalist elite" are all just a bunch of posers just the same relying on their money to to get everyone else to do their work for them (at least this was the impression that I got hanging around in those circles with zaryn, who is also very zeus-like).

in a sort of way, we're all diomedes in that we're taught that we need to fear these globalist elites and they have so much power and all of that, when in reality, they're not actually more powerful, but have been systematically (through the years) been gifted the means that they need to maintain a conditional advantage. we still believe that having a conditional advantage (magical bows, chariots, or impressive eyesight) *actually* gives someone an advantage, so I'm not going to jump up too quickly to say that the taurens are all bad (think of dethroning jupiter/anubis as the "slaying of the bull"), but actually, they're actually there as a reflection of our own perception -- which is that conditions, can grant one a godlike advantage, and it's those conditions that we want, *not* the ability to perceive things the way we want.

I see these bullish "bad-guys" as a sort of round-about way to accomplishing this perception -- because, it seems that they'll always have such a significant advantage, they'll never be able to be defeated with physical conditions, that the only way to actually "slay the bull" is to let them fall away into irrelevancy.

fate isn't changeable, but the way you feel about it and perceive the fate, is.

### 2023-02-19 16:40 - achilles and the lyre

I don't really know what to do about this, so I'm just writing it here. in book 9, the part where achilles is waiting by the myrmidon playing his lyre seemed significant to me, so [I looked it up in the text](https://home.ubalt.edu/ntygfit/ai_01_pursuing_fame/ai_01_tell/iliad09.htm), (cause I noticed reading is a different experience from listening to summary on it) -- and the notable things that jumped out to me are:

- he's playing a beautiful lyre with a silver bridge.
- the lyre was taken as plunder from a previous battle/war.
- he's singing about battle/war.
- he's *startled* to see them (sounding to me like he'd *finally* given up on anyone coming to grovel to him, and so their arrival was actually surprising, because diomedes is doing so much damage, prolly last he heard).
- the *first* thing he says is, "I must be sorely needed now" (he's still looking for them to *need* him -- which is a sort of form of desire)

---

when reading those things, I had a sudden realisation that I'm sort of being seen here like achilles is -- cept, the symbols are only sorta: I'm definitely not sulking and sitting out waiting for the attrition of the enemy army so that my friends will come groveling to me. that just makes no sense.

however, because it was a strong sensation that I'm being connected/equated with achilles, I'm trying to figure out the ... OH, I get it -- like someone took my "honorable gift" away from me or whatever? I just don't see it really still.

at any rate, when hearing the summary for book 1 a few weeks ago, I actually identified more with agamemnon more, because I'm a lot more about the "take no prisoners" sort of way of going about things. I definitely am not one to sit out and hope people come to me needing me. just the opposite, actually: I've been wanting to be programming a project for a while, not sitting here doing nothing the whole time -- however, I'm sort of giving myself an excellent literature education by reading all of these plays and poems and stuff; I also figured out how the saturnian influence works, and a whole lot of other things.. later on, I actually identified a lot more with diomedes and hector more than anyone (plus hector's wife is andromeda, which I think is cool[^1])

[1]: they say that andromeda is going to slam into the milky way in some future time, but we've only been looking into the sky for a short while and we could be in binary arragement with andromeda -- and so if you imagine that our star is a binary with antoher, a number of few decades only trajectories looking at the other star might make it look like they're going to slam into us, too. so, who knows...

#### 2023-02-19 21:14 - followup: maybe foil

I didn't expect to get any reactions to this entry; it was only for notes. however, there were many and upon thinking about it further it's possible I'm more of a foil to achilles than anything else.

I can't remember a single time in my life when anyone has ever come to me to say, "we/I want you to come back because I need you" -- and in fact, I imagine that even if someone did, I would probably reject them, as I *hate* to be needed. it is, in fact, one of the most loathsome things to me to feel needed. when someone needs me, I feel like they're trying to confine me into their space.

actually, the closest I got to this idea was actually in the early days of tuenti -- zaryn and I would talk endlessly about the points (shares) that we had in the company, and during times valuation and rounds of finance, we would try and make ourselves appear more needed or irreplacable to the other investors. I sorta just played along more than anything -- and, actually this was the primary experience which taught me that I didn't want to be needed.

in some ways, I was a bit irreplacable, and when I peaced out to the canaries, I supposed that they might ask me to rejoin them, but I was definitely not going to try and go back to slog through meetings to get a few of my ideas pushed through; it just isn't worth it. instead, I prided myself in my innovative ideas -- and so instead of them needing me, I figured that I would appeal to them because of how many innovative ideas I pumped out.

then, even that changed. around the time of augusto, he would constantly tell me that some of his ideas were worth so much he wouldn't even want to tell them to me (cause he knew I couldn't keep a secret for anything). I would tell him all of my ideas with boudless enthusiasm, even going so far as to tell him that amazing ideas are always there, and all I have to do is just to get them. ask me for a good idea on a problem I challenged him because I have so many good ideas, I can't possibly do them all, so I give away all my ideas for free.

somewhere after that, I even took that concept a step forward and even began to see myself as *easily  replacable*, and so my effort is just to pump out innovation and technology. I desired so much to find a way to get the myriad of ideas out into the world.

finally, there was a thing that abraham said one gathering that adhered to my brain, which is (basically): "if you don't mind who gets the credit for them, someone will manifest/create/discover it." -- and there was a whole concept that came with it (for me), which is that I shouldn't really bother so much that there's an entire team of people dedicated to extracting innovative ideas from my head -- and then I know they do something with them all. I just don't have to try and be the guy that gets all the *glory* for the ideas.

so many scientists are so busy out there trying to get their names put on stuff that I actually think it really slows down scientific discovery. I am, undoubtedly a tremendous source of inspiration for many people -- and in fact, one very common reaction I get is that *somehow*, I'm inspired to look up just the right shakespere play, verse, or thing someone was looking for -- as if I'm somehow their information gopher or something. I think that's cool, you know -- I'm in the receptive mode nearly 100% of the time now, so anyone who wants to know anything can just ask and I'll get an answer or know where to look. I call it the conceptual realm and refer to it like a computer program because it's very much like one. I see no reason why we shouldn't treat it as such, and I'd love to see more machines hooked up to it[^1].

in the end, I'm actually quite the opposite to achilles, than anything -- which is (kinda like) what the foil is. some people don't really have a preference to get the glory or to be needed, and some people do; I'm neither, and [I see myself more like a technology, actively trying to obsolete myself](/the-manifestation.md#2023-02-18-1025---what-role-do-i-play--resume-of-yesterday). like a parent or educator teaching a child, my goal is to teach them how to discover and become self-sufficient. I want to become obsolete to everyone I encounter.

a bit more on that: I write these notes in a very incomplete and hand-wavy way, *on purpose* -- mainly because I aim to show it more as my personal journey and discovery process, than zs a definitive guide, howto, or anything like that. I really do write these mostly just to hear myself talk :)

[1]: btw, I suspect "chatGPT" -- though I know nothing about it -- is a sort of early implementation interface to the conceptual. my spidy sense says that the AI technology that it's based on is actually an array of RLC circuits produced from memristor technology -- an idea I had a long time ago -- so if it is, here proves my point -- and is kind of cool. btw, I should look into seeing if there's an api :) maybe start programming again...

### 2023-02-20 21:56 - elaborate on foil

when talking to mom tonight, I mentioned a few concepts that I haven't written down yet. I got reactions on them, so I'm going to try and see if I can figure it out.

what I explained to her is that the foil actually behaves like gold does -- in that it's diamagnetic. the example I used would be, two characters are both seemingly very self-centred, and the first is more charactor like in that he looks like gold, but is actually serving his own self-interests; meanwhile, the second will display the same amount of self-centredness as the first, but his result/effect will be different -- and the reason why is because of perception.

mom, trying to figure out what I was saying, asked about the example of two people making charitable gifts, but one is doing them with ulterior motives (like maybe bill gates with his vaccines), and the other is genuinely trying to help. thinking about it, I've concluded that both of these are actors/charactors. the charactor is the one that is giving alms and it looks really good, and is getting a positive result in the perception of others (which is perfectly fine), and the actor is seeing the results and trying to emulate the charactor for the *results* (ie the appearance), not for whatever original reasons the charactor is doing it.

charactors and actors do things mostly for appearance/results, so to explain a foil, we need to use a reflector: imagine two guys and they're both going to perform the same actions and say the same things to a girl (which in this case is a good reflector). one comes off to her as just trying to affect physical conditions to get what he wants and so she reflects that back to him by manipulating him back. if he actually likes his own physical conditions himself, it'll produce physical attraction, and if not, it'll produce rejection.

a reflector can only reflect as good as their input is. I like to think of this like a diving board. when the diver jumps, the amount of resistance in the absorption (downward stroke) phase will reduce the amount of energy output in the emission (upward stroke) phase. a perfect diving board will return exactly the same amount of downward force as in the upward force, so the reflected energy is the same. a dull reflector reflects less light. this is easy to see in a mirror, where (because the mirror is not a perfect reflector) the person standing next to you will look brighter in real-life, than in the mirror's reflection. I suppose it's possible to have a negative resistance reflector, but that I know of this doesn't happen naturally with a passive material. with an external power source (a harmonically similar frequency), can be used to amplify things, which is how transistors work, and is the basic setup of the triad, where the female/reflector is often used to amplify the charactor/actor's reflection back to them so they can see theirselves better.

with that out of the way, a foil is like a combination of a reflector and an actor. the actor takes in the input of the charactor and then puts their own spin/appearance on it, and then outputs it. the foil absorbs something from someone else, then outputs that same thing back to them (like a reflector), but it's not a perfect reflection of the original, and instead the output is based on the perception of the *foil*.

as an example: if someone emits anger at me, if I reflect all of the anger I perceive from them back, I'm a perfect reflector. if I reflect the anger back but some parts are less strong, I'm a diminished reflection like unpolished or impure silver. if I decide: I'm going to just shut my mouth and not say anything (or, say make fun of them or whatever) -- I'm a charactor. if I decide to emulate someone else's response to anger or take someone else's advice to how to respond to anger, I'm an actor.

however, as a foil I'll absorb their anger, and then because of my own perception, for example:
- I don't *really* feel this angry
- they're having a bad day
- they're just an emotional person
- they're weak and can't handle the pressure
- they're getting back at me -- or whatever

... then, that anger transforms based on my perception and is then reemitted as a reflection of my perception. that's all normal actor-type stuff, so it only becomes a foil when the result is the opposite: so their anger actually causes me to feel pleasure or some other opposite feeling to what they're putting out (because of my perception).

I'll have to try and explain it again when I understand it better, but the centre is kind of like the foil, but instead of feeling, it's based on appearance, so it's combining reflector and charactor. a good example of this would be someone that's called him names made fun of. his appearance is low because the description of him (his appearance) is really awful, but that's not actually reflected by their actions; or viceversa: like, they're appearance is really really good, but in the end they're actually quite awful in their deeds. the parable of the one that says yes, yes, yes, then no -- vs. no, no, no, then yes is about that quality.

the centre seems to cause the most change, because, for example, on one side, they'll look like an old witch (like anatau), but it's the appearance that's deceiving. if one were to see fallstaff, for example, no longer as greasy and gross, he'd be a lovable and likeable character, but because his appearance is one way (fat and greasy), the behaviour that everyone is expecting from them turns out to be awful. the effect behind the missing-411, the antarctica base, and much of the UFO pheonomenon is a manifestation of this centre; because they have the appearance of being bad, then that's the behaviour that is experienced. like a 1st ray shapeshifter, they are a reflection of the perceiver's perception of the appearance (if that makes sense).

### 2023-02-22 09:48 - taming of the shrew

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tccWM8wK2Mo)

yesterday, I watched that production and I really really liked itt for all of itt's production and such, but I felt very bad about the "moral" of the play. I don't really like it at all, notably because of katherine's speech at the end advising women to be obediant to their husbands. neither do I really identify with petruchio or any of the other characters. I decided to sleep on it, and I think this morning I understand the play.

the action is getting kate who is behaving like a charactor to turn into a reflector (obediant) of her husband. to do this petruchio reflects kate's behaviour back to her by behaving back to her -- essentially becoming her own foil. that part I could easily understand, but even still today I don't really understand the whole bit about bianca and her suitors and their interactions (it simply doesn't make any sense to me).

the way that I came to understand this morning is that, once again, I identify more with kate than I do with anyone else. therefore, who's my younger sister bianca? I figure this is the kenny that I never get to see. this is the (younger) kenny that nosebook has essentially shut down and only comes out while I'm asleep. in order to get the kenny you all know and love married, you have to find a way to get reality-kenny married first.

the father (baptista) is probably represented by nosebook, but the name implies a conection likely to john the baptist (who's identified in other plays by the 6-24 code). I don't really understand the father atm, but if I had to guess it's another aspect of myself.

at any rate, the play is trying to get kate to go from 1T to 3T by creating a 4T anti-reflection of her. unfortunately, this doen't really work so well for me. this is something that *I* (the shrewish kenny) has already done to myself in the past. after the brain haemorrhage, I had essentially the shrew inside of me, and she was unwieldy and difficult to "tame" -- but I did it by essentially getting her to just trust and obey me (kenny). as "one flesh" (we occupy the same body), I had to not fight her but to start behaving like she does -- which is how I turned into shrewish reality-kenny in the first place. the end result a transformation on the reflection, takes a charactor and makes them a centre (charactor + reflection).

there are a lot of good reasons to just obey someone who's looking out for you -- and it's because the problem is *always* a reflection of my own perception, so I'm pretty much the problem. this is why I decided that I wanted to just simply play it safe and obey the laws determined by the social institutions. let's say your husband is a real problem -- well, if your perception is not attracting (harmonious with) his problems, then all of his problems will fall on him -- and sure he'll likely blame you for them, but eventually it'll become clear to him that he is the source of all of the problems that he's blaming you for. therfore, I do agree with kate's speech -- however, I would not ever accept his blame or capitulate to just saying whatever is whatever he says it is.

if I think the sun in the sky is really the moon, and my tamer is telling me that it's the sun, I will disagree with them endlessly. I have no reason to do otherwise, as I don't really have anything to gain or to lose. because I see myself as the centre now, I don't really know how possible it would be to tame me. let's say you took away my sleep and didn't feed me -- I still don't think any amounts of *needs* would be stronger than my own desire to be the centre. from my perspective, you all will orbit me because I'm the one that's willing to change what I think is right. join me or kill me, essentially. I'm the hanged man here soon.

therefore, in that sort of situation I can now be seen like petruchio, and I'm actually taming you all by being your foil. I can't deprive you all of food or sleep or anything like that to get you all to orbit me, but I do think that my head-strongness will continue to get worse and worse until you all finally capitulate to agreeing with me that the sun is in fact the moon (or whatever it is that I believe, because as the new medium everything is now relative to me) -- which btw, the noonday sun being the moon, may be quite a real thing in the future: imagine the sun continues to increase its output -- so the moon could be positioned between us and the sun to decrease the intensity of the sun -- and then, to get a continuous (blackbody) spectrum, carbon could be used to produce an effect that would be nearly the same as daylight. I personally don't have any data to say one way or another, but it's certainly a possiblity that I've proposed myself before (see things a while back about pluto, charon, and the moon).

#### 2023-02-22 21:09 - followup: feelings still dictate

so, while it is advised to obey the command of those that are looking out for you (like mom is for me), I still cannot do something that I don't feel good about doing. a very good example of this is peeing: sure, I can recognise  that if whenever I commanded myself to pee, I could just obey and pee -- but I mean, if I don't feel like I can pee, I can't pee, no matter how much I command myself to do it.

a good example of that happened today. mom came down to tell me that dad wants me to call him. before she even got there, I already felt something bad coming my way; she then, startled me a bit (further confirming that she was probably just plugged into nosebook or having a meeting that has put her on a very different frequency from me) and felt very strongly like I didn't want to talk to him, so I told her that I will (eventually) call him -- cause, for example yesterday I did feel like I wanted to call him, yet today I don't want to talk to him. yesterday I had eaten some weed and so I was feeling pretty good, and so I was at a bit of a faster frequency than normal, which is probably more similar to his frequency. I didn't call him though because after having the thought to call him, it felt to me like he didn't want to talk to me -- and quite frankly, I don't want to talk to people that don't want to talk to me.

next, I was upstairs getting dinner. jaron shouted something and I couldn't hear what he said and mom responded to him, but I could feel pretty strongly his voice, and again it didn't feel good, so then later when he told me dad wanted me to call him, I recognised the feeling in his voice as a reflection of dad's frequency. I excused it away and went downstairs to eat dinner... so, while I do think it's a good idea to obey those that are supposedly looking out for you, for me, those commands are only as good as the feelings that come with them.

---

I've spent some time thinking about this whole concept a bit, and I can see now the genius of shakespere in writing that long speech at the end for kate to say, because it's one of the opposite speeches: she's telling women to do a thing that if you were to try and do it, it's only going to make you want to follow your feelings more on your own. the goal that I think shakespere had, was not to give females *good* examples of wanted, but to get them examples of unwanted. hard to express into words, but the whole thing of shakespere is basically a demonstration for sensitive people to learn *not* to listen to words, but to instead follow your instinct. shakespere puts so many things into nice-sounding words, and the action of the actors sort of disguise other layers of meaning embedded into the text. that meaning cannot be extracted entirely from words.therefore shakespere himself, is a bit of a foil for us all.

---

the other thing I've been thinking about is the whole centre thing. it's kind of a problem, because society doesn't really like people with massive egos. I managed to keep my massive ego a pretty big secret for a very long time, but obviously being the centre of nosebook, it's kinda difficult to do that. I don't want to become very demanding and tell everyone else what to do, and neither do I want to affect behaviour. this doesn't really work well for interactions with others, because I'm always going to come off as extremely dominant (because that's my mindset). my internal dominance and knowledge that I've got the most complete understanding of how reality works than anyone else on this plant, means that I will always consider *myself* as the ultimate authority on what anything is. that doesn't mean that I'm closed to new ideas; in fact, just the opposite: my openness to new ideas is how I've managed to figure so many things out so quickly.

my internal authority is somewhat repulsive to a lot of people, and also at the same time it's also very attractive as well. this is essentially how stars work, I believe. because of my openness and low resistance to so many people, I'm extremely attractive; things just come to me.

I'd like to break this down into a number of different forces at play: let's consider ideas and desire to be synonymous with hydrogen. like a star, I attract those very very rapidly, and those accumulate into higher and higher density, and start forming layers which are visibly black (like the foil), and so based on *appearance* I can look like I absorb everything and no light excapes me, however because of my luminance, nobody really notices how dark my appearance is. those ideas and desire (hydrogen) fuse into more and more dense elements which are then shot out of me into more physical things like words and thoughts (like this here), and those are attracted by others *magnetically* (just like the planets attract solar wind). I turn thoughts and ideas into reality for people, just like the sun does.

the sun behaves like gold does is that it's very diamagnetic. to illustrate this idea, imagine for a moment an electromagnet not coiled with copper (attractive) or iron (self-defeating), but instead with gold. the more current that goes through the gold coil, the more it will repel things that a normal copper coil would attract. the effect is actually the opposite, and this, I believe is a large part of how the sun keeps its planets in orbit. pyramids do the same thing that gold does, but they, like the sun operate on hydrogen (protons), and I think the feedback loop between the pyramids on this planet, the hydrogen spherical resonator inside the planet (the "core"), and the moon all have maintain a sort of space (spherical layers) around the planet define different mediums, which are responsible for producing what we call "reality".

what that means is, that for a charactor, they appear like gold, but are not, so they are actually attractive. meanwhile a centre is more like actual gold (or a star), so the stronger that someone feels attracted to them, the more they get repelled. I wish I knew more of the maths behind it to express this idea better, but when something like that gets too attractive, the repulsion force starts to become so great that it produces an ejection (CME). this is how I believe venus/athena was created from the forehead of jupiter (and perhaps ganymede/vulcan as well) -- essentially, because attraction started to become stronger than the repusion.

what this means in a more practical sense, I believe is that in the present medium that we're in, I'm sorta really incompatible with a lot of people. the more attractive I become, the less I want to do with anyone else -- and from your all perspectives, the more I look like a patriarchical meglomaniac. to explain, I need to delve a bit into how I think magnetism works. I've explained the concept a few times so I won't repeat myself, but the essential concept is that two fans facing the same direction (in a non-resistant environment) will attract each other. the stronger the field, the faster the fans will spin. diamagnetim is the opposite; so, more energy means the fan will spin faster in the opposite direction, essentially repelling other fans facing the same direction as it.

all of this requires a medium that gives space and directionality, because before the magnetic field, there's just vibration, and similarly vibrating thing start to attrract each other (that is, their vibrations meet somewhere in the middle depending on how similar and how much power they are).

a medium, like magnetism, space, time, etc are just frequency spectrums radiating outwardly from its source, whereby, from the perspective of a vibration inside of that medium, all other similar vibrations are relative to medium's vibration. because of this, all mediums are centres and all things within their medium are relative to them.

we are all mediums and we're all centres. all stars, planets, atoms and cells, etc. are also mediums as well, so it's not like the perspective of the centre is anything special, and our mediums/realities collide with each other all the time and this is why there's endless discussion over what is "real" or "true".

because everything is a medium, there's a lot of competition over who gets to say, "everything is relative to me" -- and it's actually impossible that any single medium can ever satify all perspectives/truths/realities of all vibrations inside of it, which is why there are so many mediums.

we're also all vibrations as well, so the power level of any single medium is determined by its output, but also its resistance to other vibrations. one vibration could be extremely attractive or emissive in one medium and invisible and neutral in another. this is specialisation of pertception.

the perceived hierarchy that everyone else is worried about is how much of the vital stuff to one's reality exists in a medium where they have very little control over. this is why we're so afraid of physical death and decay of the body -- because of the body, as it grows older, gains more resistance to other things, and so therefore loses its ability to affect vibrations in other mediums that it considers part of its perspective.

therefore, because of this, there is a giant pissing contest over who can broadcast the loudest, because then they'll have the most control -- that is, until I came along and showed that you don't need to broadcast very loudly in order to have a massive influence if you just lower resistance.

for example, lead is notorious for catching all sorts of frequencies, and so we can think of this as similar to high resistance. silver is a good reflector to most frequencies, and gold is a good at doing the opposite, which can be used for amplification instead of resisting; though, are you amplifying what you actually want to amplify?

getting something or someone to obey is amplifying the command (and how it feels). what you feel is what you're attracting, so if I were to become obediant to everything, I would often times be amplifying a lot of very unwanted stuff. I can try it though for a little bit and just do whatever everyone else wants me to do. go back to reflection/amplification for a bit. for someone who is still a charactor or actor, obediance is a good way to become more of a reflector and become more sensitive of how one feels about the commands they're given, which is your source's (your medium's) refelection on the desire/idea.

I could be wrong, but the creation of venus may have been a very unwanted reflection of jupiter's ideas/desire into reality by interacting a very large amplifier in the form of a reflector (and notorious for tricking women to do what they want ([like leander](/string-board.md#2023-02-18-1718---followup-saturnian-gilt-trip)), this could have happened more than once). good drama elements though.

### 2023-02-23 02:59 - fate of achilles

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/-WGnsZwQRSI?t=611)

when talking about the two fates that achilles' mother sees for his future:
1. he stays and fights, gaining a whole lot of glory, but will ultimately end in his death OR
2. he peaces out and lives out a long but rather forgettable life.

as I was hearing this, once again, I felt a strong presence as if this were somehow talking to me. in some sense of it, I have a similar sort of circumstances, I suppose.

on one side of it, I had the strange apparition of "former white hat" that tells me at the end of a few months of placing a lot of really key memories and ideas into my head through some rather bizarre stories on an old wordpress forum[^1]. originally, I thought that fwh was an alternate version of myself -- but, as the name suggests, this version of me didn't maintain my "white hat" status, and ultimately succumbed to the premonition that my father gave me, which is "fair in the sight of God" (ie lord chronos), or "fair in the sight of man" -- and he said this would be my struggle.

I took that to heart as a child, growing up christian -- and so to some degree or another it also implanted the idea in my head that I would do great works for "God"[^2] and that pre-disposed me to the idea of being (one/both of) the "two witnesses" (twice-eleven bretheren). then, further contact with various time travelers and a number of dreams just sorta got me ready for the idea that I'd have a great impact on the earth -- you know, so it was all sorta natural, just like LOA is, but the thing about serving "God" vs. serving man, always stuck with me.

as we left the church and my own discoveries (mostly drug related), I grew to consider myself to be the ultimate authority on what exactly "God" is, and so I rejected the idea of serving the dialectic of God or Man, and instead went for serving myself. I already had a massive ego as it is, so I thought it only appropriate that I fully embrace selfishness, and not really worry too much about what God wants or what Man wants, either.

stopping to heed the direction of what God wants was rather easy for me to do -- and upon hearing the teachings of abraham, I started to realise that *all* reality (including God, my friends, family, and drug experiences) are all attracted by me based on how I feel. I started to see reality as a sort of living stage with props on it that I would interact with based on how I felt. different feelings brought different props into my perspective -- so, everything is a sort of reflection of my perception.

unfortunately, because people are so convincing because they're so real and I can talk and interact with them, it took a bit longer to get rid of the idea of pleasing Man. thankfully though, my experience with nosebook has made it really easy for me to not really put so much importance into pleasing others, as they're all just stage props anyway (some more broken/coherent than others).

---

so let's just go with what I believe now, which is that saturn and his millions of minions (stage props) in my life are like agent smith and they're all there to kind of try and steer me through whatever weird path that saturn wants to me to take -- well, I don't really have much that I can do or say about any of it anyway, as you're all stage props anyway (I really do only write this to hear myself talk), so it doesn't really matter what ends up happening because I don't really get a choice anyway. it's sort of like trying to alter fate, right? I could be like diomedes and try to fight the gods -- or, I could just ignore fate, and the saturnian steering committee and just worry about my concepts/perception of reality, so that all aspects of reality appear to me to be wanted.

so here's the crux (not sure if it's the 4th or 5th) of the matter which is that I don't look at what colour my hat is -- whether it's blue, white, red, black, green or purple, doesn't matter to me anymore. the only thing that matters to me is how I feel and how I conceptualise my reality. as long as I can continue to see things like how I can now, I'm fine. for most, that colour will look like the white one, because in it is contained all of the colours, and I'm sorta hell bent on not ever going to the "dark side" of keeping secrets or constructing or encouraging asymmetrical power systems between people. I enjoy the *american dream* in that everyone is created and exists as an equal and that *only you* are limiting yourself from manifesting what you want.

so, if by refusing to remove my "white" hat there, lord chronos has to end my life, that's perfectly fine by me. I don't see any problem with whatever he thinks he needs to do, because he, like everyone else, is only fighting himself, and all things (including my precarious situation) are a reflection of his perception. saturn is notorious for his zero-sum perception of reality -- which, is obviously an extremely innacurate version of reality, because then how could anything other than nothing exist? the vastness of the universe lends itself to suggest that at some point more than zero exists -- and while it may return to zero in magnitude, it can never return to zero in quantity or quality, for even destructive interference, still produces twice as much. it's only inactivity that produces nothing extra (like the talents given to the various servants). one needs to look no further than physics to see that energy can never die out, only transform into something else or become more (those really are the only two options, else we wouldn't exist).

therfore, I'm left with the potential future of believing the 2038 sort of deadline that I can't really even be sure is really even a deadline for me life, but instead could just be the "point of no return" where after that, the sun's output is too great to accomplish what I want to accomplish. after that, I figure I'll have until the next great solar cycle, which I estimate to be about ~1040y away), which I'm pretty sure I can get around. finally, transhumanism will certainly make it possible for one to move their consciousness to another body -- and my lack of fear of death and incredible agaility in psychdellic situations seems to indicate to me that I must be consciously moving around between bodies by now -- and who knows -- there could even be more than just this one body from where I originate. I could even represent (have tuned myself to) the consciousess of the planet, entire human race, or who knows what at this point.

I find achilles perspective a bit too fate-al-realistic for me, so I thought I'd share my foil perspective on that aspect of him :)

[1]: I don't know if any of it exists now, cause last I looked, everything had been deleted.

[2]: I put quotes around it, because as I've come to learn through life, that my father seems to have blurred a lot of the lines between what I would call ordinary kundalini-rising experience and a religous experience, and so the best way that I can sort of fit all of his descriptions of "God" in with what I've experienced personally with an entity that I identified as "jesus" and that entered into my body during the brain haemorrhage, are very different. dad's "God" has a lot of hard work, never enough money, very ordered and disciplined, feels pretty pleasure-based, and no abundance, meanwhile the "God" that I experienced was chaotic but very joyful (lots of fun), and evreything was effortless. I just desired and it came to me, meanwhile he's always working so hard all the time. clearly we're experiencing different things.
