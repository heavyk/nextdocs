### 2022-12-09 18:07 - illiad books as destiny

imagine a primitive race of humans. you see them and you teach them to fight and drop the illiad into thier possession. these guys authorized a new phenomenal reality for them. I'm sure at the beginning it was horrific to everyone who got it ... then, with time, that just started to become the way of life (never-ending war).

right in the book, it tells them of how ugly war is, but they don't know that yet -- they have to figure it out, so they play out these new authorized realities. twisted narrators of the human past. you know, that's how compress time -- by making "worse" history toward the present utopia.

it's like you know how in hollywood where they either straight up invent a backstory (like in coon n friends) or really polish it up... well, imagine you did the opposite. instead of cleaning up the backstory, you tried to make it the most vile and derelict backstory ever. why does it always have to be clean? I think one of the objectivces of the shakespere project is trying to tell us forward in time -- it's OK to if horrible things have happened. he blurred the line between tragedy and comedy -- which is considerably different then rending your clothing throwing yourself on the ground and weeping. I think that's important.

the drama of the deaths is so overdone that I think this was put in on purpose to make them really fear death. if they knew they were mentally compareable to a tribe of chimpanzees, they don't have enough consciousness to begin to perceive from the universal perspective. in that stage, we were like insects or very primitive mammels. it's a sort of dream state because enki's conditions were so perfect and awesome. everyone felt like a million bucks, the gods felt like trillions or billions, much more than us, but still very good for us too. it was a picnic of slavery -- more closer to being pets and house attendants. right, so then after all of that falls down, these guys have been narrating complete nonsense to these poor extremely naieve humans, and in the end, you always see these stories showing up which are painting the gods in a certain light. these are the cover stories for them, but for us, they authorise reality until we start to authorise our own reality.

you can tell they were getting better and better at coming up with these symbolic stories, *in my opinion* much earlier on -- like the illiad and the oddessy; the stuff they pump out today is not nearly as meaningful and brilliant as the stuff today. what I think is that the medium is becoming less and less physical all the time, and even the way we converse is changing, so it's getting harder and harder to do realistic dialoge. imagine how they will have to tell stories when we no longer communicate as much in words.

what if our communication is visual? I personally don't like it. I kinda have it in my heart to make a *technological* system whereby emotions and and/or the body sensory chemicals we relate to emotions will be the transmission medium. I want it to be like these sort of zones where you share a communication space. this is especially awesome for concerts and DJs (cause you experience the vibe, music, etc. of that whole space). it's not visual, cept we'll use tablets and phones to power and control the devices. huh, you probably wouldn't want to lose it. I'll figure out a solution.

my intention is to do all of this *technologically* is because they are saying no to touching the astral, but they have zero claims on the frequencies higher than that in the conceptual. it's like an open internet there. call it the akashic records or the world id ideas, it doesn't matter. I want to connect to it technologically and allow others to do it too. all data sent and received will also be felt by you, and so it'll become natural, like I do to use my feeling to multitask a lot of things at once. none of them are visual, until we can connect it to a screen, that is. screens are going to be very very HD, so it'll be cool.

---

so, that went a completely different direction than I wanted to go. sometimes I have to stay on track. I just wanted to give the imagination of writing even more ridiculous epic poetry for a future human race. that'd be dope right? I think it's dope. I'd do it.
