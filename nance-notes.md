### 2022-12-09 18:07 - illiad books as destiny

imagine a primitive race of humans. you see them and you teach them to fight and drop the illiad into thier possession. these guys authorized a new phenomenal reality for them. I'm sure at the beginning it was horrific to everyone who got it ... then, with time, that just started to become the way of life (never-ending war).

right in the book, it tells them of how ugly war is, but they don't know that yet -- they have to figure it out, so they play out these new authorized realities. twisted narrators of the human past. you know, that's how compress time -- by making "worse" history toward the present utopia.

it's like you know how in hollywood where they either straight up invent a backstory (like in coon n friends) or really polish it up... well, imagine you did the opposite. instead of cleaning up the backstory, you tried to make it the most vile and derelict backstory ever. why does it always have to be clean? I think one of the objectivces of the shakespere project is trying to tell us forward in time -- it's OK to if horrible things have happened. he blurred the line between tragedy and comedy -- which is considerably different then rending your clothing throwing yourself on the ground and weeping. I think that's important.

the drama of the deaths is so overdone that I think this was put in on purpose to make them really fear death. if they knew they were mentally compareable to a tribe of chimpanzees, they don't have enough consciousness to begin to perceive from the universal perspective. in that stage, we were like insects or very primitive mammels. it's a sort of dream state because enki's conditions were so perfect and awesome. everyone felt like a million bucks, the gods felt like trillions or billions, much more than us, but still very good for us too. it was a picnic of slavery -- more closer to being pets and house attendants. right, so then after all of that falls down, these guys have been narrating complete nonsense to these poor extremely naieve humans, and in the end, you always see these stories showing up which are painting the gods in a certain light. these are the cover stories for them, but for us, they authorise reality until we start to authorise our own reality.

you can tell they were getting better and better at coming up with these symbolic stories, *in my opinion* much earlier on -- like the illiad and the oddessy; the stuff they pump out today is not nearly as meaningful and brilliant as the stuff today. what I think is that the medium is becoming less and less physical all the time, and even the way we converse is changing, so it's getting harder and harder to do realistic dialoge. imagine how they will have to tell stories when we no longer communicate as much in words.

what if our communication is visual? I personally don't like it. I kinda have it in my heart to make a *technological* system whereby emotions and and/or the body sensory chemicals we relate to emotions will be the transmission medium. I want it to be like these sort of zones where you share a communication space. this is especially awesome for concerts and DJs (cause you experience the vibe, music, etc. of that whole space). it's not visual, cept we'll use tablets and phones to power and control the devices. huh, you probably wouldn't want to lose it. I'll figure out a solution.

my intention is to do all of this *technologically* is because they are saying no to touching the astral, but they have zero claims on the frequencies higher than that in the conceptual. it's like an open internet there. call it the akashic records or the world id ideas, it doesn't matter. I want to connect to it technologically and allow others to do it too. all data sent and received will also be felt by you, and so it'll become natural, like I do to use my feeling to multitask a lot of things at once. none of them are visual, until we can connect it to a screen, that is. screens are going to be very very HD, so it'll be cool.

---

so, that went a completely different direction than I wanted to go. sometimes I have to stay on track. I just wanted to give the imagination of writing even more ridiculous epic poetry for a future human race. that'd be dope right? I think it's dope. I'd do it.

### 2022-12-09 19:13 - humans are like organisms when they start out

I tond to think of it like mycellium in a mudium/substrate. the organism reachs a stable equillibrium and then continues to grow or die (like mycellium). after enough perturbations in the organism consciousness begins to emerge, like a mushroom sprouting up -- it's like a head starts to form and then it grows to its hight. it's height is determined by some unknown process, and then when it hits that height, it sorta sprays out in some cases. others it's like an umbrella. you can think of the support structures that allow the vela to come out are determind by conceptual and emotional factors (that's my experience anyway), and so our conscious focus can actually change the shape of the mushroom (ref: penis envy). civilisations that begin to emerge in these heads of consciousness are still largely group think because they haven't developed enough mentation of their universe to do more -- and they definitely don't have the *I* am right perspective yet, still adhering to we (the organism) perspective.

---

therefore on their path to become conscious and more individual, it my belief that we learn through a narrative structure. the humans, being naieve, still thinking the gods are so great are willing to try anything. so, awful things get happened depending on how you're tuning the species.

I noticed tonight that the more war there is, the less the individuals of the species want to be right -- because wars (illiad) and petty arguments (shakespere's works) have been great reality authorship to guide our interactions with each other, we must look to see how that effects the resulting *individual*. so, it looks like: the more pointless wars, bloodshed, and domestic disputes that a race can have, the less of a desire to be right the individual will have. what that means is, it will take a monumental set of circumstances to break from the group and become an individual in his rightness.

therefore, I wonder how far this could be taken. like, what if there was a massive race that had billions and billions of years of no need to be right about things, followed by lots and lots of bloodshed, nobody ever will think to be right. it'll be like a beehive. who in the world would ever have the preposterous idea to decide "no, I'm right" in *that* culture? well, probably me.
