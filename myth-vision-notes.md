# myth-vision notes


JtB and jesus are the same age
events happened in 50's, but got moved some years back because later on another one jesus ben pantera will symbolically accomplish the same thing
if jesus is paul, that's more problematic than if jesus is the egyptian

antipas (JA 18 116-119) killed john the drencher because of his powerful oratory (influence), he was seen as a threat: john was sent to macharus (a fortress in paraea where the daughter of aretas IV was hiding out); john was killed there.

- make things as dfficult as possible (1000ad)
- ben pantera and egypt scene (1000ce)
- john the drencher dies in 28-30 (during calm)
- the egyptian shows up 50's and fires up the rebels/robbers
  - lights a samaritan village on fire, etc.
  - gets 400 dudes killed on mt. olives, etc.
- the egyptian escapes
- later the egyptian (saul) resurfaces as paul
  - saul means "asked for"
  - paul comes from heb verb "to be extraordinary"
  - paul comes from greek verb "to stop/halt/pause"
  - paul in latin means "humble", "little", or "small"
  - this name tells me of a sort of "failure" to be what was asked for

### paul notes

crazy theory: following my timeline there with lena, what we have is the following events:
- john the drencher announces that someone coming after him is greater than he.
- jesus ministers in the 30's (in vega) and is crucified in vega as well. therefore, only the people with astral vision can see this event
- the egyptian shows up in the 50's and starts causing a whole bunch of problems, but essentially replaying the same symbols as vegas jesus and also panthara jesus (to synchronise the timelines)
- the egyptian escapes the crucifixion (and perhaps later converts to become paul -- not sure if they're different; doesn't affect the hypothesis)
- paul is essentially a concept projecting down into physical space, so he'll always appear (like in a dream) as the person will translate that concept (so, like if they think wise people are old, he'll look old, etc) -- a shapeshifter -- changing not only appearance/continance but also interactions and perception regarding the idea (for an example of this, pay attention to how differently I respond in differing physical circumstances: my audience, if I'm writing vs talking, etc. -- cause all of those things influence heavily the way that the same concept gets rendered into the medium)
- paul begins his ministry but nobody believes him because nobody actually saw said crucifixion (cept the ones with astral perception -- which was only the elite romans at that time)
- paul begins spreading the message, basically through gay sex (the golden ass?), and he's opening up their eyes to be able to have this sort of spiritual vision and body. it seems to me there's a constant emphasis keeping "the vessel" pure, which seems to me to relate to not having sex with women.
- put it all together, and what I think happened is that this "resurrection" *did* occur, and it basically moved all of the astral guys over to vega. earth obviously continued on -- and the destruction that happened since then did cause the dark ages on earth (but not in vega).
- in ~1050 panthera guy shows up and performs the same set of symbols, thereby linking the timelines.

- "the announcement/evangelion" is the word "evangelion" is the same word that hermes uses for the messages of zeus. lots of zeus and mercury imagery in there.
- 1 corin 4:15 - you might have any number of tutors in christ, but not many fathers. for, in christ jesus, I -- through the announcement -- brought you into being
- paul keeps adjusting what he's saying, changing it as he comes under pressure for the things he's saying not coming to pass -- and though it may appear that he's changing what he says, to me, it looks like he's trying to explain in more levels of code:
  - no, not a *literal* resurrection, but a *spiritual resurrection* -- where if you're flesh and blood, you won't be taken to heaven/vega...
- it's also worthy to note the similarities between the different characters in this reconstruction narrative:
    - pantera: ishtar/aphrodite (earth-bound 7th ray) (shapeshifting body/image that provides a physical body)
    - paul: vulcan, creating the thunderbolts for zeus (conceptual 5th ray -- incarnated perhaps into a physical body)
    - the egyptian: mars/thoth (the 7th ray warrior/magician)
    - ben pantera:

- gal 2:5 - we did not yield in submission to them [false brothers who would 'enslave' us] for a moment, so that the truth of *the announcement* could continue for you [non-judeans]
- phil 3:21 - they're trying to get you involved in a political community here on earth, but our political community is in heaven/vega; and from there we're waiting for a saviour that will evacuate us
- acts 17:
  - certain lewd fellows of the baser sort ... assulted the house of jason ... crying these that have *turned the world upside down* ...
    - jason and the argonauts?
    - (I believe vega is upside down -- and there seems to be a connection to left-handers too)
  - ... whom jason hath received ... who do contrary to the decrees of cesar, saying *there is another king jesus*
    - (I believe that because these solar systems are connected, we exist in both places, but one can only access the conceptual aspect/archon of oneself through the astral)
  - ... and when they had found jasons and the others sufficient, they relieved them ...
