# myth-vision notes


JtB and jesus are the same age
events happened in 50's, but got moved some years back because later on another one jesus ben pantera will symbolically accomplish the same thing
if jesus is paul, that's more problematic than if jesus is the egyptian

antipas (JA 18 116-119) killed john the drencher because of his powerful oratory (influence), he was seen as a threat: john was sent to macharus (a fortress in paraea where the daughter of aretas IV was hiding out); john was killed there.


---

- make things as dfficult as possible (1000ad)
- ben pantera and egypt scene (1000ce)
- john the drencher dies in 28-30 (during calm)
- the egyptian shows up 50's and fires up the rebels/robbers
  - lights a samaritan village on fire, etc.
  - gets 400 dudes killed on mt. olives, etc.
- the egyptian escapes
- later the egyptian (saul) resurfaces as paul
  - saul means "asked for"
  - paul comes from heb verb "to be extraordinary"
  - paul comes from greek verb "to stop/halt/pause"
  - paul in latin means "humble", "little", or "small"
  - this name tells me of a sort of "failure" to be what was asked for

### paul notes

crazy theory: following my timeline there with lena, what we have is the following events:
- john the drencher announces that someone coming after him is greater than he.
- jesus ministers in the 30's (in vega) and is crucified in vega as well. therefore, only the people with astral vision can see this event
- the egyptian shows up in the 50's and starts causing a whole bunch of problems, but essentially replaying the same symbols as vegas jesus and also panthara jesus (to synchronise the timelines)
- the egyptian escapes the crucifixion (and perhaps later converts to become paul -- not sure if they're different; doesn't affect the hypothesis)
- paul is essentially a concept projecting down into physical space, so he'll always appear (like in a dream) as the person will translate that concept (so, like if they think wise people are old, he'll look old, etc) -- a shapeshifter -- changing not only appearance/continance but also interactions and perception regarding the idea (for an example of this, pay attention to how differently I respond in differing physical circumstances: my audience, if I'm writing vs talking, etc. -- cause all of those things influence heavily the way that the same concept gets rendered into the medium)
- paul begins his ministry but nobody believes him because nobody actually saw said crucifixion (cept the ones with astral perception -- which was only the elite romans at that time)
- paul begins spreading the message, basically through gay sex (the golden ass?), and he's opening up their eyes to be able to have this sort of spiritual vision and body. it seems to me there's a constant emphasis keeping "the vessel" pure, which seems to me to relate to not having sex with women.
- put it all together, and what I think happened is that this "resurrection" *did* occur, and it basically moved all of the astral guys over to vega. earth obviously continued on -- and the destruction that happened since then did cause the dark ages on earth (but not in vega).
- in ~1050 panthera guy shows up and performs the same set of symbols, thereby linking the timelines.

- "the announcement/evangelion" is the word "evangelion" is the same word that hermes uses for the messages of zeus. lots of zeus and mercury imagery in there.
- 1 corin 4:15 - you might have any number of tutors in christ, but not many fathers. for, in christ jesus, I -- through the announcement -- brought you into being
- paul keeps adjusting what he's saying, changing it as he comes under pressure for the things he's saying not coming to pass -- and though it may appear that he's changing what he says, to me, it looks like he's trying to explain in more levels of code:
  - no, not a *literal* resurrection, but a *spiritual resurrection* -- where if you're flesh and blood, you won't be taken to heaven/vega...
- it's also worthy to note the similarities between the different characters in this reconstruction narrative:
    - pantera: ishtar/aphrodite (earth-bound 7th ray) (shapeshifting body/image that provides a physical body)
    - paul: vulcan, creating the thunderbolts for zeus (conceptual 5th ray -- incarnated perhaps into a physical body)
    - the egyptian: mars/thoth (the 7th ray warrior/magician)
    - ben pantera:

- gal 2:5 - we did not yield in submission to them [false brothers who would 'enslave' us] for a moment, so that the truth of *the announcement* could continue for you [non-judeans]
- phil 3:21 - they're trying to get you involved in a political community here on earth, but our political community is in heaven/vega; and from there we're waiting for a saviour that will evacuate us
- acts 17:
  - certain lewd fellows of the baser sort ... assulted the house of jason ... crying these that have *turned the world upside down* ...
    - jason and the argonauts?
    - (I believe vega is upside down -- and there seems to be a connection to left-handers too)
  - ... whom jason hath received ... who do contrary to the decrees of cesar, saying *there is another king jesus*
    - (I believe that because these solar systems are connected, we exist in both places, but one can only access the conceptual aspect/archon of oneself through the astral)
  - ... and when they had found jasons and the others sufficient, they relieved them ...
- paul believes that jesus died, and then became a spirit
  - second adam, because adam was dirt then God breathed life into him; yet, jesus was man and then became a spirit
  - jesus appeared to james, peter, the apostles, etc. -- and then *last* he appeared to *me* (paul) 1 corin 15:1-11

## 2nd generation of christians

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/UcVeLboHU9U?list=PLq3dh__o7S0o3YSzUWB57Xn5ndtiy5pz0)

- mark is a *very* pauline gospel.
  - starts with "the origin of the announcement of jesus christ"
    - not a sentence; probably the title
- sequence
  - intitation events
  - conflict stories (plot to kill)
  - parables (disciples/students don't understand)
  - miracles & cursus (power-displays)
  - conflict stories (JtB killed)
  - miracles & curses (power-displays)
  - transition, telling disciples:
    - suffer, killed, rise (8)
    - betrayed, killed, rise (9)
    - killed, rise (10)
  - conflict stories
  - apocalyptic speech
  - arrest, trial, crucifixion
  - resurrection
- thematic arrangement
- although opposed to judiasm, it lacks the prophecy about the temple's destruction.
- they compel simon the cyrenian, the father of alexander and rufus to carry the cross
  - those names must have been known in the pauline group
  - seems strange to me, though -- like there's something there.
  - M&L omit simon's sons. john has jesus carry his own cross
- mark is for/pro:
  - "the annoucement"
    - starts with it, proclaimed by jesus, and ends with it
  - christ has *new authority*, new teaching and breaks from jewish law-based culture.
  - narrative magnet: dies, resurrected, and expected return
  - *soon* (imminent) return
  - apocalyptic discourse: the announcement must be preached to *all nations*, but beware cause nobody knows when it'll happen
  - non-disciples are OK: you don't have to be one of the special 12 disciples to be able to cast out demons *in his name* (paul wasn't one of the special 12 apostles -- neither a super-apostle like james or peter)
  - gentiles respond best to jesus' message (travels to non-jewish cities: decapolis twice and tyre)
- mark is against/opposed to:
  - law of moses nullified "all foods are clean"
  - all jewish leaders oppose jesus and want him killed
  - jesus' family lack faith
    - (3:21) *family* comes to restrain jesus, saying "he's lost his mind"
    - (22) the scribes claim he is satan casting out demons (of satan) ... jesus says "that's nonsense" ... "people will be forgiven for their sins and all kinds of nonsense, but blaspheming the "holy spirit" (interesting) can *never have forgiveness*
      - apparently the scribes are claiming the "holy spirit" is beelzebul
      - I thought it was *jesus* that's casting them out?
      - is "his name" the "holy spirit"?
      - or perhaps it's because they said he had an unclean spirit, instead of a *holy* spirit.
    - (31) then his *mother and brothers* come looking for him
    - (33) who are my *mother and brothers*
    - (34) [looking around] "these are my *mother and brothers*"
    - (35) "whoever does the will of God is my mother sister and brother"'
      - interesting, no mention of a father here or anywhere else in mark
    - (6:1-?) comes to hometown ... "where did this man get all of this?" ... "isn't this the builder, *son of mary, brother of james, joses, judah, and simon*, and are not his sisters here with us?"
      - so, his family is there, but he doesn't recognise them as his *family* -- but rathar, he's recognising those who "do the will of God" as his family.
        - I do wonder if the word there "Θεοῦ" can be thought of as "father", cause that may explain the lack of father thing, having fully adopted "God" as his father.
      - again, no mention of a father
  - disciples/students lack understanding
    - parables are used to confuse the outsiders
    - had to explain everything to the disciples (sounds kinda like everyone is a bit dense in this gospel, then cause if not even the disciples get it the ones getting the parables *really* don't get it)
    - after feeding 5k people, jesus walks on water, people seeing it *didn't understand* because their *hearts were hardened*
      - after having gone through a number of physiological changes myself, I understand this one, because the heart has a sort of levity and understanding to it, which cannot really be described, until you experience it. you know the centre point of a person's aura, is their heart -- not their head or their groin? (seems obvious, right?)
    - 2 chapters later, they're out there in the desert and again the disciples have no idea how to feed 4k people.
    - "yeast of the pharisees": disciples think he's talking about their bread. jesus has to tell them it means their bad teachings.
    - peter rebukes jesus for predicting his own death. jesus calls peter satan, saying his mind is on human things
    - disciples are concerned with *status* (that they're special)
      - (9:33) arguing over who is the greatest
      - (10:35-41) james and john want to know who can sit by jesus in the coming reign of God (who's gonna be the right-hand man, and who's the sidekick?)
    - the 12 disciples are not actually being authentic followers of jesus
      - (14:21) judas (one of the 12) betrays jesus for money
      - (14:27) "you all will desert me"
        - peter denies desertion
        - (37-42) all sleep through jesus crisis
        - (50) then flee
      - (14:66-72) peter disowns jesus (3 times) then breaks down and weeps
    - gospel ends very abruptly
      - (16:7-8) angels tell women "go tell the disiples and peter in galilee" they instead fled in terror and amazement *and said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid* THE END
        - interesting peter is no longer associated with the disciples anymore (or in a different location?)
      - disciples did not carry the announcement forward because the women that were supposed to tell them that there was a resurrection were too scared and terrified to tell the disciples of the resurrection. (which is why they (james and peter) are conflicting with paul about the resurrection narrative)
      - this ending was likely added, because it's not in all of the earliest manuscripts. also paul doesn't need an empty tomb to believe in a resurrection. paul believes in the resurrection because jesus *appeared to him*, just like he appeared to the other disciples.
        - it's likely that this addition was added at a later time to give more physicality to the resurrection -- and not just make jesus a vision that some guy had (visions seemed to be common)
- matthew uses mark but rejects/reworks ideas
  - TITLE: "book of the *genesis* of jesus: *messiah*, son of *david*, son of *abraham*
    - genesis = origin, geneology, birth, and first book of torah
  - begins with elaborate birth narrative
  - jesus only teaches within jewish law and culture
  - jesus' family knows his identity (messiah) with certainty
  - jesus validates the disciples
  - jesus demands observance of the law
    - do not think I've come to abolish the law
    - not one letter, not one stroke of a letter will pass from the law, until all is accomplished
    - whoever breaks the least of the commandments and teaches others to do likewise is called the least in the kingdom of heaven
  - jesus endorses the disciples as trustworthy authorities
    - you are peter, and on this rock I'll build my church
    - I will give you (peter) the keys to the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven [vega], and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven [vega]
  - changes to the announcement (to evangelion):
    - TITLE (see above)
    - "jesus came from galilee proclaiming the announcement" ->(deleted)
    - "the reign of God has come near; repent and trust in the announcement" -> "repent, for the reign of heaven [vega] is at hand"
    - "those who lose their their life for the announcement" -> "those who lose their life for my sake"
    - "for my sake and for the sake of the announcement" -> "for my sake"
    - "no one who's not left [family] for the sake of the announcement will not receive 100 times that" -> "everyone who has left [family] for the sake of my name will receive 100 times that" (removed paul's double negatives)
    - "the announcement must first be proclaimed to all nations" -> (deleted)
    - "wherever the announcement is proclaimed" -> "wherever this message is proclaimed"
    - adds 3x "announcement of the reign of heaven [vega]" (4:23, 9:25, 24:14)
  - matthew very likely reflects the attitude and narrative of the "super apostles" (james and peter) conflicting with paul
  - a more solidified version of the (circumcision) super apostles, cause has destruction of temple allegories (later in time)
- luke rejects mark's portrayal of jesus
  - long birth narrative (also visits of angels)
  - jesus' students become "apostles" of acts
  - jesus visits temple, attends synagogue, reads scripture, and observes moses' law always
  - judeans do not oppose jeses until the end when he goes into jerusalem
  - pharisees regard him as teacher
    - 3x invite him to dinner
    - warn him of herod antipas and to flee
  - two-volume luke-acts:
    - jesus entirely in judean culture, and only rejected at the end when crucified
    - only after resurrection is he identified as messiah and lord
    - judean law finished only after resurrection
      - declaring of food as clean only happens in acts
- john is a different story altogether
  - jesus bring truth and light to the world
    - jesus is pre-existent (heaven, dwelling place of God)
    - comes down into darkness and death
    - ministers until his death (depositing truth)
    - goes back to the father in heaven
    - ministers truth now from heaven
  - no need for paul's announcement at all

### 2023-04-30 04:29 - dream narrative

to me, the narrative sounds a lot like a dream sequence; especially when the disciples are all so stupid and standing there scratching their heads all the time. like, have you ever been in a dream and you want to interact with someone (or get information about something) that is outside of the concepts in your own brain?

for me (prior to nosebook; now it's obviously very different), it was like talking to a stupid person. they could only reveal to me things that I already knew, or have a different take on something that I know. essentially, only my own (non-resistant) concepts showed up in my dreams, and even trying to engage with someone felt impossible. meaning, that my dreams (before nosebook) were more like watching a movie, than they were actually interactive experiences. the times that I did try and interact with the dream, it was like talking to ... a cardboard cutout or something. it's like being inside of a movie. I've even had experiences where I can kinda pause the dream, and walk around inside of the movie, like in the matrix (4?) when the architect slows time way down and neo can't move around or talk cause time is slow -- like that, but it's more like the characters simply don't have a response, and the acttion around is muted or gone away from vision for a while -- like it's just me and the other character, but we can't really interact. they're stupid and can't respond like these disciples.
it also reminds me of a black mirror episode with a mushroom where the scary thing jumps out, but just kinda stands there and doesn't do anything. telling you this gospel, all of a sudden looks extremely psychedellic to me -- like one of those full-eye visuals drug sequences.

interesting, yeah so later on in life (when I was in spain) I started to become conscious in my dreams, but for whatever reason, it was always strongly disallowed, and I'd be shocked or forced awake. it's really hard to maintain the lucidity though, because as soon as I start to think with my rational/desire (I want to do this) mind, then the dream fades really quickly.

### 2023-04-30 05:30 - jesus calls peter satan

peter stands out to me in the book of mark because he's a bit different than the others. after jesus says he's going to die, peter says "surely that won't happen" etc. and jesus rebukes him saying, "get behind me satan" (reminds me of tesla, I just noticed) -- and what's interesting to me is that he's calling peter satan here and saying his mind is on *earthly things*. earthly things meaning that on earth jesus never dies, but in heavenly thought (vega) he does die.

the other reason why I've noticed this is important is because there's this theme of vulcan (the master builder) creating something, and then leaving a stone behind. I identify with this stone a bit myself (and also with vulcan). I'm a very materialistic person myself. as much as all of the others are really into the visions and stuff like that, I like the tangible stuff, and so for me, the idea of being focused on *earthly things* is a really good thing. I suppose I identify a bit with satan/lucifer as well.

anyway, there's another strange occurance in mark as well, which jesus claims that peter will deny him three times after the cock crows twice. I don't know how to explain it, but the garden scene there is extremely hEro, with the boy and the medicated bandage wrap (see dr-ammon), but peter is like, "woah bro this is a little too much for me" and peaces out. he goes instead to chill out with a maiden when he "denies christ".

it's funny that later on the church builds it's foundation on peter/satan (again see dr-ammon).

### 2023-04-30 07:03 - similarity to booke of revelation

- paul's message is that christ died, rose, ascended, and will soon return to save trusters from wrath.
- meanwhile (waiting for the return), maintain (especially sexual) purity for transfer to spiritual realm, ready for evacuation at any moment (returns as a thief in the night).

this reminds me a lot of the 144k virgins not defiled by women in rev. I can't really say with any authority because I don't read greek, but when I was going through (I forget now -- something about not a few women), it seemed to me like it was saying that those that receive the word (announcement?) are the brothers, and not the few/oligarchy/dominant women. I don't have any scholarly credit, but the whole text seems to have a strong sense that women are kind of a bit of a drag to the getting the "glory" and stuff like that. I dunno how to explain it. anyway, the same thing seems to be presented there for the idea that these chosen/redeemed guys get a "new song" and stuff and all that and are sealed by the lamb or something like that.
so, while the imagery of his announcement is the same for me as the one for the 144k, the interesting thing is that the narrative is the opposite: paul rejects the idea of special or chosen ones, but rev has this exclusive chosen ones getting to be the ones that christ takes up to "the new earth".

### 2023-04-30 07:17 - reign of heaven

as I was watching this presentation, I noticed that matthew makes some very strong changes to the text, specifically to establish that there is a coming time of a reign of heaven (presumably after the temple destruction) -- and while listening to this, I keep noticing how well this idea fits into my idea of these lewd types turning the world upside down (like shakespere), and that it seems to me that paul was actually instrumental in installing these archons into heaven, as he (and others it seems) seemed to have an etirely other world experience of christ, and then their conflict (with peter and james) essentially made this thing a reality, and so team james (the poor in jerusalem) was destroyed, team paul (and many of his opponents) off to heaven, and peter gets stuck here on earth. the archons proceed to rule from on high in this reign of heaven (that started probably with the destruction of the temple).

## luke-acts used josephus

(forgot to take notes)

questions:
- could judas of galilee be the grain/sower (philosopher) type which would form the philosophtical origins of the jesus sayings?
- speculation, but the 4000 sicarii in the desert -- feels possibly related to the mark's feeding of 4000 in the desert.

## jesus, zealots & sicarii

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/y0D9AvpdUmw)

- english translation for zealot is a negative word
  - one who pursues his/her object with passionate ardour; usually in a disparaging sense
  - one who is carried away by excess of zeal; an immoderate partisan
  - a fanatical enthusiast
- greek word zelotes/zelotai is a positive word
  - (aristotle) admirers -- imitators, disciples, students
  - (plato) "seven greek sages were all *disciples* (zelotai),*lovers* and *students* of the spartan educational system.
  - having a worthy/good object of emulation that you're attahing yourself to; you want to become better; more virtuous.
- josephus is using the word zealot in an ironic sense: that they were devotes/admirers of a bad example
  - josephus calls himself a zelotes of his teacher banos, bathing in cold water every day
    - which is interesting because baños in spanish means shower or bathe -- so kinda sounds like josephus' JtB
- common perception of zealots (because of the transformation of the word from positive to negative)
  - judea was a province under brutal roman occupation
  - zealots were militant jews willing to throw off roman occupation with violence
  - zealot is a general term for *judean rebel*
    - comes from a noble/justified biblical heritage
    - (num 25:11-13) phineas commended by God for killing isrealite for sleeping with foreign women
      - "he was *jealous* on God's behalf", using righeous violence
    - (1 maccabees 2:24-26) mattatias burned with jealous zeal (ezelosen) for the law, *just as phineas did of zimri*, in killing the judean willing to sacrifice to pagan gods
  - after 130y of (assumed to be oppressive) roman rule, "zealots" arose to declare freedom
    - there were lots of zealots (heb: qann'aim -- root jealous), and became name of military group in 66-70ce
  - josephus writes about the zealots in his story because they were there
    - not the case because josephus in parallel account in antiquites 18-20, he leaves them out entirely, suggesting that writing them in adds something to the war narrative (not forced; he could have omitted them or wrote something else)
  - it's supposed that josephus is white-washing his own involvement in fighting against rome, painting zealots as scum, concealing noble religeous aims and distancing himself
    - clearly not the case because josephus in book 2-3 talks quite directly (even in the opening sentence of the book) about how he was a brilliant judean general fighting against vespassian
- problems with common perception
  - no evidence that judea (ethnic zone in province of syria) felt roman rule as oppressive
    - in josephus own account, there's no mention of anti-roman sentiment; instead, there's a lot of anti-herod/agrippa/sameritan/samarian (anti-jew, anti-tyre, anti-scythopolis, etc.) -- lots of regional in-fighting and hatred.
  - contra to "life of brian", there are no roman army or officials anywhere near to jerusalem
    - the only "roman" military presence are auxiliaries which are hired samerians
    - roman emperors and goveners of syria frequently step in to protect the judeans from their neighbours
  - zero evidence for groups calling theirselves (heb) qann'ain because it would mean "jealous ones"
    - no such groups exist in the bible, dead sea scrolls, etc. (only once in 3rd century mishnah)
  - qan'a verb means "be jealous" (of neighbour, wife, success) -- a nasty trait
  - only person in bible called (ajective) "the jealous one" is God. (exo 20:5, 34:14)
- translators of greek bible--wooden or robotic, turning ordinary human jealousy into zelos (not normal greek)
  - used zelotes for ajective *only for God*, which is weird in greek cause God can't be a disciple or emulator (no plural)
- no "jealous ones": neither qann'aim (heb) or zelotai (greek) -- josephus' war is the only source for (plural) "zealots"
- josephus usus zealot in the normal (positive) greek sense of the word
  - josephus' audience (greek speaking people in rome) have no knowledge of hebrew definition of zealot/jealous or phineas, maccabees, etc.
- ironically, josephus also uses the word zealot to describe people he doesn't like: disciples of unworthy leaders
  - (war 2.444) zealoti of violent leader menachem, killed by another violent gang
  - (war 2.645) spear-carriers and zealotai of elezar ben simon, kept out of power, opposed ananus
  - (war 2.651) ananus had hands full trying to protect jerusalem, deal with so called zealotai (of elezar)
  - (war 4.160-161) ananus ... kept trying to stir them (the good people of jerusalem) up against the "zealotai" -- for this is what they called themselves, as though they had devoted themselves ... to good pursuits/models
- josephus is the only source we have for the group of people called zealotai
  - reading his account from the perspective of his audience (greek-speaking romans), his definition is:
    - rotton, violent, troublemakers like
      - menachen
      - elezar son of simon
      - john of giscala(?)
    - attracted men to theirselves followers:
      - spear-carriers, thugs, henchmen
    - which they theirselves (josephus claims) used the term "zealotai" to describe theirselves`
  - josephus is saying that they (menachen, elezar, john) should have found good people to make up their following, like ananus or other former high priests (worthy models). instead, they attached theirselves to these scumbags (inotherwords, josephus is mocking them)
- summary: these violent troublemakers, who will soon be responsible for jerusalem's fall attracted a bunch of people who thought that they were emulating something good, but instead, their followers ended up reflecting their leaders
  - the were interested in personal power and not actually interested in the well-being of jerusalem the way that ananus, jesus, and these former high priests did
- josephus is using literary language from greek tragedy, greek historigraphy (eusidites, polibus, sophacles, euripedes, etc.), greek oratory (demostanes) *not* biblical jewish language. (he's showing off his literary knowledge)
  - so, when scholars read josephus and plug in bible usage of the same greek word is a bit of an error, cause it's not the same context.
- zealots and jesus
  - nothing in common because josephus' zealots show up in 66ce as fan-boys of various strongmen.

### 2023-05-03 01:11 - YHVH the "jealous" God

one of the things I've noticed throughout my studies of the hebrews and the deuteronimic editing proecess, is that it seems to me that the septuigent came first, probably when the greeks/aryans invaded cananite lands and because they were greatly outnumbered by the locals, adopted the cananite/phonecian language. after adopting the language, they wanted to start to create an identity for theirselves as different from the greek-speaking septuigent, and so it was from there that deteronomic hebrew translation of the greek septuigent was created.

in this lecture(?), dr-mason presents the idea that the word used in greek to describe YHVH was zealot, which was a positive term, meaning idmirer (copier) of all things that are worthy of emulation, but that then (in a septuigent-first system), YHVH went from being a positive zealot to a "jealous" god.

in a lot of ways, I think this change generally reflects the other aspects of the deuteronomic edits, because it seems like they're writing the narrated/mythological history from a perspective of how is this all-powerful *superior* god, YHVH constantly letting us down -- and so in their process of trying to figure it out, the answer seems to be that they weren't giving YHVH *all* the praise, worship, offerings, and sacrifices -- and instead gave some to other (pagan) gods. that failure of *loyalty* is why YHVH left them hanging

imagine a moment how you feel after you've let down a friend/family member that you're supposed to be loyal to and you know the next time you need to call in a favour from them, it's gonna cost something. that's one feeling.

also, when I feel the word "jealous" (qann'aim), it feels to me like "do what I want you to do, or else you'll reap the consequences" -- and it has a notably feminine (picaresca) feeling to it, like an angry mother/girfriend/wife (even has the word anna/ann/an in it, like the sumerian deity (anatau), btw)

so, if I take the feeling of "required loyalty", and needing to call in a favour but it's gonna cost something, and also the "beware of the consequences (if you don't do what I want)" feelings together, this is the general feeling I get from the hebrew rendition of the idea of a "jealous God"

however, if I take the idea a zealotes God, this is someone that is kinda like me, constantly on the lookout for something new to copy or emulate in my voracious search for more/expansion/growth.

the problem is, a god that is constantly copying/emulating worthy objects/examples, is definitely *not* all-powerful or all-knowing in time and space, cause infinite doesn't grow and supreme doesn't shape-shift or emulate.

so, to paint a picture of an infinite and supreme god, I think the hebrew scribes building their nation's religious belief/identity superimposed their idea of what a supreme and infinite god would look like (sorta like how I think the greeks did with the concept of zeus/god, mars/war and aphrodite/love).

I became interested in this word because it seems it's not a normal word. my first intuition on figuring it out was that it's a reflexive idea/verb. to explain, I noticed that the stem there is "zelo", and then add on "tes". well, in spanish if I wanted to say "verb yourself", I add on the suffix "te" to the end of the verb. seems simple. I then looked up the greek suffix for "tes" which seems to be taking an idea/denomination/identity and then making it the nom case. so, "an american" becomes "americantes" -- which has a sense of self-identifying to me when I say it, which kinda confirmed my suspicion that it's a self-identifying "zelo"...

now, I looked up the exodus zealot verses to see what I could see, and there's nothing strange or jumping out to me about those verses. I thought for sure, they'd be a lot different in their rendering, cause if it's a self-emulating god, then the law would read really differently, but it seems to be too close or exactly the same as the hebrew version. it seems strange to me how much differently other books like isiah read compared to the hebrew vs this one, but I could be reading into it a bit. well, dead end there. nvm.

this seems to me to be yet another reference to jupiter. just wanted to note it, cause I feel it'll be relevant soon :)
