# individualistic perception of time

draft/brainstorming

### percption of time in terms of individuality

OK, I think I'll take stab at this idea. it's really far from my headspace right now, so I'm kinda forcing it to come forward in a new way. it takes me a minute to get going, so I'm going to start just by reveiwing what I remember, and then look up at my notes.

history was defined by (hedegger?) to be perceived in one of three ways:

#### antiquarian

which is the idea that our best days are behind us, the golden age has passed, and we're watching a slow motion train wrech as civilisation and our ideals slowly erode.

that's often a bleak way of looking at it, so instead we say that we're out of harmony with nature, and that mother nature is rejecting us, and that's why there are so many things going wrong. the conclusion therefore is that we must find a way to restore ourselves into harmony with this universal or absolute force which requires our harmony to function.

another interesting attribute of the antiquarian perspective of history is that it assumes that the "natural order" that we're supposed to harmonise with, is absolute and needs us to tune to it, rather than it to us. obviously this is not the way that nature works as all secies and habitat have a somewhat symbiotic relationship. termites destroy trees, ants compteletely dominate large portions of soil, etc. so, what this is sounding to me is that the proposed "natural order" ideology is motivated in some way or another. some trees build up termite defense and some trees build up defenses to lightning strikes and things... it's a somewhat chaotic relationhip how things interact, and when one really sits down to figure out the "natural order" of things, one may come to the conclusion that forrests are burnt and destroyed periodically as an "order". oops, derailed. I think that concept is going to be important though, because nature is composed of countless individuals, and though it contains a considerable amount of chaos, there is some aspect of "order".

going with the idea that things are constantly becoming an inferior version of its former self, then there needs to be a "saviour" or some kind of unifying force which will restore order and return the society back it its former glory.

what interests me, is where does this force come from? personally, I subscribe to the LOA perspective of things, where consideration of unwanted, *does* produce wanted, and it's usually the case that an entire group of people focused on the slow motion train wreck are going to see the way forward. it always takes a different perespective -- one that is radically different enough from the train wreck to be able to see the things.

though a forest burns down many trees slide down the side of a hill in a mudslide, it never grows back the same way.

the other thing that heidegger (or maybe it was jason) said was that it's good to incorporate these perspectives depending on what time your in. an antiquqrian perspective may be very good after a depression or a war, but wouldn't work well at the hight of advancement.

#### critical

this view of history is one where everything present was a "necessary evil" or even a conspiracy directly put into place for mal purposes.

all existing infrastructure is perceived as awful and needing to be replaced. this perspective is common in software development as a precursor perspective or justification for a rewrite.

---

although it exists and you see it all the time in the news media and/or reasons, jusifications, and excuses for making changes to the costitution or whatever, I don't really find this perspective to be very helpful. you can't really focus on all of the things that you don't like come out with something that you do like.

to illustrate this, I'll go back to software development. I've seen a lot of rewrites turn out pretty OK, but they're never replacing the whole system. they usually focus on subsystems, and they have a number of tests to verify functionality is what is intended. the successful rewrites also have a migration stragegy to ensure that existing services and infrastructure is not interrupted, allowing for adoption to happen gradually, rather than forcing the adoption of a new interface the same day it's done.

what I mean by this is -- and I don't really know my history very well, but I would imagine that russia had a pretty critical perspective of the former soviet union, and so large portions of infrastructure was replaced with "better" infrastructure, but I would imagine that it's actually pretty similar at its core. I do know that the new iraq and afhghanastan "democracy" isn't all that much better, and probably in a lot of cases worse.

I've seen this same thing happen various times in software development, where the proposed new system turns out to be just as big of a tangled mess as the previous one (I'm speaking mostly of my own code), and the reason for this, I believe is that my own concept of my code didn't actually improve. I tried to rewrite the code to cosmetically look better, but eventually it had to conform to my internal concept of the code.

---

to understand what I mean by this, imagine for a moment that instead of looking at the societ union or a codebase, pretend instead we're looking at some massive blunder in my past, and trying to figure out a way forward. let's say I crashed my car and I don't have any money to buy a new one and I need transportation badly. to give a critical perspective to it, let's imagine I was drunk driving so it's unavoidably my fault for being stupid.

I like this example because I don't separate one part of my brain out and say, that part of my brain is the "government" and they did it all wrong. if they hadn't have been screwing around making a bunch of lousy choices, I'd still have a car to drive. it's easy to point the finger at someone else and say they're the reason for the failure, but no matter how it came, it was an mutually attracted future. perhaps many people (or other parts of your brain) were saying, "if you keep drinking and driving like that, you're gonna crash" -- and so then finally it happens.

I've already got a pretty critical view of my own brain by the time the accident happens, and almost certainly I'll continue to have a an even more critical response to my own brain: "see, told you so" "I knew it" etc. so now, I'm going to continue to be pretty critical of myself, and so no matter what I do, I'll keep finding new ways to verify that critisism of myself.

governments are the same way. they, like humans, also have to adhere to the "I told you so" and "once you've sinned, you're tainted forever" sort of attitude.

if you were to look at yourself or an entity (government, person, software, corporation), the concept has a trajectory through time. the direction that it's heading continues on in roughly the same direction, depending on how much inertia it has, so even if you have something as small as a proton moving very very rapidly, it'll plow into something and continue on with its trajectory for quite some time before slowing down enough to go a different directions. a crash and burn does often alter the trajectory a little bit, but typically it carries on in the direction of its inertia.

the orientation of that vector is the perspective that the entity has -- so no matter how many tanks enforce a new order, it'll eventually conform to its perspective, even if it's under the control of a new ruling nation.

---

so, what to do about it? there isn't much that can be done, as it'll continue to keep repeating the same thing, but each time a little bit differently. somebody needs to find a way to alter the perspective of that entity (government, car accident, codebase, one's own past, etc.) this doesn't really solve the problem though, because imagine I have some code and I hire some consultants to clean it up. while they clean it up, the code will begin to conform to their concept of it, and like a newly cleaned house that is perceived as perpetually dirty, it'll eventually return back to the state that it's perceived as.

there really isn't anything that can be done about it, unfortunately. my experience has been that I can do various physical exercises to get my body to move in different ways, but that doesn't make my body move differently. it's the new awareness that I get of my body that actually changes how I move.

it's possible for someone hire a cleanup crew to maintain a house or codebase in a clean state, but ever notice how when they "clean" it, now you can't find anything? it's because you expect the thing to be in the location that it would be in its dirty state. if you were to change your mind to find the items in their clean places, your own concept of the house/room/code has changed, and so it'll conform to that.

governments are no different, as this is a fundamental aspect of time.

I've given this concept of time a lot of thought, and it's why I have such a strong opinion of a "saviour" or anyone's desire to just magically zap it so that it could be different (like winning the lottery), because I know that changes in physical conditions will *not* have any effect on your reality if you're a powerful attractor.

this works both ways, because I could have poor physical conditions, and attract something which reflects my perception in a strong way. it doesn't matter if that perception is one of improvement of deterioration. the stronger of an attractor you become, the more I have to take responsibility for everything in my physical experience, because I know it's a reflection of my mental state. if I see things as constantly improving, then they will. this has nothing to do with physical conditions. if I see things as deteriorating (as in antiquarian perspective), then they will continue that.

in a lot of ways, this perspective is the same as the antiquarian perspective, however, it's arriving to its perspective by looking at the details, where as the antiquarian perspective looks at the ideals rather than the individual systems.
