ideas that come to me in the moment

- the commit button, I'd like to save a default state for the button ("commit and push") but, there are no checkboxes by the side to keep them selected

- I would love a plugin or something where I could have a macro for each line select the text, but then the other (main) feature would be to display the text highlighted with all of the words as kind of like buttons where they can be dragged around inside of the sentence. same with punctuation (it can be added and deleted)
