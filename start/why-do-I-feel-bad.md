# why do I feel bad?

so far, I have noticed two main causes for not feeling good. they are bad-feeling-conditions (post-manifestation), and bad-feeling-perception (pre-manifestation). conditions are usually things like physical circumstances, but they can also be perceived circumstances. therefore, it's a bit more of a gradient between physical and perceived conditions.

likewise, perception is the way that one processes those perceived conditions and assigns them meaning. that those perceived conditions, combined with that logic is what causes an emotional reaction.

### example 1

#### setup

- let's say I have something that happened in my past which I perceive to be bad, and so therefore I feel bad about it. 

- more specifically, let's say that someone let me down or I wasn't able to get something that I wanted.

#### helper concepts

- the reason why I feel bad is because I perceive those conditions in a way which feels bad.

- there is always a way for me to rearrange my logic (my perception of those conditions) so that those conditions no longer feel bad. I *can* find a way to feel good.

- I know that all things present in my experience -- everything that has happened (post-manifestation) are all 100% attracted (no exceptions).

#### inference

- my logic concluded that those conditions would make me feel a certain way.

- it was something that I *thought* I wanted.

- therefore, I can perhaps assume with reasonable certainty that it may *not* have actually been the path I wanted to take to feel that way.

- right now, I probably believe those conditions are only way that I think I can feel that way. in reality though, there are likely many ways to feel that way.

therefore, because there are so many paths toward feeling like that, nothing really is lost.

- in fact, it's only my perception that because those imagined conditions didn't happen, that I won't be able to feel that way.

- thinking that I'm unable to feel like that is what really feels bad.

#### recap

- my logic was, that I need certain conditions for me to feel the way I want to feel.

- my perception was that I'll never be able to feel that way once those conditions became unattainable.

- the realisation is that the way that I feel does not have to be directly linked to the conditions around me.


### example 2

#### setup

that person needs to pay for their wrongdoing

if I'm the only one making an effort to feel good, then people will walk all over me or take advantage of me.
