She: Deare how doe thy wining eyes
My sences wholy ty?

She: Chang in mee?

She: When I chang, or chuse butt thee
Then changed bee mine eyes;

She: How can I
Ever fly wher such parfection lies?

She: In thy hart can never move
A thought soe ill, soe strang.

She: Never I could from thy love estrang:

She: Vertue, beauty, fayth in thee
Which live will, though thou dead:

She: Nott wher lies a minde soe richly sped;

She: None unto soe chaste a minde
Should ever bee unjust






Sh 2: Sence of sight wherin most lies
Chang, and variety,

Sh 2: Choyse in thee some new delights to try;

Sh 2: When you absent see nott mee
Will you nott breake thes tyes?

Sh 2: I must yett more try thy love
How if that I should chang?

Sh 2: Say I dy?

Sh 2: Dead what can'st thou love in mee
When hope, with lyfe is fled?

Sh 2: Beauty dies

Sh 2: Thou dost speake soe faire, soe kind
I can nott chuse butt trust:

Sh 2: Then thus rest
True possest of love without mistrust.

I
Love me Sweet, with all thou art,
   Feeling, thinking, seeing;
Love me in the lightest part,
   Love me in full being.

II
Love me with thine open youth
   In its frank surrender;
With the vowing of thy mouth,
   With its silence tender.

III
Love me with thine azure eyes,
   Made for earnest granting;
Taking colour from the skies,
   Can Heaven’s truth be wanting?

IV
Love me with their lids, that fall
   Snow-like at first meeting;
Love me with thine heart, that all
   Neighbours then see beating.

V
Love me with thine hand stretched out
   Freely—open-minded:
Love me with thy loitering foot,—
   Hearing one behind it.

VI
Love me with thy voice, that turns
   Sudden faint above me;
Love me with thy blush that burns
   When I murmur *Love me!*

VII
Love me with thy thinking soul,
   Break it to love-sighing;
Love me with thy thoughts that roll
   On through living—dying.

VIII
Love me when in thy gorgeous airs,
   When the world has crowned thee;
Love me, kneeling at thy prayers,
   With the angels round thee.

IX
Love me pure, as musers do,
   Up the woodlands shady:
Love me gaily, fast and true
   As a winsome lady.

X
Through all hopes that keep us brave,
   Farther off or nigher,
Love me for the house and grave,
   And for something higher.

XI
Thus, if thou wilt prove me, Dear,
   Woman’s love no fable.
I will love *thee*—half a year—
   As a man is able.

### On Fame

Fame, like a wayward girl, will still be coy
To those who woo her with too slavish knees,
But makes surrender to some thoughtless boy,
And dotes the more upon a heart at ease;
She is a Gipsey,—will not speak to those
Who have not learnt to be content without her;
A Jilt, whose ear was never whisper’d close,
Who thinks they scandal her who talk about her;
A very Gipsey is she, Nilus-born,
Sister-in-law to jealous Potiphar;
Ye love-sick Bards! repay her scorn for scorn;
Ye Artists lovelorn! madmen that ye are!
Make your best bow to her and bid adieu,
Then, if she likes it, she will follow you.

### Ode to Psyche (original)

O Goddess! hear these tuneless numbers, wrung
    By sweet enforcement and remembrance dear,
And pardon that thy secrets should be sung
    Even unto thine own soft-conched ear:
Surely I dreamt to-day, or did I see
    The winged Psyche with awaken’d eyes?
I wander’d in a forest thoughtlessly,
    And, on the sudden, fainting with surprise,
Saw two fair creatures, couched side by side
    In deepest grass, beneath the whispering fan
    Of leaves and trembled blossoms, where there ran
        A brooklet, scarce espied:

‘Mid hush’d cool-rooted flowers, fragrant-eyed,
    Blue, freckle-pink, and budded syrian,
They lay calm-breathing on the bedded grass;
    Their arms embraced, and their pinions too;
    Their lips touch’d not, but had not bade adieu,
As if disjoined by soft-handed slumber,
And ready still past kisses to outnumber
    At tender eye-dawn of aurorean love:
        The winged boy I knew;
But who wast thou, O happy, happy dove?
        His Psyche true!

O latest born and loveliest vision far
Of all Olympus’ faded hierarchy!
Fairer than Phoebe’s sapphire-region’d star,
Or Vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky;
Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none,
Nor altar heap’d with flowers;
Nor virgin-choir to make delicious moan
Upon the midnight hours;
No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet
From chain-swung censer teeming;
No shrine, no globe, no oracle, no heat
Of pale-mouthed prophet dreaming.

O Bloomiest! though too late for antique vows,
Too, too late for the fond believing lyte,
When holy were the haunted forest boughs,
Holy the air, the water, and the fire;
Yet even in these days so far retir’d
From happy pieties, thy lucent fans,
Fluttering among the faint Olympians,
I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspired.
So let me be thy choir, and make a moan
Upon the midnight hours;
Thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe, thy incense sweet
From swinged censer teeming;
Thy shrine, thy grove, thy oracle, thy heat
Of pale-mouth’d prophet dreaming.

Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane
In some untrodden region of my mind,
Where branched thoughts, new grown with pleasant pain,
Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind:
Far, far around shall those dark-cluster’d trees
Fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep;
And there by zephyrs, streams, and birds, and bees,
The moss-lain Dryads shall be lull’d to sleep;
And in the midst of this wide quietness
A rosy sanctuary will I dress
With the wreath’d trellis of a working brain,
With buds, and bells, and stars without a name,
With all the gardener Fancy e’er could feign,
Who breeding glowers, will never breed the same:
And there shall be for thee all soft delight
That shadowy thought can win,
A bright torch, and a casement ope at night,
To let warm Love glide in!

With all the gardener Fancy ev’ver could fame,
Who breeding flowers, never stays the same:
And there shall be for thee all soft delight
[That shadowy thought can win,]
A bright torch, for all howers of the night,
[To let warm Love in!]
