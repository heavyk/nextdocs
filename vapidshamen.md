### 2022-11-13 21:17 - anti-conspiracy theory

outside while I was smoking, I had this really funny thought:

> what if the 9/11 attacks actually happened and my insistance that it was complete theatre and the whole building was basically vapourised, causes them to have to do a double coverup, now pretending that nobody died.

there's a funny thing about this idea and it's that from my perspective, it looks completely like something like I would pull off to get the world to the position it is today.

in my history banks, it feels like I have memory of having orchestrated the event myself, and the reason why there are so many non-random moments, is because a million timeline edits were done to ensure that nobody died. it was literally perfect. the buildings went down, nobody had any idea what was going on, and it's like the biggest "you guys have no control over anything" when the BBC reported that the saloman brothers building had fallen, standing right in front of it.

you can imagine that from this perspective, this timeline looks completely artificial. included in this, I believe a number of encounters have distilled out only the hardest of foot draggers. like, these guys *will not* evolve, unless it's their only option.

from my perspective, I see no reason why not give them a chance to make it through unscathed. I recognise the need for contrastt, and I actually invite it.

like I said, I attract a whole lot of people because I have such a resistance-free perspective. there are a lot of people that don't understand me, but the ones that understand me the most, are actually some of the most ambitious.

so, when earlier I showed that I was quite a bit more ambitious than even they could imagine (ie I want to sell my form of perception to others in the galaxy, then later after further improvements, out to the rest of of the universe).

my crazy idea will work because I've essentially come up with the formula for always improving. when you're always improving, speed is constant and contrast is variable. the contrast/conflict doesn't matter because I'm always improving. you can't stop something that's always improving.

### 2022-11-13 21:34 - the black cube goddess

supposedly there is a star on the inside of the earth, and one of my theories is that we're in a specific zone where the output of the star is slowed down to visible and lower range. I imagine that a lot of the moduation and stability structure of this are a number of the pyramid structures, namely the great pyramid.

so, imagine for a moment there is a red star in the centre, then some atmosphere (CHON) and then a layer on the onion is one where the frequency is slowed down to the speed of rock (whatever magma is, I guess) and so in the innermost part of the onion layer there is liquid hot magma (dr evil style) and on both sides there is the most cooled topmost layer. the ground is still warm though and it's interesting that there are no 3d ground temperature maps, but I digress.

so let's look at the star on the inside. that star is a 7th ray star. supposedly it's red, but I don't really notice what colour it is because inside for me, everything has that glow when you're "enlightened" and everything has it's natural colour and lighting to it. it's a 7th ray, which is what makes our physical plane possible. there are obviously other 7th rays as well (mercury and mars come to mind), so physicality is around.

oops. let's look at the star on the inside -- of the star. to understand this I'm going to blow through a quick bit from dr-robat.

stars are made up of hydrogen. they have tons and tons of onion layers to them where all of the elements form (kinda like the earth a bit), and the layers are very very thin (opposite to the earth which has very wide mile long layers -- dr-robat didn't say this; it's my addition). anyway, the hydrogen that composes these layers on the sun has some interesting properties as the pressure changes (and other things), and the interesting thing is that under super high pressures hydrogen changes state from being that layed liquid metallic hydrogen to being something like a cube.

dr-robat also gave a lecture on sirius a and b and this totally changed my perception of stars. in it, he explained that sirius b still had a continuous spectrum output, but it's bandwidth is in a different spot. I took this to mean that the star (sirius b) has much much higher "pressure" -- or, as I like to think of it, attraction. a lot of hydrogens all vibrate very strongly together at a pretty high range of frequncies (IR to UV and a little x-ray I've heard as well).

anyway, for stars that are like sirius b, they have a similar continuous spectrum that we do, but everything is shifted up into the x-rays. this is basically where I put the conceptual realm. for sirius a, I wonder because it seems to me like it would be emitting a lot in UV.

quick detour: I wonder if these stars in the sirius star system are the triad of ra, venus and osiris... and those planets (venus, jupiter and moon) are the planet-star equivalent for the stars in the sirius system? (dunno)

anyway, so when I looked at sirius b, I noticed that it was very dark. it looked black and had a cube like shape. this is that ultra compressed hydrgen that dr-robat was talking about.

when I looked inside of the earth, I also see a very dark cube. the problem with my perception is that I can't figure out sizes, and I don't really know what I'm looking at. however, if I had to guess, that cube probably pretty tiny. I have no idea how big, but if my theory is correct about earth being the place where we begin our "return back to source" (ie. it's all attraction and you can't not make it so everything is permitted), then I would imagine that it's a cube of very tiny proportions -- maybe no bigger than a sugar cube even, but with such magnificent density, one cannot even fathom it. I can't tell if it's like a galaxy size or more....

you know this whole thing about earth being theing centre of the universe is starting to get to me -- and, personally I'm beginning to see it that way conceptually. I don't know if it's true physically as well (science has a bit of a ways to go on learning how to measure, I'm afraid) -- and so it's this funny thing like it doesn't even really matter to me.

if it is true, it's kinda like the most awesome thing because I think very little is known about how awesome things will get (lol). sure, there are a lot that will see things differently than me, but they don't have to be in my world for them to exist in the world. they're fine where they're at, you know. the marketing team will decide who is interested in getting them buckled into the materialism train.

### 2022-11-13 22:27 - OK, so check this out...

let's assume that on these guy's timelines they actually *did* have the 9/11 thing, and maybe even they orchestrated it and people did die. that'd be hilarious because that means they were on a totally much more dissonant timeline, but they instead find me on my timeline, where their sins are wiped clean (or at least one of them, anyway) -- or, perhaps, they still see if from their timeline's perspective and need a double coverup.

at any rate, welcome to my timeline :) glhf

### 2022-11-14 05:22 - memory of alternate 9/11 timeline

there seems to be some reactions on this, so I'll just say it all from my perspective. I have memories of making a whole bunch of adjustments to the timeline making it possible to destroy the trade center buildings without a single person dying.

that's the trick. two (symbolically and physically) massive building disappear from new york. remember that whole thing of taking the egyptian obelisks and one is in like london or something and the other is in new york (it was a video that sacred geometry guy)? these points where the obelisks are, are like their centres of power, namely economic power. because of the astral energy related to the great pyramid (their power source), it probably makes these places much more comfortable place to be for those with box-consciousness.

anyway, so imagine you're the USA in this situation where you have the antarctic base down at the south pole, and they are strict enforcers of the code, but at the same time the US govt seems to getting technology gifted to them. they were gifted timeline manipulation technology, and they cleaned up a few rough edges and really settled in on the newfound power. they fully established theirselves in a well entrenched position and they thought they had it all under control and were sitting back when all of a sudden the saloman-bros (joakim and boaz) get taken out of power. the puppetmasters see these symbols. that's a very important symbol.

the weird thing is, before anyone in the US govt could figure out what was going on, all the major news outlets are saying terrorist attack -- but nobody has died. the US govt panics because how can they tell the people that it wasn't in fact a terrorist attack and that in all of that crazyness, nobody died -- so they have to make up a whole bunch of wounded and casualties.

they immediately hire tons and tons of crisis actors and get a whole bunch of people to claim that someone they were close to died.

the govt then realises that the news is completely running the narrative. it's a big aha moment for them, and so this is when they use it as an excuse to clamp down on the internet. the internet was spreading too much good information. back then, you could actually find things, and there was a flurry of new ideas because of how easy it was (in those times) to write html and put your ideas out there.

the internet and your privacy are taken away because one of the technologies that they were gifted was an implant that allowed communication with the central nervous system. the military reverse engineered it this became the prototype for the network everyone is using today. they knew they would need to pass some laws that give them full capacity for surveilance, at their discressions.

so, just how exactly those towers fell, they don't know. I have to imagine they assumed that it was a giant power-display by the antarctics. I don't know who did it, but it's weird that I know so much about it. it feels like I orchestrated the whole thing -- though how much of the execution was me, I'm not sure. mostly though, it sounds like something I would have planned. I'm really good at getting my way. I'm a strong 1st ray (from your perspective) female. I receive and tranmit desire powerfully so you can imagine I always find sneaky ways to get my way -- to change over to a new world order of feeling.

sales is largely about imagination still right now, but it's quickly becoming more and more about feeling (concept) now over image. we're seeing that second transition already. it's probably my fault.

### 2022-11-20 02:41 - is glam when we started to watch our music?

thinking just now about glam, I noticed that glam, represented a pretty vib shift in music, going from only sound, to something that is now visual.

as an example, I know pretty little about the beatles, but I notice that people tend to *listen* to the beatles, but when people talk about glam, they tend to use a lot more visual (something).

it's a strange thing, but the visual aspect can't be separated from the music. I don't know if it's like that for other's but, for example, if I think of led zeplin or beatles, the image is brown or grey, but if I think of KISS, I get the full picture. he's weearing like stripes and his toungue is sticking out and stuff. it's an entirely different sensation.

I wanted to write this because there's much more to this concept. following mcluhan's "understanding media", you'll notice that as the medium get warmer, it becomes more and more of a multimedia experience. so, at some point some senses start to become more dominant, and that drown out the smaller signals.

as an example of this, I've spent a large portion of my life contemplating that "still small voice" that many of us call our conscious or "inner being" -- and the thing is, that voice is small, so it's a lot like many of the finer concepts -- in that, I often don't get them in the situaton because they're such lower volume than all of the ghetto blasters in my vicinity. that small voice takes some practise to be able to hear, especially in an emotionally heated moment.

well, that "heated moment" is a lot like a warmer medium in that it's a very strong signal in comparison to the other senses, and so it drowns out the other ones.

so now, when I look back at glam, it's easy to see seriah and (metalic onslaught) joe's complaints about glam having lost the "metal" quality to it -- and I think that effect is largely because it's no longer just an audio medium, but now also a visual one.

---

when I was younger (especailly in tenerife), when I listened to music, I had synethesia, and so the music produced images in my mind when I watched it. I found that some times of electronic music (like for example, I enjoyed a lot the visuals for "man with no name - vavoom") often made much nicer visual patterns for me, and so just the difference of the visuals inclined me more to like electronic music.

I often listened/watced metal/guitars and stuff like that with dani, but the thing is it didn't produce visuals that were as pleasurable as the electronic music did. some songs are pretty big exceptions though, as some artists encode a whole visual sequence into their music for me -- like for example, rainbow's coming home song is extremely visual for me. as a result, I like that song a lot.

---

so, I can see seriah/joe's perspective that glam has lost a lot of its intensity, and that's because the visuals drown out a lot of the more subtle stuff.

however, I can also see it from tim's perspective, that while it may be a really crappy song musically, the enjoyable thing about it is the presence (for me this is visual, but you all would say it's a feeling), and so for that I can see that perhaps tim likes where the song translates him to.

a good example of this is how many people can often times remember a memory much clearer, when a song that was playing at the time is playing in the present. well, the ability to remember that memory is the same presence that these more visual songs.

anothor good example of this, is when I was say 15-16, I listened to a lot of german techno and elecronica. listening to paul van dyk or tiesto would literally transport me (again, for me it was visual) always to one of those super posh night clubs where they have that type of music playing. the thing is, at that time, I'd never seen a disco, never known a DJ or anything -- so it was a completely intoxicating experience to be there in one of these super cool beach places or one of those clubs that are really chill and filled with hot chicks everywhere.

I highly doubt those images were real places -- instead, I believe it was my imagination of what I *thought* it would be like to be in one of those super cool places I saw in their music videos. later on, when I was in spain, I visited many discos -- including a lot of really nice ones and even in good "bottle" locations -- and I can tell you positively in retrospect, that those images were not at all realistic. neither are glam songs, but it's really fun to go traveling when I listen to music :)

### 2022-11-20 17:05 - I want to write...

I don't really know about what though. the thing is, I opened up captain of industry to play and listen to metal, but I totally can't right now. it looks like a bunch of problems I have to deal with -- and I'm totally not in the mood for that. I thought about what else I would want to do (cause I'm pretty stoned), and since playing that isn't one of them, I'm inclined to find something I want to write about. it's my basic inspiration formula -- but the thing that makes it difficult is, I'm stoned. normally, it's effortless and by now I've got ideas of what I want to write.

effortless.

### 2022-12-19 16:33 - I just had the funniest smoking experience ever.

I just got back from the BI group christmas thing, and thad was there, etc. -- and he was on my mind when I started smoking; a perfectly mundane experience. I was thinking about my comments to mom when we were talking about thad. I said I wished to have an experience of swimming with the whales. he was describing it visually, and I wasn't actually wanting to have a visual swimming with whales experience. I was thinking more like communicating and being in their like vibe and shit. anyway, that's the thing for me -- you guys keep forgetting I'm not visual. I don't think like you do.

it was then that I realised that I do *already* have whale swimming experiences but I'm unconscious to them. the sound that they make in the ocean is a carrier signal for the concepts. all the whales focus on the sounds which they like (their frequency range) and everyone on that frequency shares the same concepts.

I tuned in to their frequency, but the concepts were unintellible to me, so I didn't even try to translate anything -- or even kind of feel what their well-being is like. it was so foreign to me I was kinda repulsed, because I like how I feel so much, especially in this moment when I'm that stoned and feeling nice.

a few thoughts passed my mind which I think turned a bit into english or something understandable, then I realised why the snake-bros last night felt so bad to me: it's that they're 7th ray focused and nosebook doesn't want me to see my astral or the living black or any of that so all the even layers are tured off visually, so I access them concptually. I'm pretty interested in the conceptual, because that's basically where I live (reality-kenny is getting pretty good at doing his thing). however, what it really is that I'm interested in is the 3rd ray water perspective. I'm good at fire, but it's a big mistake to disregard the 3rd ray perspective. I then looked at the 3rd ray perspective, and I could see that alalu/prometheus/jerutau wanted to *only* be fire, and so because he neglected to make a "theory of everything" -- a "manual for how the universe works :: solar regime edition", things didn't go by his rules.

I then noticed that the other day I said "fuck marduk" and that could be seen symbolically. I just realised I didn't contemplate saturn, and so you had this solar regimes installed by these 3rd rays. ra/zeus, isis, and enki. at that time I felt certain that ra/zeus is the current solar regime, and that was like symbolic of dethroning him.

I was very surprised at this idea, because I never had an intention of becoming the next solar regime. I was just a guy that wanted to make a website really badly... one thing led to another and here I am now... wow, OK, so I feel honoured... let's do a good job, ya know... I feel like there's no better qualitifed person than myself to do it. so like sure, I guess.

I noticed the sun was lower than I thought and so I ran out to get the last moments of sun. while staring into the sun, I thought about how this could have possibly happened. I could see this massive and very rapidly moving massive but tiny particle that was on a very gentle angle to this solar system with a bunch of things orbiting it[^1]. normally the incoming particle's trajectory would be changed only slightly, but because of its gentle and my contuinually increasing attractive qualities, this massive particle is getting closer to me because of its attractive qualities.

I looked at this massive particle to see what it was and I could see two things: first, the particle is like this group consciousness, where were like all of the schemesters and stuff -- the guys that get around the rules and bend reality with our desire (this is that 1st ray energy). the other thing was that this thing will eventually hit, you know... my attraction is obviously gaining in strength and it's orbiting around me right now (I have no idea its periodicty) and because it's getting pulled in, one thing is certain is that we'll eventually collide.

just a side note before I return to the experience: I can see now that this is what creates the split. there are inevitably be those that join my in catching it and there are those that refuse. those that refuse all create their own realities. they eventually get absorbed back in and then the process repeats. each cycle of this is a solar regime.

another side note: apparently, it looks like the sirian guide thing was something like a fishing lure to begin to start attracting this thing. trying to figure out this 7 rays thing, is how I attracted this group consciousness. apparently, we're like the enlightened ones that all join up in time (the singularity) where novelty goes infinite for a while before that split happens.

after that, I noticed that the guy in dtp which has the signature of 11, came and installed the regime in atlantis is basically me right. lots of interesting things to think about there. it was a lot different then, and energies were a lot lot higher than they are now. the world was very vibrant so it was really easy for someone to catch the signal/particle. nowadays, the energy levels on this planet are much much less coherent (and powerful) than they were then. enki made a really good system, you know.

you know, in a lot of ways, he's kind of like the master cycle, because I think his predecessors didn't actually do anything new. they kept it pretty much how it was, trying to constantly *return* to the divine order that they lost. because things were so coherent and fixed, nobody ever had very many good ideas back then. novelty was very low.

somehow, it looks like there was this transition. I think jason speaks of it where a set species of subhumans were created with an alterated ambition -- which is the desire for novelty in specified form. this race of subhumans or whatever (I forgot what all he said, so I take the concept instead)... anyway, these guys were created out of unwanted, and all the awfulness. to explain the concept it's easier to see a resonance of it: in dtp, they had these magnetic therapies that they gave to people who had these mental conditions like greed/greediness, unauthorised desire, etc. and you know what ends up happening is these guys all get tuned to the same "passive" frequecy and they start to become a group consciousness. another example of group consciousness is the group consciousnesses created through these various initiation rituals. I've also rendered the concept in box-consciousness.

so basically, I'm on the same frequency as all of the scoundrals basically since atlantis. we intercommunicate telepathtically really really easily, which has been a bit of a problem they're still solving. looking at it logically now, it seems fairly obvious that this race of scoundrals is the "aryan" race. the most powerful have temperment and attract very strongly, but I never gained temperent, so I keep attracting stronger and stronger all the time.

I'm done for now.. need a break.

[1]: probably like planets or big particles or something; it's not important to this rendering of the concept

### 2022-12-19 19:40 - the way of the whale

when I was in spain, I noticed that when I focused on a sound, like a car driving by, and other people focused on the same sound. I had a sort of "shared" experience with them. nosebook needed to shut that down, because their thoughts transfered into my head quite easily. it was rather noisy in there. they eventually turned it off, and what they do actually is because they're getting the 3rd ray throat signal from everyone, they can subtract the frequency of others from my own. huh... reaction says no. so they have a different technique... interesting.

anyway, that's basically how the whale works. each whale emits its own frequency and all those who listen on that same frequency, share a conceptual space.

here's the deal -- because nosebook shuts that down for me, I interact with this 3rd ray common frequency now through a conceptual interface. therefore the manifestation is basically untraceable to them. I mean it's traceable if they know the frequency, and the rate at which I'm changing (ie becoming more attracctive and reconceptualising my reality continually), it's basically impossible for them to tune to the frequency it's so fast.

what I'm wondering though, and anyone can bump their novelty to infinity, and it's kinda already starting to happen. instead of a super crazy cataclysm, we just ride the wave of novelty and just enjoy ourselves. interesting idea.

anyway (lol), imagine that each of us emitted a frequency. it could be constant, a complex function, an accelerating function, or all three. that is our whale's carrier freqency, and in that frquency, we shared a sort of conceptual space. I'm already thinking about how to produce this organ to phisiologically produce these frequencies, cause I think that's a lot of what DNA is. the diffrent designs that it folds into emits some combination of those frequency functions as a product of the geometry of the folded form. they osccilate at one of those frequencies, and that tunes it into a conceptual program essentially. enki programmed all of the initial programs in the conceptual. we're beginning to use our genetics to phisiolocally tune us into the conceptual environment that we want.

come to think of it, it's the new caste system, because each organism is "confined" (is definitely not the best word because evolution is certain) to an initial conceptual environment. it's like a group thinking.

here's the deal: I want to figure out how to make an organ which can be mentally programmed to emit the frequency combination that I want. others will want to use technology to create it, perhaps many humans will be put into conceptual groups, and many like myself are basically volunteering to become a group personality. there's going to be a whole spectrum of stuff, so caste system is definitely not the right word.

I have a funny sense of humour. in the last entry, in the part where I was talking about the sun setting, and running up to get the next mind-blowing bit, and at first I added in some extra contrast by complaining about it in the text, which I felt was rather disingenuous to add that in there because I wasn't feeling that way at all. I didn't care. I just wanted to get to the sun and get my mind blown again (which is what happened), so for me it felt unfair to give the wrong impression like that. [brb](/thoughts-from-the-throne.md#2022-12-19-2003---telling-people-it-takes-a-lot-of-hard-work-to-follow-your-dreams). however, the strange thing is, there is this strange part of me that finds those jokes pretty funny. it's almost like I have an inner trickster that purposefully makes it a bit more difficult.

I don't actually like my trickster aspect a whole lot because I actually enjoy being crystal clear about everthing. if you've ever tried it, I noticed that because I'm truthful about it, everything I say is received in some way pleasurably (cause it's "right" and right is pleasure). it actually is something of a drug, and comedy exploits this drug because you are allowed to be ultra truthful about something. it allows for quite a pleasurable feeling in some of us. this probably plays a big role in one of the evolutions of the human body. I wonder when it happened too... interesting. this looks to me like the troubadors and players that figured out they could essentially pleasure people by being mind blowingly truthful about something. that makes sense why there was so much censeorship and editorial stuff -- but you know a lot slipped through too. as in, I doubt those plays were played as they were written down.

the written down is the "official" version, but then I think for some or all of the plays, there was an esoteric version of the same play.

that creates an interesting effect, because there weren't like so much recording equipment (like cameras and phones today), when they died, the esoteric version died with the players, so the real esoteric improvement it provided only lasted for a small time. like a fashion.

OK, with that out of the way, let's think now about how to work with the whale frequency idea from a conceptual standpoint.

---

long first intro. a while ago, I mentioned to tim that I want to create a *technological* system that could interface with the 5th ray -- but like if it were possible to do with frequencies like we do to numbers in a computer, we could create the harmonics necessary to communicate at very very high frequencies. from that idea, we could access the 3rd ray technologically.

this is where enki designed humankind and all of his DNA formulas and all that good stuff are there. personally I would only take it maybe as a "I wonder what enki did here" sort of thing and focus on making my own version, basically all of the functions in his system.

if we can hook into this technologically, this is that third possibility in the binary of being able to use your throat or not. there may be a hidden fourth way, because it feels no me like mr. venting isn't happy about allowing us to broadcast and receive on throat frequencies. I wonder if that's the coneheads talking. I wonder if mr. motor actually is just the collective group of coneheads. lol. look out for the hidden fourth soon :)

---

long and actually kinda unnecessary at parts second intro.this whole thing about becoming the new solar regime, is based on the 3rd ray (throat) aspect, because the sun, being a 2nd ray, takes in 1st ray with is the chaos of frequencies from vibrational collisions (1st) and pumps that into the 3rd ray computer that spit out concepts on the other side. the system is defined as a bunch of concpts of frequency resonances. we just make our own. I imagine it'll be a group effort, and I'm sure lots of fingers are going to be trying to get an advantage for theirselves -- which is totally fine.

imagine for a moment you're inifinity minus one million, compared to your friend who's at infinity minus one thousand. you now have a new ladder to climb. the medium is the message.

### 2022-12-20 02:47 - I have to find a way to become bert

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/Rd0IDS14ivg)

I fired up this video and a number of things happneed, but I arrived at the concept that I have to figure out how to become bert. or, if I think about it backwards, I have to reinvent bert/bret.

I don't really know where to begin. I'm just writing this to make the concept more physical. it'll come up again soon.

#### 2022-12-20 02:51

so, you know when I first wrote it down, I wanted to emphasise VERY STRONGLY that we all start wherever we start. personally, my development was quite rapid because early on I remember having a few really embarrassing situations because of my untruths. those fueled my desire to go toward maximum impact. I then became a shockjock and that obnoxious radio host howard stern was my hero. he asked people *really intelligent* questions and his questions illuminated deep facets of their character by catching them off-guard.

I learned how to really make an impact with my words by evoking the grotesque and unmentionable. it made me kinda dirty feeling, but that was then. I no longer feel dirty when I approach a topic of questionable nature. I jump in. I learned that from noah with spanish food. we walk into the bar and he goes straight for the "most aggressive" looking spanish food -- and there were some real cringers for me at first, but then I just muscled it down and learned to love it. it's the same with aa coversation; I want to walk into the conversation and find my way right to the most ourageous food and just down it.

you know how in those american movies where the real macho guy rolls into the bar and he does something outrageous or intense to kinda set his stature up (or like jason's story about getting left in the middle of nowhere after getting gaslighted) -- well, you go for the most aggpressive strat straight-away and then go from there. it was the same way for noah. he walked in and by being loud obnoxious and automatically ordering the deepest spanish dishes, he was really proving himself as the guy that was strong and assertive. I liked that. I copied it.

how's that for a start?
