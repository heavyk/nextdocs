outside while I was smoking, I had this really funny thought:

> what if the 9/11 attacks actually happened and my insistance that it was complete theatre and the whole building was basically vapourised, causes them to have to do a double coverup, now pretending that nobody died.

there's a funny thing about this idea and it's that from my perspective, it looks completely like something like I would pull off to get the world to the position it is today.

in my history banks, it feels like I have memory of having orchestrated the event myself, and the reason why there are so many non-random moments, is because a million timeline edits were done to ensure that nobody died. it was literally perfect. the buildings went down, nobody had any idea what was going on, and it's like the biggest "you guys have no control over anything" when the BBC reported that the saloman brothers building had fallen, standing right in front of it.

you can imagine that from this perspective, this timeline looks completely artificial. included in this, I believe a number of encounters have distilled out only the hardest of foot draggers. like, these guys *will not* evolve, unless it's their only option.

from my perspective, I see no reason why not give them a chance to make it through unscathed. I recognise the need for contrastt, and I actually invite it.

like I said, I attract a whole lot of people because I have such a resistance-free perspective. there are a lot of people that don't understand me, but the ones that understand me the most, are actually some of the most ambitious.

so, when earlier I showed that I was quite a bit more ambitious than even they could imagine (ie I want to sell my form of perception to others in the galaxy, then later after further improvements, out to the rest of of the universe).

my crazy idea will work because I've essentially come up with the formula for always improving. when you're always improving, speed is constant and contrast is variable. the contrast/conflict doesn't matter because I'm always improving. you can't stop something that's always improving.

we are the borg.
