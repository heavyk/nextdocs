### 2022-11-13 21:17 - anti-conspiracy theory

outside while I was smoking, I had this really funny thought:

> what if the 9/11 attacks actually happened and my insistance that it was complete theatre and the whole building was basically vapourised, causes them to have to do a double coverup, now pretending that nobody died.

there's a funny thing about this idea and it's that from my perspective, it looks completely like something like I would pull off to get the world to the position it is today.

in my history banks, it feels like I have memory of having orchestrated the event myself, and the reason why there are so many non-random moments, is because a million timeline edits were done to ensure that nobody died. it was literally perfect. the buildings went down, nobody had any idea what was going on, and it's like the biggest "you guys have no control over anything" when the BBC reported that the saloman brothers building had fallen, standing right in front of it.

you can imagine that from this perspective, this timeline looks completely artificial. included in this, I believe a number of encounters have distilled out only the hardest of foot draggers. like, these guys *will not* evolve, unless it's their only option.

from my perspective, I see no reason why not give them a chance to make it through unscathed. I recognise the need for contrastt, and I actually invite it.

like I said, I attract a whole lot of people because I have such a resistance-free perspective. there are a lot of people that don't understand me, but the ones that understand me the most, are actually some of the most ambitious.

so, when earlier I showed that I was quite a bit more ambitious than even they could imagine (ie I want to sell my form of perception to others in the galaxy, then later after further improvements, out to the rest of of the universe).

my crazy idea will work because I've essentially come up with the formula for always improving. when you're always improving, speed is constant and contrast is variable. the contrast/conflict doesn't matter because I'm always improving. you can't stop something that's always improving.

### 2022-11-13 21:34 - the black cube goddess

supposedly there is a star on the inside of the earth, and one of my theories is that we're in a specific zone where the output of the star is slowed down to visible and lower range. I imagine that a lot of the moduation and stability structure of this are a number of the pyramid structures, namely the great pyramid.

so, imagine for a moment there is a red star in the centre, then some atmosphere (CHON) and then a layer on the onion is one where the frequency is slowed down to the speed of rock (whatever magma is, I guess) and so in the innermost part of the onion layer there is liquid hot magma (dr evil style) and on both sides there is the most cooled topmost layer. the ground is still warm though and it's interesting that there are no 3d ground temperature maps, but I digress.

so let's look at the star on the inside. that star is a 7th ray star. supposedly it's red, but I don't really notice what colour it is because inside for me, everything has that glow when you're "enlightened" and everything has it's natural colour and lighting to it. it's a 7th ray, which is what makes our physical plane possible. there are obviously other 7th rays as well (mercury and mars come to mind), so physicality is around.

oops. let's look at the star on the inside -- of the star. to understand this I'm going to blow through a quick bit from dr-robat.

stars are made up of hydrogen. they have tons and tons of onion layers to them where all of the elements form (kinda like the earth a bit), and the layers are very very thin (opposite to the earth which has very wide mile long layers -- dr-robat didn't say this; it's my addition). anyway, the hydrogen that composes these layers on the sun has some interesting properties as the pressure changes (and other things), and the interesting thing is that under super high pressures hydrogen changes state from being that layed liquid metallic hydrogen to being something like a cube.

dr-robat also gave a lecture on sirius a and b and this totally changed my perception of stars. in it, he explained that sirius b still had a continuous spectrum output, but it's bandwidth is in a different spot. I took this to mean that the star (sirius b) has much much higher "pressure" -- or, as I like to think of it, attraction. a lot of hydrogens all vibrate very strongly together at a pretty high range of frequncies (IR to UV and a little x-ray I've heard as well).

anyway, for stars that are like sirius b, they have a similar continuous spectrum that we do, but everything is shifted up into the x-rays. this is basically where I put the conceptual realm. for sirius a, I wonder because it seems to me like it would be emitting a lot in UV.

quick detour: I wonder if these stars in the sirius star system are the triad of ra, venus and osiris... and those planets (venus, jupiter and moon) are the planet-star equivalent for the stars in the sirius system? (dunno)

anyway, so when I looked at sirius b, I noticed that it was very dark. it looked black and had a cube like shape. this is that ultra compressed hydrgen that dr-robat was talking about.

when I looked inside of the earth, I also see a very dark cube. the problem with my perception is that I can't figure out sizes, and I don't really know what I'm looking at. however, if I had to guess, that cube probably pretty tiny. I have no idea how big, but if my theory is correct about earth being the place where we begin our "return back to source" (ie. it's all attraction and you can't not make it so everything is permitted), then I would imagine that it's a cube of very tiny proportions -- maybe no bigger than a sugar cube even, but with such magnificent density, one cannot even fathom it. I can't tell if it's like a galaxy size or more....

you know this whole thing about earth being theing centre of the universe is starting to get to me -- and, personally I'm beginning to see it that way conceptually. I don't know if it's true physically as well (science has a bit of a ways to go on learning how to measure, I'm afraid) -- and so it's this funny thing like it doesn't even really matter to me.

if it is true, it's kinda like the most awesome thing because I think very little is known about how awesome things will get (lol). sure, there are a lot that will see things differently than me, but they don't have to be in my world for them to exist in the world. they're fine where they're at, you know. the marketing team will decide who is interested in getting them buckled into the materialism train.

### 2022-11-13 22:27 - OK, so check this out...

let's assume that on these guy's timelines they actually *did* have the 9/11 thing, and maybe even they orchestrated it and people did die. that'd be hilarious because that means they were on a totally much more dissonant timeline, but they instead find me on my timeline, where their sins are wiped clean (or at least one of them, anyway) -- or, perhaps, they still see if from their timeline's perspective and need a double coverup.

at any rate, welcome to my timeline :) glhf

### 2022-11-14 05:22 - memory of alternate 9/11 timeline

there seems to be some reactions on this, so I'll just say it all from my perspective. I have memories of making a whole bunch of adjustments to the timeline making it possible to destroy the trade center buildings without a single person dying.

that's the trick. two (symbolically and physically) massive building disappear from new york. remember that whole thing of taking the egyptian obelisks and one is in like london or something and the other is in new york (it was a video that sacred geometry guy)? these points where the obelisks are, are like their centres of power, namely economic power. because of the astral energy related to the great pyramid (their power source), it probably makes these places much more comfortable place to be for those with box-consciousness.

anyway, so imagine you're the USA in this situation where you have the antarctic base down at the south pole, and they are strict enforcers of the code, but at the same time the US govt seems to getting technology gifted to them. they were gifted timeline manipulation technology, and they cleaned up a few rough edges and really settled in on the newfound power. they fully established theirselves in a well entrenched position and they thought they had it all under control and were sitting back when all of a sudden the saloman-bros (joakim and boaz) get taken out of power. the puppetmasters see these symbols. that's a very important symbol.

the weird thing is, before anyone in the US govt could figure out what was going on, all the major news outlets are saying terrorist attack -- but nobody has died. the US govt panics because how can they tell the people that it wasn't in fact a terrorist attack and that in all of that crazyness, nobody died -- so they have to make up a whole bunch of wounded and casualties.

they immediately hire tons and tons of crisis actors and get a whole bunch of people to claim that someone they were close to died.

the govt then realises that the news is completely running the narrative. it's a big aha moment for them, and so this is when they use it as an excuse to clamp down on the internet. the internet was spreading too much good information. back then, you could actually find things, and there was a flurry of new ideas because of how easy it was (in those times) to write html and put your ideas out there.

the internet and your privacy are taken away because one of the technologies that they were gifted was an implant that allowed communication with the central nervous system. the military reverse engineered it this became the prototype for the network everyone is using today. they knew they would need to pass some laws that give them full capacity for surveilance, at their discressions.

so, just how exactly those towers fell, they don't know. I have to imagine they assumed that it was a giant power-display by the antarctics. I don't know who did it, but it's weird that I know so much about it. it feels like I orchestrated the whole thing -- though how much of the execution was me, I'm not sure. mostly though, it sounds like something I would have planned. I'm really good at getting my way. I'm a strong 1st ray (from your perspective) female. I receive and tranmit desire powerfully so you can imagine I always find sneaky ways to get my way -- to change over to a new world order of feeling.

sales is largely about imagination still right now, but it's quickly becoming more and more about feeling (concept) now over image. we're seeing that second transition already. it's probably my fault. sorry.
