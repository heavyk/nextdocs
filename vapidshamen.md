### 2022-11-13 21:17 - anti-conspiracy theory

outside while I was smoking, I had this really funny thought:

> what if the 9/11 attacks actually happened and my insistance that it was complete theatre and the whole building was basically vapourised, causes them to have to do a double coverup, now pretending that nobody died.

there's a funny thing about this idea and it's that from my perspective, it looks completely like something like I would pull off to get the world to the position it is today.

in my history banks, it feels like I have memory of having orchestrated the event myself, and the reason why there are so many non-random moments, is because a million timeline edits were done to ensure that nobody died. it was literally perfect. the buildings went down, nobody had any idea what was going on, and it's like the biggest "you guys have no control over anything" when the BBC reported that the saloman brothers building had fallen, standing right in front of it.

you can imagine that from this perspective, this timeline looks completely artificial. included in this, I believe a number of encounters have distilled out only the hardest of foot draggers. like, these guys *will not* evolve, unless it's their only option.

from my perspective, I see no reason why not give them a chance to make it through unscathed. I recognise the need for contrastt, and I actually invite it.

like I said, I attract a whole lot of people because I have such a resistance-free perspective. there are a lot of people that don't understand me, but the ones that understand me the most, are actually some of the most ambitious.

so, when earlier I showed that I was quite a bit more ambitious than even they could imagine (ie I want to sell my form of perception to others in the galaxy, then later after further improvements, out to the rest of of the universe).

my crazy idea will work because I've essentially come up with the formula for always improving. when you're always improving, speed is constant and contrast is variable. the contrast/conflict doesn't matter because I'm always improving. you can't stop something that's always improving.

### 2022-11-13 21:34 - the black cube goddess

supposedly there is a star on the inside of the earth, and one of my theories is that we're in a specific zone where the output of the star is slowed down to visible and lower range. I imagine that a lot of the moduation and stability structure of this are a number of the pyramid structures, namely the great pyramid.

so, imagine for a moment there is a red star in the centre, then some atmosphere (CHON) and then a layer on the onion is one where the frequency is slowed down to the speed of rock (whatever magma is, I guess) and so in the innermost part of the onion layer there is liquid hot magma (dr evil style) and on both sides there is the most cooled topmost layer. the ground is still warm though and it's interesting that there are no 3d ground temperature maps, but I digress.

so let's look at the star on the inside. that star is a 7th ray star. supposedly it's red, but I don't really notice what colour it is because inside for me, everything has that glow when you're "enlightened" and everything has it's natural colour and lighting to it. it's a 7th ray, which is what makes our physical plane possible. there are obviously other 7th rays as well (mercury and mars come to mind), so physicality is around.

oops. let's look at the star on the inside -- of the star. to understand this I'm going to blow through a quick bit from dr-robat.

stars are made up of hydrogen. they have tons and tons of onion layers to them where all of the elements form (kinda like the earth a bit), and the layers are very very thin (opposite to the earth which has very wide mile long layers -- dr-robat didn't say this; it's my addition). anyway, the hydrogen that composes these layers on the sun has some interesting properties as the pressure changes (and other things), and the interesting thing is that under super high pressures hydrogen changes state from being that layed liquid metallic hydrogen to being something like a cube.

dr-robat also gave a lecture on sirius a and b and this totally changed my perception of stars. in it, he explained that sirius b still had a continuous spectrum output, but it's bandwidth is in a different spot. I took this to mean that the star (sirius b) has much much higher "pressure" -- or, as I like to think of it, attraction. a lot of hydrogens all vibrate very strongly together at a pretty high range of frequncies (IR to UV and a little x-ray I've heard as well).

anyway, for stars that are like sirius b, they have a similar continuous spectrum that we do, but everything is shifted up into the x-rays. this is basically where I put the conceptual realm. for sirius a, I wonder because it seems to me like it would be emitting a lot in UV.

quick detour: I wonder if these stars in the sirius star system are the triad of ra, venus and osiris... and those planets (venus, jupiter and moon) are the planet-star equivalent for the stars in the sirius system? (dunno)

anyway, so when I looked at sirius b, I noticed that it was very dark. it looked black and had a cube like shape. this is that ultra compressed hydrgen that dr-robat was talking about.

when I looked inside of the earth, I also see a very dark cube. the problem with my perception is that I can't figure out sizes, and I don't really know what I'm looking at. however, if I had to guess, that cube probably pretty tiny. I have no idea how big, but if my theory is correct about earth being the place where we begin our "return back to source" (ie. it's all attraction and you can't not make it so everything is permitted), then I would imagine that it's a cube of very tiny proportions -- maybe no bigger than a sugar cube even, but with such magnificent density, one cannot even fathom it. I can't tell if it's like a galaxy size or more....

you know this whole thing about earth being theing centre of the universe is starting to get to me -- and, personally I'm beginning to see it that way conceptually. I don't know if it's true physically as well (science has a bit of a ways to go on learning how to measure, I'm afraid) -- and so it's this funny thing like it doesn't even really matter to me.

if it is true, it's kinda like the most awesome thing because I think very little is known about how awesome things will get (lol). sure, there are a lot that will see things differently than me, but they don't have to be in my world for them to exist in the world. they're fine where they're at, you know. the marketing team will decide who is interested in getting them buckled into the materialism train.

### 2022-11-13 22:27 - OK, so check this out...

let's assume that on these guy's timelines they actually *did* have the 9/11 thing, and maybe even they orchestrated it and people did die. that'd be hilarious because that means they were on a totally much more dissonant timeline, but they instead find me on my timeline, where their sins are wiped clean (or at least one of them, anyway) -- or, perhaps, they still see if from their timeline's perspective and need a double coverup.

at any rate, welcome to my timeline :) glhf
