when you see/hear/smell/taste/feel something unwanted, that physical manifestation is also a non-physical vibration (existing, I guess in the "energy-verse"). well, that same frequency is also the vibration of what is wanted. the only difference is you. if you're traveling away from that vibration, it appears as unwanted. conversly, traveling travelling toward it appears wanted.

I use the words traveling toward which is a spatial concept. I believe it would be the same to say "more harmonious", "more aligned", or "better tuned".

to use sound as an example, if who you really are (which is the comparison that all of these sensations are compared against) were a pure tone, then alignment with it would be pretty easy, but that would mean you only ever desired one thing, ever. obviously, this is never the case.

for the sake of this example, let's pretend you're a pure tone. even if you could align perfectly to that pure tone sound up to 44.4 KHz, the source of you is *much* higher frequency than that. every time you desire to align to that tone, that creates another tone. this means, you can infinitely "fine tune" to match higher and higher frequencies of yourself. in fact, every time you align perfectly up to a certain frequency, that act creates an even higher frequency version of you. you can never align perfectly -- until you die -- of course.

you are not a pure tone though. you have had many desires and they, like you are always moving. this in itself produces an infinite set of upper harmonics.

that's really awesome news because you can infinitely "go toward" (better tune yourself) to who you really are (your source).
