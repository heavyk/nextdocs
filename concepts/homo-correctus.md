# homo-correctus

a species of humans determined to ensure that others conform to "the right way" of doing things. (adapted from snake-bros)

### 2023-01-26 16:19 - optimisation vs novelty

lately, I've been having a bit of fun with the "homo correctus" concept. while homo-correctus has been around for millenia, in the form of religious and political zealots, I've been exploring the concept in terms of the supposed emergence of "homo superior" -- a race of highly tuned and optimised humans, designed to have physical and mental superiority over other humans.

the basic idea behind "homo superior" is that advances in genetics and bioengineering will lead to humans, essentially without flaws. I personally haven't heard that "homo superior" has any novel capabilities or features, just that it gets around a lot of the deficiencies present-day humans have, optimising their appearance and removing defects.

in software development, there are essentially two types of programmers: onest that do something new, and ones that optimise existing functionality. personally, I've been a programmer that'd tried to take existing functionality and redesign it in a new way -- often times doing things the "wrong way".

as an example of this, the way that I programmed tuenti was very non-conventional, mixing data and display logic. it was never intended to stay that way, because eventually the client would be handling all of the display logic[^1]. I had a lot of reasons for doing it that way, and I do admit it was a bit of a mess, but it was never intended to stay that way. when thomasz joined the team, he wanted to move over to a MVC layout because that was the emerging "right way" to do things -- which was fine, cept that it was considerably slower (at least double) and bloated the code size by about double as well (maybe more, can't remember). I vowed to never worry about doing things "the right way" after that experience again[^2].

for me, the interesting part is trying to figure out how to make a new concept or interaction; a novel way of interacting with data -- and then let someone else do the optimisation.

I've touched on the difference between these two roles previously when talking about prometheus and epimetheus. I really like novel stuff, but only when things are running smoothe and stable. most of the time I'm out there doing the optimisation things, because so many are out there trying to do things "the right way". tomasz' MVC system created a considerable amount of optimisation tasks for future programmers, just cause "the right way" turns out to be considerably slower than other ways.

I've also defeated my own point in saying that prometheus is all about saying "I'm not gonna follow the trend, and instead I've decided that my way is 'the right way'".

so, which is it? -- is it better to go with the trend, or to do something new?

well, the way way that I see it, is that performance metrics are probably the way to go, but performance should never impede novelty. I also view going with the mainstream trends only when it's necessary to expand a team.

I would say that it's a good idea to try and push the novel thing to become the trend, but this is only really possible for slightly novel things, I've noticed.

technology is a reflection of our perction on reality, and so it's simply not possible for someone who is slogging through family life and a whole bunch of slow-moving every-day experience to value performance. I've noticed that the programmers with rapid perception and fast attraction tend to not put up with slow anything, and value those ms/ns much more than someone where they're stuck in a slow-moving daily life. most programmers in spain, when I was there, had their 9-5 job, and that was the thing that they were required to do. it was important to them their family/friends time and so they just saw work as a block of time where they had to get the minimal amount of work done in the time they were required to be there -- and performance reflected that.

it's possible for a company to put policies in place like google does where they have certain performance requirements, but inevitably for most cases, this is trying to get someone to do something that is unnatural for them, and so they come to resent me and the policy.

in tuenti, what we (I'm including zaryn here, because I think he was somewhat conscious of it) tried to do is to make the office and the people at the office become the people that you want to be around -- moreso than friends and family -- and by doing that, it builds desire for the product to do better. the more we all wanted the entire thing to do better, the better the whole thing went.

my system of building and running the project based on desire certainly did have some drawbacks -- namely that, there was comparison between people and it looked really badly that some people, like rupert had a large amount of shares in the project yet appeared to have nearly no vested interest in the project. we all stayed in the office much more time than he did and he walked away with tons of money[^3].

as the company progressed, it became more and more difficult for me to try and get programmers to desire for the page to be harder, better, faster, stronger -- because more and more "useless" (from the programmer's perspective) would join the team and get huge incentives to do almost nothing, meanwhile the guys that are putting in the time to make things faster are not seeing any return (office space: "I work my ass off, and I don't see another dime"). this is a huge problem.

I'm not sure how to express this concept, but I'll try: 3rd ray is stablity and performance. 2nd ray is global perspective (that usually upper management has) which sees the whole project and so therefore sees "the right way" for it to go. the right way *can be* (but isn't always) an improvement. 1st ray perspective is entirely different: we are the one, true, best and most desirable thing to be around or apart of. we're the way forward. we want to make us better. my success is your success.

the desire perspective inevitably produces an optimal experience for all -- but I've found that it's kinda difficult to get that perspective when there's no incentives or kickback for improved performance. desire is always a reflection and so when pay/shares are limited to some bogus/outdated "right way", it's really limiting to those. the other problem with the desire perspective is that it requires all that are a part of the organisation to be able to see the big picture. income, earnings, and all metrics should be open and available to all to see, as it eventually evolves into a reflection of each individual's input. said oppositely: each individual should feel satisfied that their output reflects their input (within the context of the organisation).

some people only want stability, and so they should be put into positions that allow them to ensure the stability and performance of the organism. stability is a solid foundation to build upon, and some only want to be foundation.

for those wanting to take risks and do something new, they'll make mistakes cause that's what desire is all about, which is why the foundation/stability is so important. desire of those providing stability will be to keep everything smoothe, while the new things are created. they may not be able to see the big picture, but they can assure that do, to have a stable platform to build the new thing upon.

just think about how many organs in your body right now are working away at keeping everyting stable (3rd ray) so that you, the consciousness running the body (upper management), who sees the bigger picture (2nd ray) can build and produce something new and novel (1st ray).

I stand by my argument that "the right way" is a good thing, and that the function of epimetheus is also a really good thing, too -- but both of those are built upon desire; however alone, they do not work quite as well.

I'd also roughly translate my definition of desire to be rooted in the "triad of intentions": freedom, growth, and joy/fun -- which is IMO, is what makes the organism desirable to be a part of.

how does all of this translate into genetics? I have no idea. I don't have enough information ... I can try talking it through to figure it out though...

genetics, like technology is a reflection of one's perception. therefore, I believe the genetics should provide a stable platform for one to see from a 1st ray perspective.

OK, so there's this idea in corporations that the basic worker should be given only a the minimum amount to keep them satisified and not complaining. this, I believe is a reflection of the princely way of doing things: it's impossible to get everyone to like you, so just don't let them hate you. this is also how genetics kinda works: if it's decided that the body should receive no improvement when the big picture of the upper management (consciousness) improvess, this is the main problem with genetics ("I don't see another dime"). the body should reflect the consciousness inhabiting it. when the consciouness is perceiving things well, things go well. however, if the desiring consciousness desires something that isn't an improvement, the body is has the resources and stability to keep going. it's a tiny dip in the graph and so no problem. the body can continue to grow and expand for as long as it wants to. the person decides where is the limit. one guy says 2 meteres is good and another wants to keep on expanding till 3 or 4 and it's fine. when you get to the size that you feel comfortable stabilising at, you stay there. if later you want to grow more, you can. some people may stay their entire lives a child. you ultimately decide, depending on how you perceive your own desire in reference to your environment.

prolly something like that. very interesting btw -- lots of new concepts for me to think about too :)

[1]: tuenti at first only outout html, but the idea was to move to a system more like the one that we used in gatuness where only data was sent to the client, and then elements are created dynamically. this is how most single-page websites operate now using someting like react or vue to accomplish it; back then, no such thing existed.

[2]: I did actually do it "the right way" again, when I was working with marcos because again, we needed to hire another programmer, and I wasn't producing the framework that would have all of the things that I wanted such an ideological soccial network to have, fernando barely understood client-side rendering, so we opted to a sorta-html kinda thing (ractive). because of ractive, I came to like html templating, and eventually worked out a way to turn (most) ractive templates into simple js functions that could be passed to the browser and updated in real-time. for the server, instead of running a system that was more like dominic tarr's, I decided to juse use action-hero instead, because again, we needed to hire other programmers. eventually, that system can be replaced for one that had a more efficient wire transport (like protobufs or whatever), and it wouldn't be a problem. I would leave that to be a problem for a future homo-correctus.

[3]: I had to get over this pretty quickly because zaryn drilled it into my head that it's really important to have upper management making decisions for the company and not have the shares of the company distributed between a bunch of programmers. I had 5%, and that was pretty much the maximum any programmer was ever going to get. I studied rupert and what his concepts of "virality" were and tried to build up the ability to do what he does, and do it better -- because there was never going to be a time when tuenti would go to a more flat layout, so I had to learn for the next project, instead of trying to get tuenti to do something unnatural for it.
