# our lady

our lady is a part in the brain (I'm not sure exactly where probably near to the brain stem) that grants the capability to turn emotion into action (levitation, flight, etc). it also grants "the gift of prophecy" (that is, to see temporally and have an awareness of things not yet manifested). it seems to be directly connected to the imagination and also astral projection.
