this is a borrowed concept from BOTS.

[TODO: get reference]

the general idea is that kyle(?)'s friend worked for a telephone(?) company and the devices would lose connection from time to time and stop working. when people would call to get their device working, the fix was just to reset the connection. well, his friend thought it was funny to get callers to do more and more bizare things before resetting the connection for them.

he told one caller to wrap a potato in aluminium foil and to spin it...

"are you spinning it?"

"yeah"

[resets the connection]

"wow! it works! I didn't think spinning the potato would fix it!"

---

this concept relates to rituals and healings in the sense that you perform an action thinking the action is related to the result, when there could be someone on the other end that just activates the action remotely to give the illusion that the ritual or healing is doing the work.

or, "correlation isn't causation"

---

there is an even deeper insight that this concept has when related to healings. imagine that you are the guy resetting the connection and also the potato-spinner. your own belief in potato-spinning heals you, so to get healed, you spin a potato -- and it keeps working for you.
