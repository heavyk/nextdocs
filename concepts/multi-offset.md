# multi-offset

this is when you stack offsets. it's a lot like stacks-of-assumptions, but in the opposite sense. each offset is a an artificial difference introduced into reality, like a drug trip, sex, or music/sound, and the more of these you stack up, the more shakey your foundation gets.

for example: me; I suppose there's a way to get to where I am completely sober and without drugs, but that unfortunately didn't make that choice -- I desired drugs, so I used them. I don't know why it's a problem to "use" drugs because I use drugs all the time to achieve things that I want. all negotiations I witnessed introduced a lot of drugs.

these examples, along with many more leads me to belive that the majority of society is in a sort of multi-offset as bad and in some cases worse than my own. in abraham, they've accumulated a lot of contrast, or you could say they produce a lot of anti-novelty (habit,probability, etc.)

all I'm saying is that there are a lot of people that have made a lot of decisions because of altered states of consciousness, so we've all got a lot of offsets stacked up on top of each other.
