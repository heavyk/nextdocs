the idea here is that if reality is a reflection of how you conceptualise it to be, then you want to make the way you conceptualise reality normally, the reality you want to be living.

this reflective process happens naturally in life. it's like a dancer practising in front of the mirror. they want to manipulate the reflection into behaving the way they want to see theirselves perform.

that way, when they get up on stage, they're not hoping for something exceptional to happen. they want to get up on stage and see (at least) as good of a performance they practised in front of the mirror to happen.

similarly, special forces don't train extensively to have an exceptional performance on occasion, they train extensively to have an exceptional performance be normal. the same for highline, tightrope, and all other acrobatics and high risk activities.

my goal is to make it so normal to feel the way I want to feel, that feeling the way I want about whatever is happening in my circumstances doesn't require effort (feeing-purposefully).
