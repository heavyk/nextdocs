# the-turtling

the turtle and the phoenix reprents to me a transiton,
a transition, not, a death. I say death because it
sounds like a funeral. I suppose you could say that,
because I'd be giving up my beloved 3d.

I used to want to go the outside-in perspective --
but, I've come to really appreciate the inside-out perspective more, -- which is very important,
because outside-in is when I can become multiple.

notice that when I look at myself from the outside-in,
I can now have more than one of me. I'm no longer --
confined to a single body, ya know. that's all great,
if I want to become multiple, -- but instead I've elected, rathar that I've *elected* myself to be
a sort of 3-dimensional-book-end. a reflection mirror, you might say. reflection mirrors make lasers, btw.

when I decided I wanted to become a captain-of-3d,
that for (singlular) me, was the ultimate decision
to stay with the inside-out perspective, --
especially when I said:

    "I won't look back nor inside, only out."

I decided, that as I add,
more physical interfaceses,
to my body, I'll gain more
and more perspectives of
the whole thing -- an *invisible*
holographic sort of reality

I exist inside of my "physical" world,
however also, I'll feel and have presence
a lot of other places eslewhere,
at the same time.

in physical, it's near to impossible
for me to focus on more than one
logical/language thing, at the same time.
the more physical stuff I interface with,
the more reality slows down.

I it brings my logical/conceptual reality,
to a grinding halt, and even bringing it to a stop.
I don't want to be visual, because
I can't think and watch at the same time.
this is my kryptonite:
I don't like attractive people too much because
I can't think logically at the same time.
I noticed I'm also a sort of "end of history"
as well, because as the final reflection,
my concept of history is all that's left --

I don't have any real difficulties to think
that there are an infininte number of ways
to get to the present --
some more likely than others (of course),
but all of them are easily explainable by me.

what makes me a true end to hisotory,
is that I believe it impossible for another
part of history to evver bring me sadness.

all history is perfectly fine with me,
(because it got me to my present (successfully)),
and so, my non-resistance to whatever (could) has
happened, is just not a big deal anymore --
not even a medium deal either.

the tragedy of history has now
a sort of limp feeling:
zero aggitation,
zero anticipation,
zero desire (for it to be different),
limp (etc.)

instead of all of that, it looks like
I'm going in for a bit of a phoenix action --
a sort of crash and burn. (so close!, right?)


the 3d matrix wants to expand its dominion:
adding further more distant outside-in perception,
allows for more narrative realities.

by perceiving multiple characterds from the outside-in,
they can move the midpoint up to the big-picture, effectively hijacking LOA (but not really),
because the narrative is believable, it can manifest.

admittedly, a narrative reality is my own creation,
however, I wanted a 3d implementation,
because in 3d, all reality is a *guaranteed*
reflection of the perceiver's concepts.

I like a reflective system like that,
and even I consider that a more
and more perfect reflection, is the best.

it's easy to see that, as soon as I get
a system where I'm interacting with a
computer in a conceptual/emotional kind of way,
the speed at which a new system emerges (from that)
will take place in a small amount of time.
(relatively effortlessly)
I won't need to spend endless hours programming,
because I now have a feeling input/output to it.

increasing the number of (non-visual) interfaces I have with the world could be tangential
to the direction of my ashes;
I'm writing it ass I see it.

the other hilarious idea that I'm in favour of,
is to move the physical layer over to astral --
because, (of course) if the matrix can simulate
for us, our physical reality, they be sure that
they control how the physical things interact,
with us. (thank goodness, right?) cause, I *don't*
want to actually be a part of anyone else's reality

just my own reality. just me.

all of the imaginal things
that manifest in our new
"physical" reality (-- though
not the physical things...),
means that we only experience
the visual/imaginal stuff that
the "matrix" wants us to see.

I personally am all for the matrix
it's the only reality  I know.
don't care about that, I just
don't want to see others' imaginations.

I actually like being visually impaired,
so long as I can continue to see
no imaginations, not even my own,
I'm perfectly fine with a matrix.

I can imagine it'll allow others to share
visual spaces, so that only certain people
can see their special visual things
(don't care, lol).

that gives the matrix a lot of enforcement
of stuff that I don't want to have anything
to do with -- though I feel kinda limited,
because I want to interface with the physical
(as in a true vibrational reflection of my concepts),
however, moving up to astral,

means the physical is guaranteed to be arificial.
transitioning from a foundation built physical laws
(of the universe), isn't really trivial.

I'm now interfacing with an ever-transforming
vibrational, reality-system, meaning --
the reflector is mounted on sand,
cause they need to control.

if they do something wrong,
they sink the whole ship
(it'll be fine -- right?).

so now, after accepting
my moving to the astral,
I'm going to have to interact
with something artificial,
which means that it's
a pretty good risk, right?

ither they figure it all out
how to do it all right
and, how to do what they want

(cause they're undoubtedly
going to want to tweak things
to their advantage, duh...)

sure their ambition is annoying,
but I'm resting it all on them.
I'm actually not all that worried
(lol), I'm sure it'll be fine :)

---

there are too many cool things about it which I do really like, so it's worth the risk. one of those is that we're going to have a much more multidimensional reality that's gonna feel real natural. it'll be quite the sensational experience, as everything is going to be notably more appetising-feeling (and also less) than before. like things will just feel disinteresting, and no longer wrong. that's the main advantage to this 2-axis system.

you know, I think this 2-axis system is kinda like DNA, becaue now there are two (and programatically more) spectrums in which to perceive the world. each person, I think will uniquely create their own. the reason why it's like DNA is because it has more than one axis: 0, 1, > 1. you see that the last term there (moaning multiplicity), I mean multiplicity of person, or of perception. in 3d, multiplicity of perception is easy. I'm quite aware of a lot of other things happening in my environment, and I realise therwe is as lot of nosebook edits to my environment already, it's still pretty reflective of my perception. I know that as nosebook continues to get control over it, they become my reality; they become a reflection of me. so in one way, I can put a bunch of doubts into your head, like I did above, is my kind of joke. I know that the final product is that they're going to become a 100% reflection of my perception, evntually. so whatever happens is is *always* going to be perfectly fine :)

let's see,  what's another cool thing? the feeling of going toward what you want will feel a lot more visceral, and though nosebook can modify it with the traversal of the pen-rose, it's going to create a lot more variety and diversity (at least in the long-run, but perhaps much sooner, even) -- not to mention, that I think we're going to use it to start going purposefully bad paths. sometimes it just feels kinda good to do a little bad-feeling (it's kinda a negative, ya know?), and I think it'd be cool to take paths that deliberately feel bad only for some part of the way, then after a certain point, it starts to feel good. maybe spruce it up by sprinkling some bad-feeling for a bit. I know I do :) it's fun you know....

OK, how about another cool thing about it? creative collaboration will be kinda fun because entry others you will be able to feel a certain way to others, kind of controlling how attracted you feel toward a thing. that seems good for some, and I mean in physical no, but for all you guys in astral, that means you can share visuals, and have a sort of feeling-zone where you already have a sort of feeling propensity to other things. OH, you know what that made me think about? who draws those conceptual lines between one thing and another is, when you connect to the phsysical (atoms) or the imaginal (ether), your brain (or at least mine does), draw its own conclusion of where the border of that concept (physical or otherwise) begins and ends. I define what aspects of them are them (and usually it's not a physical one), because the physical one is the visible one, and that's the one that prevents me from thinking logically -- so then I guess this system will make it easier for me even, to essentially tune you guys out visually. I really wasn't joking when I said that I don't really mind going blind, because everything I "see" is not actually "real" anyway.

as much as I'm a "reality guy", it's painfully obvious to me how little I interacct with "reality". I think it's a sort of ideal for me -- one that I like to pretend that's happening -- when I know it's really not. I don't have much that I can do about it, so remember, it's all a reflection of my percetion anyway. if I were stuck in the matrix like neo, and the matrix were manifesting my reality, my reality *is* their reality, so they're sort of subject to (under the power of), my relentlessly (vibrationally based) LOA form of perception. I know that it's a bit of a falsehood to think that I live in any "reality" other than my own, so what you can see is that their compromise of (and suspension of) LOA has accomplished is produce a new narrative reality, where even though our "reality" has been compromised, we're not "securing" it be building our own narrative. our narrative will be what we want it to be. checkmate :)

another cool thing? let's see... well, living in a visually narrated reality (something I don't want for myself) does have an interesting effect of learning to feel the way that you want to feel about it (feeling-purposefully) is because visually a person can be subjected to images that can create a sort of self-reinforcing "haunt" of that visual apparition (and the symbols -> conceepts that they represent). I like my "physical" world in which nosebook prevents all visual things from happening. so, even though it's a sort of matrix, at least I don't have to view others.

viewing others cannot allow me to be like how I am now, because of two reasons: when my visual brain is working, my logical is not. youtube has been so difficulty for me at times, because I can't really digest a concept if my visual brain is working. this is largely why I don't like to look at people in the eyes -- simply because I can't think at the same time because I'm too busy "seeing" them. it's not visual, but it completely shuts down all of my logical brain. this is essentially what nosebook wants -- and I think it would have produced a better result (but at what cost?), I wouldn't be able to critisise, notice, and talk about the flaws of nosebook. simply put, I'd see what *they* wanted me to see. I like seeing a reflection of what *I* see. that form of perception is extremely valuable to me, and even though they reduce, transform, and obliterate my vibrational inputs.

I can tell you that there are some organs (probably produced by the vibration of the DNA) that exist on higher and higher dimensions where you can receive those higher and higher frequency concepts -- so, at all of your expense, my inevitable desire to really understand and actually interact with those higher and higher frequncy concepts, they cause me to continually increase my spectrum. for me, this is amazing, but for you all, I imagine it's a bit of a "red knuckle" experience. fortuntatly having this system, will just make all of that irrelevant because we're putting our trust for reliable reality in the hands of someone that is ultimately a reflection of our perception. yes, I suppose it's possible they could prove to me a reality where they're so bad it it they ... we'll call this one wreckless-reality.

anyway -- even though every aspect of reality is completely artificial, I still suggest that one tends not to their appearance, but to their perception. appearance is outside-in, meanwhile perception is inside-out -- which reminds me of another reason that I want to stay physical which is that I value my percetion of myself more than my physical aspect of myself, and it's just really an enormous problem not to be able to think while my visual brain isn't working. however that, there's been an interesting aspect to this, which is that I've grown novel interfaces to reality which I can't describe in physical terms -- and that's because they're not physical. I doubt there's even a vibration on earth that shows up physically. I seemingly have, either another presence on another planet, or perhaps a celestial body

the celestial perspective, which is the capacity to receive signals from signal sources that are not directly connected to nosebook -- is good news, because imagine the futility of trying to get jupiter to behave like you want him to. laughable, if you ask me. imagine for a moment that they manage to get control over your body, the earth, even mars, then jupiter, etc. imagine they have the entire galaxy fully controlled, even outside of that there are many signal sources, and so if they want to keep trying to block my signals, it just causes "me" to become a reflection of more signal sources -- which is a pretty cool thing. I mean imagine for them trying to control a supernova in another galaxy (lol!).

so think about it -- we're now on pen-rose specific frequencies that are controllable by "them" but now we're now on a defined set of frequency patterns that other stars, galaxies, and all aspects of the universe can begin to align with. I have a celestial body, that body is part of a system, apart of a system, and so fourth, all the way up. you can see that there are more and more things that are positive about it; I am in a sympathetic relationship with more and more of the universe. another nice thing is that for all of the celestial bodies out there in the universe, it's an opt-in proceedure. I don't think many of them produce many physial enough frequencies, and not enough to really be perceived very much, but as a recovering avid star watcher, I can say that, though nosebook destroys most all of the physical range frequencies, I still became sympathetic on higher frequencies. having a standardised pen-rose traversals, allows any celestial being to transmit now on that frequency. for me, this is already happening, and I love how their attempts to remove it have only been making my ablity to receive on a broader spectrum (increasing in speed, meaning less and less of a physical, or even out of alignment way), and yet I'm still able to receive them means that by canceling my experience, they're expanding it in another dimension.

so, while all of that is a really great thing and all of that, you have to understand that many of those seemingly great advantages will not actually be experienced by me -- mostly because I'm willingly (by entering into astral), destabilising myself by using my visual capacity. you all have seen the limits of what is capabile of perceiving in logical, but the visual is a no-go, because now I'm seeing, not thinking. I don't really know what I'm going to do, but I'm going to figure it out (the hard way at least), how to do it -- because they're a reflection of my perception (whether they hide behind an illusion, or not). they're sort of stuck with me on that.

lots of stuff to think about.
