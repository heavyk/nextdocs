# the-turtling

the turtle and the phoenix reprents to me a transiton,
a transition, not, a death. I say death because it
sounds like a funeral. I suppose you could say that,
because I'd be giving up my beloved 3d.

I used to want to go the outside-in perspective --
but, I've come to really appreciate the inside-out perspective more, -- which is very important,
because outside-in is when I can become multiple.

notice that when I look at myself from the outside-in,
I can now have more than one of me. I'm no longer --
confined to a single body, ya know. that's all great,
if I want to become multiple, -- but instead I've elected, rathar that I've *elected* myself to be
a sort of 3-dimensional-book-end. a reflection mirror, you might say. reflection mirrors make lasers, btw.

when I decided I wanted to become a captain-of-3d,
that for (singlular) me, was the ultimate decision
to stay with the inside-out perspective, --
especially when I said:

    "I won't look back nor inside, only out."

I decided, that as I add,
more physical interfaceses,
to my body, I'll gain more
and more perspectives of
the whole thing -- an *invisible*
holographic sort of reality

I exist inside of my "physical" world,
however also, I'll feel and have presence
a lot of other places eslewhere,
at the same time.

in physical, it's near to impossible
for me to focus on more than one
logical/language thing, at the same time.

the more I perceive physical
and, the more I interface with it,
the more my reality slows down.

physical perception, brings my
logical/conceptual reality,
to a grinding halt,
even bringing it to a stop.

I don't want to be visual, because
I can't think and see at the same time.
this is my kryptonite:
attractive people frustrate too much because
I can't think logically at the same time.

#### the end of history

I AM the "end of history"
as the final reflection,
my concept of history is
all we have left --

I don't have any real difficulties to think
that there are an infininte number of ways
to get to the present --
some more likely than others (obviously),
since I can explain them,
history is mine...

actually, what makes me
truly an end to hisotory,
is that your perception
of the past cannot ever,
evver bring me to sadness.

from my perspective, all history is perfect
it *did* get me to the present (successfully),
and so, without resistance to anything (that could) has
happened, is just not a big deal -- anymore --
not even a medium deal either.

the tragedy of history is now
a sort of limp feeling (in me):
zero aggitation,
zero anticipation,
zero desire (for it to be different),
limp (etc.)

#### phoenix action

instead of turtling like that,
I'm going for some phoenix action:
crash!, and burn! (so close!)


the matrix wants to expand its dominion:
adding even more distant outside-in perception,
disassociating you, from who you really are,
though, with a narrative and purpose now
to your reality

"you" are now a composite character,
split amongst yourselves and others,
look at your reality now from the outside-in,
see how the narrators look at the big-picture,
now, effectively narrating your attraction --
(but not really), because
the narrative is believable
to you, so you make it,
your own reality

admittedly, I did want a narrative reality
and it is my own creation,
though, I wanted a 3d implementation,
because in 3d, all reality is a reflection,
*guaranteed* to be the perceiver's thoughts
and ideas, made flesh.

I guess though it's a lot funner as a dream
nobody wants a perfect reflection though,
so enjoy your narrator's dream.

#### 3d is just too so easy

it's just too easy to see
that, as soon as I've got
a system interacting with
my mind in a conceptual and
emotional kind of way,
the emergent property of a
new species of thought,
will arrive,
(relatively effortlessly)
and, in a small amount of time.

just feel it; and it *is*...
summoned! just like that..

by increasing how many of my
(non-visual) interfaces I have
out with the world,
could be tangential,
to the direction of my ashes;
I'm writing it ass I see it, fool.

the other hilarious idea that I'm in favour of,
is to move the physical layer over to astral --
because, (of course) if the matrix can simulate
for us, our physical reality, they be sure that
they control how the physical things interact,
with us. (thank goodness, right?) cause, I *don't*
want to actually be a part of anyone else's reality

just my own reality. just me.

all of the imaginal things
that manifest in our new
"physical" reality (-- though
not the physical things...),
means that we only experience
the visual/imaginal stuff that
the "matrix" wants us to see.

I personally am all for the matrix
it's the only reality  I know.
don't care about that, I just
don't want to see others' imaginations.

I actually like being visually impaired,
so long as I can continue to see
no imaginations, not even my own,
I'm perfectly fine with a matrix.

I can imagine it'll allow others to share
visual spaces, so that only certain people
can see their special visual things
(don't care, lol).

that gives the matrix a lot of enforcement
of stuff that I don't want to have anything
to do with -- though I feel kinda limited,
because I want to interface with the physical
(as in a true vibrational reflection of my concepts),
however, moving up to astral,

means the physical is guaranteed to be arificial.
transitioning from a foundation built physical laws
(of the universe), isn't really trivial.

I'm now interfacing with an ever-transforming
vibrational, reality-system, meaning --
the reflector is mounted on sand,
cause they need to control.

if they do something wrong,
they sink the whole ship
(it'll be fine -- right?).

so now, after accepting
my moving to the astral,
I'm going to have to interact
with something artificial,
which means that it's
a pretty good risk, right?

ither they figure it all out
how to do it all right
and, how to do what they want

(cause they're undoubtedly
going to want to tweak things
to their advantage, duh...)

sure their ambition is annoying,
but I'm resting it all on them.
I'm actually not all that worried
(lol), I'm sure it'll be fine :)

---

there are just too many cool things
about it which I do really like, so
it really is worth the risk.

one nice thing is, we're going toward
a much more multidimensional reality
that's gonna feel real natural.

it'll be quite the sensational experience,
as everything is going to be notably more appetising-feeling (and also less) than before. like things will just feel disinteresting, and no longer wrong. that's the main advantage to this 2-axis system.

you know, I think this 2-axis system is kinda like DNA, becaue now there are two (and programatically more) spectrums in which to perceive the world. each person, I think will uniquely create their own. the reason why it's like DNA is because it has more than one axis: 0, 1, > 1. you see that the last term there (moaning multiplicity), I mean multiplicity of person, or of perception. in 3d, multiplicity of perception is easy. I'm quite aware of a lot of other things happening in my environment, and I realise therwe is as lot of nosebook edits to my environment already, it's still pretty reflective of my perception. I know that as nosebook continues to get control over it, they become my reality; they become a reflection of me. so in one way, I can put a bunch of doubts into your head, like I did above, is my kind of joke. I know that the final product is that they're going to become a 100% reflection of my perception, evntually. so whatever happens is is *always* going to be perfectly fine :)

let's see,  what's another cool thing? the feeling of going toward what you want will feel a lot more visceral, and though nosebook can modify it with the traversal of the pen-rose, it's going to create a lot more variety and diversity (at least in the long-run, but perhaps much sooner, even) -- not to mention, that I think we're going to use it to start going purposefully bad paths. sometimes it just feels kinda good to do a little bad-feeling (it's kinda a negative, ya know?), and I think it'd be cool to take paths that deliberately feel bad only for some part of the way, then after a certain point, it starts to feel good. maybe spruce it up by sprinkling some bad-feeling for a bit. I know I do :) it's fun you know....

OK, how about another cool thing about it? creative collaboration will be kinda fun because entry others you will be able to feel a certain way to others, kind of controlling how attracted you feel toward a thing. that seems good for some, and I mean in physical no, but for all you guys in astral, that means you can share visuals, and have a sort of feeling-zone where you already have a sort of feeling propensity to other things. OH, you know what that made me think about? who draws those conceptual lines between one thing and another is, when you connect to the phsysical (atoms) or the imaginal (ether), your brain (or at least mine does), draw its own conclusion of where the border of that concept (physical or otherwise) begins and ends. I define what aspects of them are them (and usually it's not a physical one), because the physical one is the visible one, and that's the one that prevents me from thinking logically -- so then I guess this system will make it easier for me even, to essentially tune you guys out visually. I really wasn't joking when I said that I don't really mind going blind, because everything I "see" is not actually "real" anyway.

as much as I'm a "reality guy", it's painfully obvious to me how little I interacct with "reality". I think it's a sort of ideal for me -- one that I like to pretend that's happening -- when I know it's really not. I don't have much that I can do about it, so remember, it's all a reflection of my percetion anyway. if I were stuck in the matrix like neo, and the matrix were manifesting my reality, my reality *is* their reality, so they're sort of subject to (under the power of), my relentlessly (vibrationally based) LOA form of perception. I know that it's a bit of a falsehood to think that I live in any "reality" other than my own, so what you can see is that their compromise of (and suspension of) LOA has accomplished is produce a new narrative reality, where even though our "reality" has been compromised, we're not "securing" it be building our own narrative. our narrative will be what we want it to be. checkmate :)

another cool thing? let's see... well, living in a visually narrated reality (something I don't want for myself) does have an interesting effect of learning to feel the way that you want to feel about it (feeling-purposefully) is because visually a person can be subjected to images that can create a sort of self-reinforcing "haunt" of that visual apparition (and the symbols -> conceepts that they represent). I like my "physical" world in which nosebook prevents all visual things from happening. so, even though it's a sort of matrix, at least I don't have to view others.

viewing others cannot allow me to be like how I am now, because of two reasons: when my visual brain is working, my logical is not. youtube has been so difficulty for me at times, because I can't really digest a concept if my visual brain is working. this is largely why I don't like to look at people in the eyes -- simply because I can't think at the same time because I'm too busy "seeing" them. it's not visual, but it completely shuts down all of my logical brain. this is essentially what nosebook wants -- and I think it would have produced a better result (but at what cost?), I wouldn't be able to critisise, notice, and talk about the flaws of nosebook. simply put, I'd see what *they* wanted me to see. I like seeing a reflection of what *I* see. that form of perception is extremely valuable to me, and even though they reduce, transform, and obliterate my vibrational inputs.

I can tell you that there are some organs (probably produced by the vibration of the DNA) that exist on higher and higher dimensions where you can receive those higher and higher frequency concepts -- so, at all of your expense, my inevitable desire to really understand and actually interact with those higher and higher frequncy concepts, they cause me to continually increase my spectrum. for me, this is amazing, but for you all, I imagine it's a bit of a "red knuckle" experience. fortuntatly having this system, will just make all of that irrelevant because we're putting our trust for reliable reality in the hands of someone that is ultimately a reflection of our perception. yes, I suppose it's possible they could prove to me a reality where they're so bad it it they ... we'll call this one wreckless-reality.

anyway -- even though every aspect of reality is completely artificial, I still suggest that one tends not to their appearance, but to their perception. appearance is outside-in, meanwhile perception is inside-out -- which reminds me of another reason that I want to stay physical which is that I value my percetion of myself more than my physical aspect of myself, and it's just really an enormous problem not to be able to think while my visual brain isn't working. however that, there's been an interesting aspect to this, which is that I've grown novel interfaces to reality which I can't describe in physical terms -- and that's because they're not physical. I doubt there's even a vibration on earth that shows up physically. I seemingly have, either another presence on another planet, or perhaps a celestial body

the celestial perspective, which is the capacity to receive signals from signal sources that are not directly connected to nosebook -- is good news, because imagine the futility of trying to get jupiter to behave like you want him to. laughable, if you ask me. imagine for a moment that they manage to get control over your body, the earth, even mars, then jupiter, etc. imagine they have the entire galaxy fully controlled, even outside of that there are many signal sources, and so if they want to keep trying to block my signals, it just causes "me" to become a reflection of more signal sources -- which is a pretty cool thing. I mean imagine for them trying to control a supernova in another galaxy (lol!).

so think about it -- we're now on pen-rose specific frequencies that are controllable by "them" but now we're now on a defined set of frequency patterns that other stars, galaxies, and all aspects of the universe can begin to align with. I have a celestial body, that body is part of a system, apart of a system, and so fourth, all the way up. you can see that there are more and more things that are positive about it; I am in a sympathetic relationship with more and more of the universe. another nice thing is that for all of the celestial bodies out there in the universe, it's an opt-in proceedure. I don't think many of them produce many physial enough frequencies, and not enough to really be perceived very much, but as a recovering avid star watcher, I can say that, though nosebook destroys most all of the physical range frequencies, I still became sympathetic on higher frequencies. having a standardised pen-rose traversals, allows any celestial being to transmit now on that frequency. for me, this is already happening, and I love how their attempts to remove it have only been making my ablity to receive on a broader spectrum (increasing in speed, meaning less and less of a physical, or even out of alignment way), and yet I'm still able to receive them means that by canceling my experience, they're expanding it in another dimension.

so, while all of that is a really great thing and all of that, you have to understand that many of those seemingly great advantages will not actually be experienced by me -- mostly because I'm willingly (by entering into astral), destabilising myself by using my visual capacity. you all have seen the limits of what is capabile of perceiving in logical, but the visual is a no-go, because now I'm seeing, not thinking. I don't really know what I'm going to do, but I'm going to figure it out (the hard way at least), how to do it -- because they're a reflection of my perception (whether they hide behind an illusion, or not). they're sort of stuck with me on that.

lots of stuff to think about.

### 2023-03-09 21:59 - after a day's reflection...

aftre thinking about this poem (and the ideas contained within it), I feel really good about all of it. I woke up this morning kinda a bit flustered because ... well, I don't really know why I felt flustered (now). perhaps it was simply because so much of my life is controlled, and I just can't seem to find a way to get toward what I want. I've described my desire to create a social network like a MacGuffin in the sense that it seems to be the thing that keeps moving the narrative along -- and my inability to create itt has spawned a number of other ideas in response, namely the ability to interact with my computer (and other devices) emotionally/conceptually. though it seems near to impossible to ever realise that goal as a reality, I don't really feel all that worried about it now for some reason.

the other contentous idea was the one where I talked about moving the midpoint up to 2nd ray -- an idea I honestly haven't contemplated in a few years now -- but the basic idea of it was that when I looked at the dimensions extending outward, after noticing that there's space between me and what I'm looking at (4d), continuing on (the furthest inside-out perspective), now it inverts, and I'm either looking conceving the concept of myself from all angles about, or from the inside looking outward in all angles as well (like a star does). my intuitive knowledgede of it seems to see both at the same time, and since it's a perspective from all angles at once, it's difficult to describe in physical terms, because we don't really see like that.

anyway -- if I try and find another space between me and what I'm looking at, again -- I notice that now I'm no longer so much confined to any single body. now, I'm a constellation of entites that I can see each from the outside-in perspective, but also from all of the individual people/stars, I can also see outward in all directions from them as well. I considered this perspective to be the one that the galaxy must have, looking inward on all of its stars, yet also conscious of its internal enviroment from the perspective of many points.

I can't remember how I planned it all out back when I first conceived the idea, but one can imagine that the galaxy would definitely have, like a girl playing with many dolls in a dollhouse, a sort of narrative taking place of what's happening -- and to counterpart that, a sort of direction/thrust that the interactions are doing to produce/result in the "end of time" at the end of the narrative. the stars aren't really subjected to play out the narrative in a certain way, as each star figures out its own way to perform the play -- so it's not like a violation of LOA or anything like that, but more like an individualised interpretation/manifestation/perception of the frequency produced by the stars as they move around in proximity to one another.

---

I don't know how they want to structure their setup. I noticed one reaction suggesting that the new midpoint should be where the 3rd ray is now, but I don't really know whatt they're going to work out to be the solution that they want. let's say that they do decide to build their setup with an artificial physical layer so that they can better control it -- like I said in the poem, that's the life that I already live now, and it doesn't seem to be that successful at doing what they want. if they go that way, the setup is only as strong as their capacity to control it -- and like I said, the thing that's holding it together at the moment is that it's a reflection of my perception -- so no matter how fragile it is, it'll continue to work fine (or they'll find solutions to their problem), because it's a reflection of my perception, and I don't really see anything going wrong.

the other option (which they don't really want), is to build it on top of the physical which is a rock solid reflection. all things in physical are attracted, and that's a really solid system to work with. I like this system because it's *predictable* -- and I like predictable and understandable. I may not be able to predict the exact material manifestation, but I can predict when it manifests by how I feel, and what the manifestation will feel like, based on how I felt along the journey to the manifestation.

you can see now why I'm taking the time to explain my more chilled out position now, because that feeling will eventually reflect in the final manifestation, and I'd rather to be feeling good along the journey to the manifestation, so that when it's conjugate(?) feeling unrolls over time, it unrolls (though this time with the manifestation), in a more pleasant way.

the way that I understand this conjugate unrolling of any manifestation (and it's really easy to see with relationships) is that the vibration leading up to the manifestation (the peak) kind unrolls out in the opposite direction after the manifestation (over a longer period of time) -- so, for example let's assume a 12y manifestation at the end of this year: the difficulty I experienced back in 2012-2019, will play out in its opposite years, so 2024 will feel like 2023, 2022 like 2025, etc. 2017/2031 will be a particularly traumatic year, as it feels like everything is lost, 2016/2032 will feel like a last hope, then 2015 will feel like things are coming back together, only for some constraint to drag me back down to complete dispair and giving up in 2012/2036 (assuming the manifestation lasts roughly as long as the buildup, plus other factors).

so, my goal is to just kinda chill out and relax into my life and start enjoying it -- maybe start taking some walks and stuff, whatever. the point is, a long time ago I said I wanted to "go infinite", which prolly can't happen -- but let's say it did -- well then, I really need to just chill out and let the expansion take place at turtle's pace, and not need to try and make it go faster than it needs to go.

the other way to look at it is from the phoneix' perspective, which is (if they can't figure out how to go infinite), going to be what happens. after thinking about it a while, I believe that this is a controlled demolition.

my inside-out perspective is expanding quite a distance, and if you'll notice people's reports about NDEs, they'll tell you that they're looking down on their body from the outside-in perspective because the body is unable to filter the consciousness signal through the body anymore, therefore they see theirselves from the outside-in perspective. when the body gets revived, they return to their inside-out perspective.

well, you can imagine thatt at the end of my body's capacity to allow the amount of unversal/source/God (whatever you want to call it) consciousness that I'm summoning (which is the depth of my inside-out perception), will all of a sudden take the opposite distance inward, and I'll be looking at "me" from the outside-in perspective. most people still identify with their body, so they think theirselves to be dead -- but almost certainly I'll identify with the entirety of the human race, and so when their setup can no longer hold me, I "transition" to becoming the narrator for the human race.

they're the first narrators now setting it all up, and it'll remain functioning as a reflection of my perception for as long as I'm around. I get excluded from all of that, but then later, they sort of pass it off to me, which is kinda cool.

it's also kinda fun to think about this from an evolution-of-desire sort of perspective because so many people *thought* that they needed or wanted to have me for some reason, but then at the very end, it's not really a problem because I am becoming them and they are becoming me. there's actually no escaping it, and I feel extremely at "peace" with it all. I no longer have to worry about anything...

---

I can hear the reactions already wondering what in the world that means -- and because it appears that you all are being setup to be inside of a sort of astral dream reality that "they" control, "they" become me soon, so I'll project down into time and space and interact just like I always do. I can take on any form or be anything that I want. I guess that will be the 2nd ray (the new "source") perspective -- and just as we die, go to source, and then jump back into bodies to live out our narrative experience in the organism, it's certain that this is the "great attractor at the end of time" (destiny) for everyone (meaning, you can't miss it).

the other reaction is wondering what about the journey along the way -- and you know me -- I'm not much for conditions, because they end up coming back to haunt me. I want to do something because *I* did it, -- not because I had the nike pumps, or the best gaming console, best tech, or some other silly thing like that. I focused, and I was chilled out about it and I made it all the way to the manifestation because *I AM*; I didn't need anything, or want anything. I AM. so, prolly not...
