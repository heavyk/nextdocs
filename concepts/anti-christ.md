anti-christ

I define the anti-christ as someone who is not willing to "save" another person.

usually saving someone from something involves some sort of exchange. I'll save you in exchange for something (a favour, sex, money, power, etc) -- and this is mutual-back-scratching.

a person that needs to be saved also has low self-esteem and and thinks theirself incapable of performing whatever they need to be saved from.

an anti-christ will not try to perpetuate a person's low self-esteem or a belief in incapability (even if there is a mutually beneficial exchange).

an anti-christ is much more like source where they *know* that you're capable of accomplishing it and it's only your belief that prevents you from it. the only person stopping you from saving yourself is you.

saving someone also has the focus on the problem, when an anti-christ will be focused on solutions. you can't save someone if they're improving -- only if they're getting worse.

saving someone also removes the liberty from someone to find their own way out of their problem and says, I'll do it for you and we're going to do it my way.

none of these are anything that I want to have anything to do with. I enjoy finding my own way and figuring it out for myself. I prefer to look at people and know that they can find a way to feel the way that they want, and don't need someone or something to save them from the way that they feel.

also, notice how what people think they want to be saved from are the conditions, but even if the conditions change, they need to be saved again, and again. people who need saving usually need a continual stream of saviours.

the reason for this is that the condition isn't what they want to be saved from -- they really want to be saved from the feeling they have on the inside and they think a change in conditions will improve the feeling.

I assume you that nobody and no thing will ever be able to change the way you feel. that's a complete violation of liberty. *only you* can decide how you want to feel in whatever situation. nobody can ever force you to feel a certain way.

sure, really awful conditons (like being nailed to a cross) can cause a person to feel bad, but they don't have to. you can choose to feel any way you choose no matter the conditions.

an anti-christ will make no effort to try and improve the way a person feels for them, but instead believe in the person, knowing that they can do it for theirselves.

an anti-christ is all about emotional and conceptual self-empowerment, because that's what creates reality
