# the-manual

manual for "how the universe works" (final edition, until the next solar regime), where every (3rd ray) symbolic system is a subset of the frequency emitted by the sun -- the literal stuff that our solar system is made out of. it's probably impossible to fully replicate such a complex frequency emitted by the sun, a sort of "protocol" for how energy can be input and output to the system. it's like a great computer with infinite processing power that powers all concepts.

obviously concepts are eternal; like our sun is. it takes a lot of effort to kill a star, so you can basically consider the sun *the* most powerful computer we have access to. the-manual is how you do it.
