# they-speak

this is a new sentence structure that doesn't need to involve genders.

when you wish to hide the gender of the person that you're talking about never refer to them in the descriptive way, but *only* in the possessive (genitive) case.

bad:
- they are an engineer

good:
- that's theirs

[TODO: probably add a few more examples]

the hard part about this form of speech is that if you want to hide their gender, you can never describe them.

so, for example if the person is really beautiful, you describe the things that are "theirs" but never "them"
