this is a concept I developed by accident. the idea is that if I can fee good about what I'm complaining about, then it's fine.

the idea comes that some things will never be fine. there's no way to feel good about something like someone committing suicide in front of you or something. so, instead of trying to figure out how to feel good about that, recognise the problem and even complain about it a little bit, but at negate that by noticing an improvement at the same time -- like maybe, "he definitely feels better now than he did. it's nlt worth it to live a life in misery".

there are other ways to feel good about a problem as well, and the most obvious is to find a way to no longer see it as a problem. turn it into something interesting, something unusual, something extrordinary, or most easy -- as part of a larger process.
