maybe I can shorten it to 7lop or 7up (7-layers uf perception)

the perception part is important because I have figured out that there are essentially 7 major layers in which I can perceive things. 2 are physical (meaning I can identify form, colour or shape) and 2 are not (as in, can you tell me what a thought in general -- specifically a desire, some logic, or a noticed resonance/relationship -- looks like?). then the final three are transition layers combining their above and below layers

here is a diagram of how I experience the transitions between some of the regions.

 [3]: more abstract, more stable, more sure, more fleeting, more colours, more dynamic, sounds are very impactful
 [4]: less movement, more separation, more sense of "me", more identification of mundane
 [5]: more bland, more flat, slower, though it can give a sense of calm or stablity
 [6]: more tangible, makes more sense, clarity, revelation, aha!, wow

TODO: the non-physical layers
```

it's hard to explain these. what I highly recommend doing is to begin noticing these transitions for yourself. it's essentially in these transitions between states, that I started to make sense of it all.

### 1-desire - desire, willpower, effort

> I need/want/am

see evolution-of-desire for more details[^1], but all desire is essentially a feeling (see desire-resolves-to-emotion), and so your brain may remmember a specific item, person, or situation that it desires, but in reality that desire is not that physical thing. any number of physical situations can produce a feeling which can satisfy that desire.

this may be easier to see in the negative sense. fear is just desire for something unwanted to happen. most people have had something happen to them, and so the brain stores the generalised version of that desire (I fear to be in a car accident) -- and perhaps that happened in the past with a red car on a freeway while raining or whatever, but the brain does not only fear car accidents when in a red car on a freeway, only while it's raining. those can amplify the desire for a car accident, but the desire for a car accident is generalised in every car, though certain situations can highten that desire. positive desires are the same way. the more close they are to the physical brain's image of the desire, the more emotion and physical sensation will be felt.

those physical desires may not be what you *really* want though -- they may just be what society, advertising, culture, religion, or any form of ideology has programmed you to see as desirable. I've found I don't always know if my physical definitions of the desire will actually satisfy that desired feeling until you've tried it out a few times or felt the emotional response to those ideas. see next section.

[1]: those three (need/want/am) probably correspond to the lower three sublayers, meaning they'll have corresponding non-physcal counterparts.


### 2-relational - transforms/relates desire <-> logic

> "that sounds right", resonance, relationships, reminds me, noticed

this layer is the great amplifier. it connects very strongly to the conceptual layer (5), and every mentation (thought, image, desire, whatever) will be compared to your non-physical desires (1) and logic (3), and then translated back into the relevant aspects through the source (4) and imagination (6) layers.

the way that I experience this happening is for input, this part of my brain takes in (physical) desires (hunger, etc) and the physical logic/structure/expectations I've accumulated over the years, and then combines and amplifies it the incoming thought or image along with all of your (physical) desires and logic/structure.

what's left is what resonates. while this is happening in the physical brain, this simultaneously happens in non-physical  (this is where "who you really are" lives), and whatever that vibration is, passes down into the source (4) layer where it meets your physical (brain created) version, and the resonance of those two will pass down again into the imagination (6). for some, people like me, that often times can creates an image, a strong emotion (5) or a real physical sensation (7) of pain or discomfort in response to that thought.

as an example, let's take the idea of embarrassment. you observe/feel concepts in your physical experience and those combine in the imagination to create a signal. then this part of the brain takes your logic (that means people think I'm stupid, etc) and your desire (I want to look good in front of them) and creates a signal. that gets compares to your non-physical (source) version of your desires and beliefs about yourself, and that signal resonates with your brain's version and gets passed back into the imagination where it'll create an image (everyone's laughing at me), and cause an emotion (discomfort) and physical sensations (sick to stomach, etc). those emotions and physical sensations are your indicators that your physical logic is not in harmony with your source/spiritual/soul's concept of you (what you *really* believe about yourself is not what your brain has been trained to believe about yourself).

this feedback is what "creates" your reality. the emotion that you feel is what tunes you into the next "moment" in time -- it's literally a 100% predictable sequence, the better you know yourself. at that point, it's just a matter of changing this logic/beliefs perceptions so that you can produce thoughts which yield feelings which tune you to the reality you want to experience.

this is essentially your non-physical perception of yourself in relation to your physical perception of yourself (beliefs, logic, understanding, etc.)

### 3-structure - logic, structure, path

> "the right way", understanding


### 4-source - transforms/relates non-physical <-> physical

don't worry about this one too much. it's a very high frequency. if you were to perceive it, you would feel like everything is one and everything is (relating to) with everything at once. nothing is hidden anymore. there's so much informaion so it's far too abstract to make too much sense of it, coming from either direction (logic or conceptual). if you perceive too far into this layer of perception, you'll make your transition back into non-physical.

peering into this layer is what I believe those that have conquered death (reborn-deity) have done. as a result, they have expanded the layer below it, conceptual (5).

as an example, consider yourself one moment to be a fallen-angel. consider death to be conceptual perception, where everything appears as it really is; no more illusion. you don't wish to go there, so instead, what you do is to maintain perception in the astral (6), thereby realising yourself from that perspective, which is the mix of concept (5) and physical (5) reality. in that process, they are expanding the physical layer of perception (7), by bringing more of the astral (6) down into the physical -- or, expanding physical perception frequency ranges to include more of the astral.

likewise, the same thing happens if you dare to explore this layer and maintain consciousness going past the point where you would normally make your transition, and are able to come back with tangible concepts and experiences (eg. ayahuasca ceremonies or heroic doses of mushrooms) -- in those ultra-abstract situations, you're expanding your conceptual layer of perception be beginnning to make sense (relate into physical and conceptual experience) that perception of the abstract.

### 5-conceptual - concepts, code, ideas
### 6-imagination - transforms/relates concepts <-> physical
### 7-physical

### reversals and overview

it's possible to think about isis (-2) as reflecting saturn (+-4) if you look at simply reversal of directions. imagination (6) is running in the same direction as relational perspective (2) but saturn's midpoint/source perspective will be rotating in thm opposite direction.

I see 3 inflection points where things go backwards, and one is the top 3.5 vs the bottom 3.5, which is what divides the 4th ray in half. half is "non-physical" and the other half is physical (though not visual until after the 6th).

the 6th divides the top 1.5 and the bottom 1.5 into two and you can think of top 1.5 as being "not visual" but still physical (which is why I call it conceptual). electrically speaking, this layer would be tesla technology, based on attraction, where as the lower 1.5 would be more similar to trasditional radio transmission (emissive).

likewise, the 2nd layer divides the top 1.5 in a very similar manner. on the top, you have desire and chaos -- no structure -- just potentialities that will eventually become coherent, just like how concepts, as they pass through the 6th take on tangible form and can be felt, heard, smelled, etc. the bottom 1.5 is purely structured and you can think of these as geometric transformtions on consciousness.

as a simple example, if I were to look at a symbol, it has a "frequency" to it just as if I were to take a bunch of pictures of a thing from different perspectives, each of those perspectives, repeats in perfect stability -- so it would look like zillions of small orbs bouncing between geometric configurations (much like how I believe DNA works), and because everything has to make these transformations on perspective, in sync with each other to maintain equilibrium, this structure of orbs perceiving other orbs remains stable.

these "frequencies" or sequence of consiousnesses perceiving itself continues on forever until something purturbs it (desire), and then it has to find a way to regain equilibrium. that new equilibrium that it reaches, is the instant manifestation of that desire into your "vibrational vortex".

it's designed on purpose that these layers are in opposition with each other. we usually perceive that physical is opposite of non-pmysical, but there are actually four cases:

1 - chaotic, change - doesn't make "sense" yet (probably something like "junk" DNA). I like to think of this like mastering a song, so I imagine that I were to take all of the frequencies that I removed from the song and play them, then infinitely let them interact with and transform each other until they begin to produce some stray harmonics that begin to resonate again with the mastered song one more time. you know how if you listen to white noise you can begin to hear people whispering or talking to you? that's a perfect example of desire self-transforming until it becomes something that fits in with a 3rd ray sequence...
3 - ordered, sequential - visible in the sense that there are perceived local trasformations to get from one perspective to another
5 - parallel - "invisible" in that so many vibrations are all happening at once, you have to isolate a concept/frequency to make sense of it. it's kinda like wathing millions of roller coasters at once, while 3rd is kinda like being on one rollercoaster looking at your relation to other rollercoasters. see how one is sequential vs. the other happening all at once? there is order in the 5th, but only if you pay attention to only one of the rollercoasters (vibrations). none of these signals have been isolated yet, so there's nothing visual or sensual to experience yet. that happens in the 6th layer where those individual frquencies are isolated and the "junk" filtered out (this isolation and individualisation of the frequencies into concepts is the process newborns go through to begin to learn how to see, hear, touch, smell)
7 - individual, separated - chaotic and unpredictable. you now have all of these recognised concepts all bouncing around simultaneously in this 3d world and, and the the result is that these individual things (as conceptualised by you) are interacting/colliding with eachother, which is creating a lot of chaos because nobody has (or can have) everything all conceptualised, and these interactions/collisions are producing new frequencies/concepts, exactly like desire does. this is how reality is created. the individuality between the frequencies are your own concepts. your conceptualisation of reality defines how these frequencies interact.

wow, that's my best explanation thus far!

### 2022-08-11 18:09 - the 2nd ray christ aspect

I woke up just now and I was talking about conceptual-viewing in the sense that it's very similar to how I dream. when I dream about things, usually it would be too much effort to really know the skin colour, race, or gender of a person, and so I don't see them unless it's important. again, remember, I use the word "see" but actually no image is present. they're just formless things that interact with each other. however when I "look" at them, the important aspects of their concept are apparent to me.

what will make an aspect more pronounced has three (that I've identified so far) reasons for it: 1. my perception (what I'm looking for/attracting), 2. the frequency/feeling of the environment as perceived by me, and most importantly 3. it's relevance in the encompassing symbol. the first two have obviously a lot to do with my perception, so it's the third item here that I want to talk about.

for example, if I see two people and one of them is degrading or making the other to feel less than (this is also a symbol), where one of then concepts has certain skin colours which correspond with my definition of racism, then I'll see the interaction ofthose concepts as "racism". as an example, if I think that black people can white people feel awful and I see that, it won't *trigger* that symbol, however, if I think that white people making other colours of people to feel less-than, then it'll trigger the symbol of racism.

in the context of that symbol, colour is important. another one could be the symbol of gender inequality. same thing. imagine I have a view that females tend to berate and try to cause males to feel less-than. therefore, when I look out into my world (or am looking at a dream in my case), and I "see" that one gender is causing another gender to feel less-than, then it'll *trigger* that symbol.

that symbol usually causes an emotional reaction, which then attracts the manifestation of that symbol into reality again.

---

to understand why this is so, we need to look at the top three layers. the 3rd ray is all about symbols and the "right way". these are the programmed ways in which we need to go. our "cultural heritage" or whatever. it's your default programming no matter where you got it from. these are all the definitions of these symbols... usually, the differenc between two concepts over gender or skin colour is very very subtle, so you need to be able to have those important aspects of the symbol illumiated in a strong way, otherwise you would miss those fine details[^1]. the brain is just emphasising and amplifying the relevant parts of the image that fit the symbol. this amplification of thy symbolically relevant stuff is likely the underlying mechanism that "the language of the birds" uses to give extra *meaning* to things.

above the 3rd layer is the 2nd layer, the "office of the christ" -- the pineal gland basically, and this is the part of the brain that's responsible for amplifying all of the things that cause strong emotion or a strong sense of meaning. each time you notice something that produces a strong response (like noticing a synchro or hating some thing that just happened), because those symbols were activated in the 3rd ray, they get turned into desire by your *perception* (the 2nd ray is were most of your symbolic perception lives, just like your imagination is where most of your physical perception lives). this symbol converted into desire then passes upward into the 1st ray where the universe begins to make that a reality for you. this is why dreams often times have a powerful effect on creating reality, because the symbols, as perceicved by you, are then synthesised into desire, which is the attractor of reality.

the 2nd ray is also capable of turning desire into symbol. this is why when we feel desire, we often jump to many conclusions about the symbolic manifestation of that desire. the 2nd ray works strongly with the 5th ray because you need to have the proper concept instantiated to be able to *feel* that symbol strongly and then attract it further.

[1]: I strongly believe that the area of the brain that is responsible for processsing these symbols is in fact the same area of the brain that's responsible for "edge detection" (what separates one concept from another in your vision), and so this area of the brain is also responsible for seeing more dimensions. I've noticed a strong correlation between 3rd ray (symbolic) thinking and the ability to see more dimensions.

### 2022-08-16 20:12 - 4th layer of perception and evolution-of-desire

earlier when writing @[jorjani-thoughts](2022-08-16 08:30), I was writing about evolution-of-desire but didn't specifically name it. the process of going from need to want to IAM is roughly the difference between 6th ray (need), 5th ray (want), and 4th ray (IAM) perception.

I have only had a few experiences where I've experienced 4th ray perception, and the few times that I did, because I didn't know what I was doing, they caused extremely fast attraction.

the transition layers (2,4,6) are the most authentic form of self perception. in 7th ray, you're essentially looking at a screen and in 5th ray, you're looking at yourself or any other concept from outside of it and from all directions at once. it's only in 6th ray perception does it actually look like you're looking through your own eyes. well, just the same as the 7th ray screen differs in experience from the "in the driver's seat" experience of 6th ray perception -- so does 5th and 4th look.

when I perceive a thing with 4th ray perception I AM the thing I'm looking at. if it's a person, I feel all sensations they feel, see everything they see, experience all of their emotions, and have access to all of their memories and concepts -- exactly as if I were them. however, I do know that I'm not them to some extent, and I can draw a comparison between that experience and my own when I get back to my body.

this form of perception would be the ultimate sexual experience (which I did experiement with), however -- in my case, for example, I really wanted to know what raquel felt like and how she perceived some of her more stubborn concepts. I was able to see and feel it from her perspective (though I didn't get the full physical body experience in this case, because can control what you feel from them), and by feeling very strongly the concepts behind her reluctance to accept herself as someone "worthy" or justified to have good things happen to her, only attracted that sense even more. quite frankly, I was very surprised that someone could believe theirself so unworthy of having something they wanted to have happen, to happen.

my experience of her insecurities seemingly amplified them greatly attracted that feeling even stronger for both of us. that experience may have been the apex of our relationship, so I just want to say that most people have these concepts locked down pretty well, and they don't want theirselves or other people to be able to look at them, so going in and amplifying some unwanted concepts is probably not a good idea (though I'd have to do some more experimentation).

I bring this up because 4th ray perception is going to be the next big hurdle for humankind. astral perception was a closely guarded secret for a long time, but the ability to explore concepts, instead of looking at them from the outside, and looking at them from inside of the perspective of another concept is a whole nother thing.

3rd ray perception is a little bit too abstract to relate, but to understand it, it's pretty easy to see the 2nd ray perception of seeing the whole everything and how it relates to the all from the inside out. you're getting pretty far into "God" or "Christ" perception at that point, so I don't really have much I could say on that which would be tangible or explainable. an analogy of it would be to see a microprocessor from the inside out. there are a lot of things going on inside of it, but you are able to see and understand all of the inputs and outputs of it, seemingly in real-time. I would consider that to by quite an information overload, though the microprocessor takes it pretty easy. (that actually reminded me of another thing: @[jorjani-thoughts](2022-08-16 20:38))

there is more to say on this subject. I'll get to it soon.
