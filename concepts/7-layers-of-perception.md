maybe I can shorten it to 7lop or 7up (7-layers uf perception)

the perception part is important because I have figured out that there are essentially 7 major layers in which I can perceive things. 2 are physical (meaning I can identify form, colour or shape) and 2 are not (as in, can you tell me what a thought in general -- specifically a desire, some logic, or a noticed resonance/relationship -- looks like?). then the final three are transition layers combining their above and below layers

### the transition layers

here is a diagram of how I experience the transitions between some of the regions.

 [l]: more significant, more vibrant, higher frequency, more movement
 [2]: more real, more tangible, more volumetric
 [3]: more abstract, more stable, more sure, more fleeting, more colours, more dynamic, sounds are very impactful
 [4]: less movement, more separation, more sense of "me", more identification of mundane
 [5]: more bland, more flat, slower, though it can give a sense of calm or stablity
 [6]: more tangible, makes more sense, clarity, revelation, aha!, wow

TODO: the non-physical layers
```

it's hard to explain these. what I highly recommend doing is to begin noticing these transitions for yourself. it's essentially in these transitions between states, that I started to make sense of it all.

### 1-desire - desire, willpower, effort

> I need/want/am

see evolution-of-desire for more details[^1], but all desire is essentially a feeling (see desire-resolves-to-emotion), and so your brain may remmember a specific item, person, or situation that it desires, but in reality that desire is not that physical thing. any number of physical situations can produce a feeling which can satisfy that desire.

this may be easier to see in the negative sense. fear is just desire for something unwanted to happen. most people have had something happen to them, and so the brain stores the generalised version of that desire (I fear to be in a car accident) -- and perhaps that happened in the past with a red car on a freeway while raining or whatever, but the brain does not only fear car accidents when in a red car on a freeway, only while it's raining. those can amplify the desire for a car accident, but the desire for a car accident is generalised in every car, though certain situations can highten that desire. positive desires are the same way. the more close they are to the physical brain's image of the desire, the more emotion and physical sensation will be felt.

those physical desires may not be what you *really* want though -- they may just be what society, advertising, culture, religion, or any form of ideology has programmed you to see as desirable. I've found I don't always know if my physical definitions of the desire will actually satisfy that desired feeling until you've tried it out a few times or felt the emotional response to those ideas. see next section.

[1]: those three (need/want/am) probably correspond to the lower three sublayers, meaning they'll have corresponding non-physcal counterparts.


### 2-relational - transforms/relates desire <-> logic

> "that sounds right", resonance, relationships, reminds me, noticed

this layer is the great amplifier. it connects very strongly to the conceptual layer (5), and every mentation (thought, image, desire, whatever) will be compared to your non-physical desires (1) and logic (3), and then translated back into the relevant aspects through the source (4) and imagination (6) layers.

the way that I experience this happening is for input, this part of my brain takes in (physical) desires (hunger, etc) and the physical logic/structure/expectations I've accumulated over the years, and then combines and amplifies it the incoming thought or image along with all of your (physical) desires and logic/structure.

what's left is what resonates. while this is happening in the physical brain, this simultaneously happens in non-physical  (this is where "who you really are" lives), and whatever that vibration is, passes down into the source (4) layer where it meets your physical (brain created) version, and the resonance of those two will pass down again into the imagination (6). for some, people like me, that often times can creates an image, a strong emotion (5) or a real physical sensation (7) of pain or discomfort in response to that thought.

as an example, let's take the idea of embarrassment. you observe/feel concepts in your physical experience and those combine in the imagination to create a signal. then this part of the brain takes your logic (that means people think I'm stupid, etc) and your desire (I want to look good in front of them) and creates a signal. that gets compares to your non-physical (source) version of your desires and beliefs about yourself, and that signal resonates with your brain's version and gets passed back into the imagination where it'll create an image (everyone's laughing at me), and cause an emotion (discomfort) and physical sensations (sick to stomach, etc). those emotions and physical sensations are your indicators that your physical logic is not in harmony with your source/spiritual/soul's concept of you (what you *really* believe about yourself is not what your brain has been trained to believe about yourself).

this feedback is what "creates" your reality. the emotion that you feel is what tunes you into the next "moment" in time -- it's literally a 100% predictable sequence, the better you know yourself. at that point, it's just a matter of changing this logic/beliefs perceptions so that you can produce thoughts which yield feelings which tune you to the reality you want to experience.

this is essentially your non-physical perception of yourself in relation to your physical perception of yourself (beliefs, logic, understanding, etc.)

### 3-structure - logic, structure, path

> "the right way", understanding


### 4-source - transforms/relates non-physical <-> physical

don't worry about this one too much. it's a very high frequency. if you were to perceive it, you would feel like everything is one and everything is (relating to) with everything at once. nothing is hidden anymore. there's so much informaion so it's far too abstract to make too much sense of it, coming from either direction (logic or conceptual). if you perceive too far into this layer of perception, you'll make your transition back into non-physical.

peering into this layer is what I believe those that have conquered death (reborn-deity) have done. as a result, they have expanded the layer below it, conceptual (5).

as an example, consider yourself one moment to be a fallen-angel. consider death to be conceptual perception, where everything appears as it really is; no more illusion. you don't wish to go there, so instead, what you do is to maintain perception in the astral (6), thereby realising yourself from that perspective, which is the mix of concept (5) and physical (5) reality. in that process, they are expanding the physical layer of perception (7), by bringing more of the astral (6) down into the physical -- or, expanding physical perception frequency ranges to include more of the astral.

likewise, the same thing happens if you dare to explore this layer and maintain consciousness going past the point where you would normally make your transition, and are able to come back with tangible concepts and experiences (eg. ayahuasca ceremonies or heroic doses of mushrooms) -- in those ultra-abstract situations, you're expanding your conceptual layer of perception be beginnning to make sense (relate into physical and conceptual experience) that perception of the abstract.

### 5-conceptual - concepts, code, ideas
### 6-imagination - transforms/relates concepts <-> physical
### 7-physical
