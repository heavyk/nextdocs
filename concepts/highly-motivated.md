I approach life from a perspective of doing things that I want to do. however, along the way through life I've learned how to be highly-motivated, which is to do things because if I don't, there's an unwanted consequence. so in order to prevent the unwanted consequence from happening, I feel motivation to do something.

so, in that sense, there are three basic states, but I contend that the neutral state doesn't really exist: doing things that I want to do, and doing things that I don't want to do; the neutral case, for me (and it may be different for others) is where I don't have a strong opinion one way or another about the action. it's sorta like breathing or moving, but you can see even those have desire (to breath) or undesire (to move).

usually highly-motivated people have a whole bunch of things that they *have* to do, but I will invariably find them escaping the things that they have to do, by doing something they want to do, whether that's smoking weed, drinking, or a facebook game. I've found that most "addicts" are highly-motivated people. the addict part is just the guilt trip associated with not doing the things that you *have* to do, and so therefore the looming consequence only compounds the problem with the guilt associated with doing something that you want to do.

the other thing I've noticed about highly-motivated people are motivated by at least one of three images: how they see theirself, how others see them, or some ideal "golden age" utopian conditions. this image is often the factor which makes the things they "have to do" the things that they "have to do"...

"if I don't do this, I'll break my promise to myself"
"if I don't do this, others will think I'm ..."
"if I don't do this, I'm a failure"
"if I don't do this, I will hate myself"

... and so this image often becomes a sort of delusion or fantasy that begins to take the place of reality.
