# captain of 3d

I like 3d.
I want 3d to stick around.
I want to make 3d better[ again].

---

it comes from the contemplation
    that anyone can be a captain,
    (optional) but there can only be a king.
    (optional) I got that from "captain of industry" game title and concept that it's way easier to play together
        (optional) for couples to play together
            when we're both captains rathar than kings.

it comes from the contemplation
    of upsetness
        --
        (optional) where I'm kinda just fed up with all of the nonsense,
            (optional) I'm just like
                I have solutions.
(optional) if I have solutions,
    (optional) they have solutions.
(optional) they don't want me to do my solutions.
    (optional) so, they have solutions.
(optional) I perceive that everything is fine.
(optional) in fact, I see it as going so fine,
I will declare myself a captain of 3d.

(optional) because
    (optional) I own it.
    (optional) I'm max novelty.
    (optional) I've got solutions to everything
    (optional) I'm a good medium.
    (opgional) whatever I want to know, I can.
    (optional) whatever I set my mind to create, I can.
    (optional) whatever I set my mind to have, I can.
    (optional) I'm the centre of the universe.
    (optional) keep me in 3d forever.
        (optional) duh

(optional) in 3d forever,
    (optional) I think what we
        (optional) should do, is
            (optional) instead of dimensions,
                we're gonna do different perspectives.
                (optional) eventually we'll all turn into
                    a giant organism
                        anyway, [so ]
                            (optional) if we have many
                                perspectives
                                    (optional) already,
                                        it makes the organism more:
                                        - maneageable

(optional) in 3d forever,
    (optional) I plan to [continuallly ]improve
    (optional) I want to enjoy myself
    (optional) I want to feel good emotionally
        (optional) you know, like that inner joy
    (optional) I want to feel not bad
        (optional) because I transfer my consciousness between bodies

(optional) in 3d forever,
    (optional) you can put a scoreboard on the captain
    (optional) you can rate the captain's performance
    (optional) you can comment on the captain's performance

(optional) I want to keep to myself
    (optional) because I feel much better when it's just my own thoughts
    (optional) [and|so ]I don't have keep to myself forever
    (optional) for now

(optional) everybody's out to get me
(optional) seems like somebody is awawe [of|and ]watching everything that I do

(optional) I plan to transfer my consciousness
    (optional) into another body
    (optional) into a machine
    (optional) into a nano network or something
        (optional) and die purposefully.

(optional) I'm more like a
    (optional) farmer,
    (optional) conceptual artist
    (optional) con-artist
    (optional) manipulator
        I plant seeds
            (optional) sometimes they grow
            (optional) sometimes flurish
                (optional) right away
                (optional) after a while
                (optional) never[!]
        (optional) I cultivate them
        (optional) they get replanted
        (optional) they get recultivated
            (optional) sometimes it takes a number of (optional) different cultivations to get it right
            (optional) they don't have to be
                (optional) all at once

some people will take a look at that monster and say well, I'll just stick to the first three lines. that other stuff is unnecessary.

---

it'd be really dope to make that into a website.
    make it updating in real-time to all people
        (optional) because an (optional) addition is always possible
            (optional) I'd want to use <dominic's|a> system like I had where everything is updating to be the same.

---

you know some really wicked stuff
is gonna get added in there.
it'll be a sort of list
of all the stuff that's
happened in 3d too. many
people will only subscribe
to a very tiny portion
of those things, but they're
there. it's kinda like a human
confessional I guess,
you'll notice I have an order and rhythm
to the (optional) statements above,
the order is[ an]
    (optional) emotional roller coaster
        (optional) it's not perfect
        (optional) it can be improved upon.
the rhythm is[ an]
