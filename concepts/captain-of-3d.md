# captain of 3d

I like 3d. I want 3d to stick around. I want to make 3d better (again?).

---

it comes from the contemplation that anyone can be a captain, but there can only be a king. I got that from "captain of industry" game title and concept that it's way easier for couples to play together when you're both captains rathar than kings.
