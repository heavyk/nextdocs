# captain of 3d

I like 3d. I want 3d to stick around. I want to make 3d better (again?).

---

it comes from the contemplation that anyone can be a captain, but there can only be a king. I got that from "captain of industry" game title and concept that it's way easier for couples to play together when you're both captains rathar than kings.

it comes from the contemplation of upsetness -- where I'm kinda just fed up with all of the nonsense, I'm just like I have solutions. if I have solutions, they have solutions. they don't want me to do it so the have solutions. I perceive that everything is fine. in fact, I see it as going so fine, I will declare myself a captain of 3d.

(optional) I own it.
(optional) I'm max novelty.
(optional) I've got solutions to everything
(optional) because I'm a good medium.
(opgional) whatever I want to know, I can.
(optional) whatever I set my mind to create, I can.
(optional) whatever I set my mind to have, I can.
