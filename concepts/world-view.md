the way that a person constructs their world.

it's an agreed upon reality and is constructed and affected by others in your aura.

it's the reason why the same people in different geography can have cultures with different world-views.

world-view = culture + perception of people around nearby + the individual's perception

a person's perception is emitted outward from them, much like a sun and the heliopause. everything vibrates with that perception. I'm pretty sure it's magnetic in nature.
