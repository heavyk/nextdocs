this is the perspective of "one". you are you, but you are composed of many other things.

from the perspective of earth, it is "one planet" -- yet that planet has zillions of other "ones" on it too. some of those ones will leave the planet and never come back too. surely they are not the planet, because sometimes they're not there.

the planet though without those ones would not be the same. this is also true for a human and their gut bacteria and other "foreign" organisms. surely these organisms are not the human, but the human would be very different without those organisms. another human can have or be given those same organisms too.

you are many, but you perceive yourself as one -- different from the other ones.
