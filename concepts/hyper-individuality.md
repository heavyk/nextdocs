# hyper-individuality

I experience this regularly, probably because I see everything so uniquely my way, that I just don't really think that anyone else will be able to see it quite like I do and to replicate what I would do.

for me, this manifests as a strong desire to just let other people be the way they are.
I don't want to upset them.
like, when I walk through the room and someone is sleeping,
I go silent, because I don't want to be in their way or to break them away from their state.

I'd rathar be by myself than to be disturbing someone else.

I'd really rather do things my way, than to have to collaborate with others
I'm the only one who could do it right anyway

in general, because I'm this way, this form of thought manifests to a lot of people as massive ego, and -- the reality is that I do like myself and that's precisely why I find myself to be the only person that can really do the task properly. this is the 2nd ray persspective at its peak.

because the feminine side knows that I'll always make it no matter what (it kinda sees me as invincible), this creates a number of different safety situations in most people's feminine sides, because they do not actually believe theirselves to be invincible, so they need to come up with safety measures to account for this fearlessness (this is learned as a child, probably passed by default from the mother and by instruction/presence by the father, but I'm not sure).

so, for example, I had a brain haemorrhage and so because of it I had to develop this side of me where I knew I was going to be OK. as in, I could feel it, but my body didn't know it (manifests as shaking), I had to find a way to recode how my body thinks of the same thing. it's nearly impossible to try and code for all situations (alcohol, concepts, certain feeling guys, etc) so instead, what I did is make my default, "I'll totally be fine" "I'm basically invincible" "I choose when I want to die" sort of statements. this defsult coding allowed me to get into some situations that allowed me to ensure the new feature is "battle hardened".

because I know I'll always be fine, I worry for other people.
if I'm around others, I'm not 100% sure they'll always be fine,
though I know I'll make it out OK.
