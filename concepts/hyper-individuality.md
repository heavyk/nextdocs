# hyper-individuality

I experience this regularly, probably because I see everything so uniquely my way, that I just don't really think that anyone else will be able to see it quite like I do and to replicate what I would do.

for me, this manifests as a strong desire to just let other people be the way they are.
I don't want to upset them.
like, when I walk through the room and someone is sleeping,
I go silent, because I don't want to be in their way or to break them away from their state.

I'd rathar be by myself than to be disturbing someone else.

I'd really rather do things my way, than to have to collaborate with others
I'm the only one who could do it right anyway

I AM empathetic, and I don't want to feel what others (or the group) feels, so I usually prefer how I feel instead.

---

in general, because I'm this way, this form of thought manifests to a lot of people as massive ego, and -- the reality is that I do like myself and that's precisely why I find myself to be the only person that can really do the task properly. this is the 2nd ray persspective at its peak.

because the feminine side knows that I'll always make it no matter what (it kinda sees me as invincible), this creates a number of different safety situations in most people's feminine sides, because they do not actually believe theirselves to be invincible, so they need to come up with safety measures to account for this fearlessness (this is learned as a child, probably passed by default from the mother and by instruction/presence by the father, but I'm not sure).

so, for example, I had a brain haemorrhage and so because of it I had to develop this side of me where I knew I was going to be OK. as in, I could feel it[^1], but my body didn't know it (manifests as shaking[^2]), I had to find a way to recode how my body thinks of the same thing. it's nearly impossible to try and code for all situations (alcohol, concepts, certain feeling guys, etc) so instead, what I did is make my default, "I'll totally be fine" "I'm basically invincible" "I choose when I want to die" sort of statements. this defsult coding allowed me to get into some situations that allowed me to ensure the new feature is "battle hardened".

because I know I'll always be fine, I worry for other people.
if I'm around others, I'm not 100% sure they'll always be fine,
though I know, *I'll* make it out OK.

[1]: a long time ago I listened to an e-book called "project superman" and there was this thing where this guy (andy) gets thrown out of jets and all sorts of crazy stuff (though I don't remember any large ruptures of skin like getting shot in the face), but he always just went to this place and just waited for his body to repair. it describes all this visual imagery, but it's a trap to think it's the imagery that does it. he's looking at images in his mind's eye as a reflection of his own belief that he'll be fine; just gatta wait it out. it's his perception that made him invincible and returned his body back to being fine, not the visuals... anyway, when I read it, the thing that I caught, was, cause you know how I tune into people -- and his concept was pretty loud (kinda like jesus, where it's hard to say what's "real" because there's so much thought and belief baggage). when expriencing his concept, I noticed that he *felt* like he was invincible and that reminded me a lot of when I was a kid. I *felt* invincible. if something happened, I could always make it back (usually with proof that I had a difficult time).

[2]: this is when my core system (the core of my thought) knows that I'll be fine, but my physical brain and body hasn't yet been trained or adequately gotten used to this core concept. it's my body that still thinks that there is a risk or a danger, but as an ego separate from my body, those things don't *really* cause me to shake; that's just my unlearned automaton (or half of it anyway) that hasn't quite figured out how to feel that calm in the physical. you know, when I'm connected, I move strangely. it's very relaxed and effortless feeling (dunno what it looks like to you guys, though). it's just my physical body that's not quite ready for the situation. this is always the case when I jump and get really startled when seeing a person that just was tuned in to nosebook. it causes a physical feeling like I've just really entered into a turbulant zone. this happened today with greg. same thing. I'm just not quite ready yet, so I still have massive jumps in significant changes in frequency.
