(scroll to the bottom for the actual concept)

I gave a lot of thought to the many stone boxes strewn all around the world, but most notably in egypt with the best ones preserved in the serapium. a while ago, matt from "ancient architects" [TODO: link to video] did a while ago that showed that a mix of animal meat and a yeast will produce massive amounts of CO2 for an extended period of time. this explains the black soot and also the cow bones (without mumification) and potentially the gross sewer liquid too.

in the video, the guy shows how if the pressure of the expansion of the CO2 keeps rising, it'll exert a force on the granite causing the air around it to "ionise" and become charged.

that explains the stacks of heavy objects that were seen piled up on top of the boxes when they were first discovered: to keep more pressure in. the lid will work like a pressure release valve, so when the pressure is heavier than the lid, a little bit of the gas will escape -- so, adding more weight will allow for higher pressures, and therefore greater ionisation in the surounding area.

what it doesn't explain is the precision manufacturing and precision right-angles the interiors of the boxes have. to my knowledge, there aren't any boxes with rounded edges, so it seems that the boxes were designed to be resonating chambers amplifying and transforming certain frequencies into others. the resonant frequencies of the boxes has been documented and studied to some extent, but until it's done with high pressure CO2, I don't know that the answers will reflect the original intent. they clearly wanted to amplify certain frequencies and not others.

---

so, putting these items together, what that means is that with the box closed and expanding CO2 on the inside, you will get a vibrating ionisation pattern. the high pressure is to ensure enough molecular collisions to ensure that high frequency harmonics are created, and I think that's what they were after. the "scoop marks" on the outside of some and different densities of the material for others show that they were very carefully tuned.

I believe that the ionisation process produces H+ ions (protons) which will vibrate at the frequency of the upper harmonics of the boxes. this frequency, I believe was tuned to the frequency of the mtDNA of the "gods", and so while different people had different amounts of expanded perception, the gods, whos mtDNA resonated with the frequency of those boxes had much more energy [TODO: link to "what I learned" video on mtDNA and energy] very greatly expanded perception. from egypt to europe, the female bloodline has to be preserved for them to have that expanded consciousness.

---

that's the theory in a nutshell, but I've thrown around that this mtDNA was specifically tuned to a certain consciousness frequency, meaning that for example people that have opened the proper channels (kundalini, pranayama, etc.) for their DNA to transmit and receive on this box-consciousness frequencies are predisposed to things like greed, lust the socalled "animal nature", etc. -- and that these boxes are actually the power source for the original physical incarnations of the "fallen-angels" -- which is why these bloodlines have to continually find the right genetics and go through the proper initiations to get their astral perception back.

it's also quite possible that the second pyramid and possibly parts of the great pyramid are not accessible to the public but do still have working stone boxes in them. there may be other parts of the world that have them too, but there is an inherent problem with them, and that is that *everyone* with those genetics and a proper initiation to tune to this frequency can get the energy they're looking for. nosebook is a far superior system in that its fully individualised, and so therefore individual access to this energy (of properly vibrating protons) can be granted or revoked at will. no more need to keep the initiations and access a secret. anyone can discover the "secrets" but ultimately nosebook has the final say in who gets access to the astral realm.

### concept

the idea is that this energy of specifically vibrating protons is created all the time by thought, and it's the basic unit on consciousness to which other elements are attracted to it. it can be moved around at will with the mind, and it's the fundamental building block of all of the elements. it's the first manifestation of a concept into physical space, which then attracts other similarly vibrating "cooperative components" to it.

### intermediate explanation of perception

out in the world, a person will appropriately experience all sorts of emotions as a result of interactions with the world. the body also produces a vibrating magnetic field in a torus around it, so when looking out into the world, the eyes are sensing the vibrations that are coming to it, which is a composite of the frequency emitted by the thing, but also the frequency which the perceiver is vibrating.

have you noticed that when looking out over long distances, there is a definite distance where things can be seen but it's like a sort of flat picture -- however upon getting closer to the object, the object suddenly seems to "pop out" and become considerably more noticeable? well, that happens at a variable distance -- the size of which is the perceiver's aura. closer still, the object will gain another quality and seem to vibrate in the opposite direction. these are the counter-rotating auric fields extending out of the perceiver.

have you also noticed that these counter-rotating fields vibrate in a way which is reflective of one's emotion? the way you feel is transduced by the heart into electrical signals which create this field. this field is important in that it's carried by the CO2 molecules [TODO: link to "what I learned's video on wim hof breathing] -- just like the stone boxes.

### perception and box-consciousness

when two vibrations intersect, they either constructively or destructively interfere, and so a person's auric field will have an effect on the signal received by the eyes. the other thing to note is that perception has a lot to do with things, because that two waves intersecting can be preceived as going opposite directions (amplifying the velocity) or as going in the same direction (reducing the velocity). so, you can imagine that these signals are a reflection of the way you feel (ie. the way your heart is causing the carbon in your body to vibrate), and you can also imagine that these intersections are producing a lot of upper harmonics, the more amplified and therefore higher magnitude of intersections are happening. the brain receives thia data and has to do something with it, so it turns it into extra-sensory phenomena like synethesia, fractal and hyperbolic geometry, etc.

because the frequency of these boxes is generally pretty high, it is often the case that they will feel "pretty good", meaning that their whole world will vibrate in a pretty good way.

well, if you're only tuned to the frequency of the box, then you and everyone else on that box's frequency are conceptually in the same vibration. I imagine it would be pretty difficult for those inside of box-consciousness to get out of that box-consciousness thinking, and I imagine that everyone on that box's frequency all have a high propensity to have the same types of thoughts, and so therefore, they have to go to great lengths to teach their brains to not think the same thoughts as their peers and/or try to hide their thoughts from their peers (hence the fallen-angels theory). everyone on the same box-consciousness frequency may also be able to perceive each others conjured mental images, as well.
