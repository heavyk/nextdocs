# straight-shooting

the name of this concept was inspired by the persian phrase, "speak truth and shoot strait the arrows".

when I tell someone else something that is untrue, the thing is that I know it's untrue -- so really now, I'm now relying on the other person's belief in my words for the manifestation to be different. if I didn't tell the person the untruth, then my own belief would eventually manifest.

let's take an example: let's say that I have a project that isn't going so well. if someone asks me how is it going, and I answer, "it's going well" -- but, deep down I know that it's pretty close to falling apart, my own belief in the project will eventually catch up to me.

I'm essentially trying to convince other people to believe in something that I cannot believe in.

there are more implications to this as well. (TODO)

I'm also undecided whether it should be straight-shooting or shooting-straight. (TODO)

I also didn't talk about all of the advantages and why I feel it's important to be truthful. (TODO)
