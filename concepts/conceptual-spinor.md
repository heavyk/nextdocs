I've been thinking about the idea of a spinor in conceptual form. I first had the idea in @[blahblog](2022-03-01 01:57) when I wrote about science and religion:

> it's kind of a bit of a return to the mixing of science and religion, but in the negative form. on one side you have science and religion so deeply intertwined they are the same thing. then, you go a full 360(degrees) around the circle and you have nearly the same thing: science so divorced from religion that it is a religion.

thing is, that accounts for the N/S, but what about E/W?

```
           science and religion interwined
science and religion so divorced that science is a religion 
                        |
                ?   ----+----   ?
                        |
    science and religion completely separated
                        ?
```

so, this is kind of a mental exercise for me to try and figure out the perpendicular polarities.

one idea I had was that of God, and you could say on the E side there, that God is responsible for everything ie everything predestined while the other side would be that humans have full control over their experience. that seems to work pretty well, but let's keep exploring.

the other idea that I had was one of polarities (or gender in human form). in other creative endeavours, it's noticed that certain phases of expansion or contraction are experienced and desired.

I think of time as being at expansive/attractive concept, while space, I think of as a contractive/assertive concept. in time, there are always more and more possibilities, so the number of possiblities is constantly expanding. it's impossible not to continue to expand, however what prevents it from expanding indefinitely is that everything is constantly being attracted to everything else, so sort of pathways begin to emerge as the more common ways to get from one point to another. in space, I'm still largely confused about what it would mean, but when I say contractive, I mean decay or deterioration, and for assertive, I mean that it takes effort to build things. complex things don't just build theirselves, and so some sort of effort must be expended to create a new thing (which will inevitably fall victim to time[^1], and in the decay process deteriorate back to "nothing").

so then looking at that perspective one may say that E side is the assertive/contractive+effort/deterioration side, while the W side is attractive/expansive+effortless/accumulation side. that kinda works too, but I don't see a logical progression yet. let's try...

^^^ science and religion intertwined
>>> set down laws, be assertive, and get rid of all of the non-compliers
vvv science and religion separated
<<< attract what you want, and let in everything you desire
---
^^^ science and religion are so divorced that science is a religion
>>> deterioration/overwork is setting in, everything is falling apart, so things have to be optimised to cope with the extra effort
vvv science and religion are completely incompatible
<<< fix/create everything that's important (everything is connected and so affects everything else)

OH OK, so maybe a missing thing here in the connection between the two is *belief*, because both science and religion are based on belief...

religion is founded on the idea that what we experience is what God has ordained/created for us to experience. science is founded on the idea that natural processes act on existing things in a systematic way producing predictable results. religion allows for the unexpected, while science does not wish to have unexpected or unexplainable things. so, in a sense, religion is experience extended out of will or desire, while science is a experience extended out of  "natural" (systematic) processes.

so what exactly is "natural", anyway? natural is what we believe is natural. it's what we believe is acceptable. eugene brings up a good point in specialization theory, when he explains that the mixing of spececies to be unnatural -- abominations and against nature. what the definition of species is illustrating is the racist and "no intermixing" style of belief present at the time. all things should be pure and without contamination of the other species. what we believe natural to be is either an extension of what "God" has defined as natural, or it's what science believes to be an explainable process -- for, if the process were unexpected or unexplainable, then it wouldn't be "natural".

so this is beginning to reveal a new way of defining the N<->S axis. if we replace "God" as desire/will and "religion" as the process of making that desire or will become a reality which can be experienced, then a new diagram of the conceptual spinor emerges:

```
                    (0 religion and science interwined)
the realisation of desire/will into reality are the natural processes which compose reality
        (360 religion and science are so divorced that science is a religion)
    natural processes are the *only way* desire/will are realised into reality
                                    |
                 (270 ?)            |                 (90 ?)
          attract what you want     |     set down laws, be assertive
 let everything in you will/desire  |   get rid of all of the non-compliers
                                ----+----
               (630 ?)              |                 (450 ?)
        everything is connected     |   deterioration/overwork is setting in
everything affects everything else  |      everything is falling apart
       fix everything important     | start optimisating to cope with the extra effort
      create things to stabilise    |
                                    |
              (180 science and religion completely separated)
    the realisation of desire/will into reality is *not* a natural process
    natural processes are *not* the realisation of desire/will into reality
            (540 science and religion are completely incompatible)
natural processes are incompatible with the realisation of desire/will in reality
            
```

OK that's a much more complete conceptual spinor. I kinda like it because it pretty well captures the phases of society, and you can even see the progression of the 7-layers-of-perception in there where 0/360 is desire, 180/540 is physical, 90/450 is logic/structure, and 270/630 is conceptual. it also (if you stretch it a bit) captures kinda well the phases of a culture or civilisation through time and space where the passage through each cardinal point spells the destruction of the opposite.

I'm not fully convinced though, so I'll keep thinking on it.

[1]: I plan on making various puns like this throughout the course of the discussion to illustrate that it's all the same thing just perceived from a different angle, no angle ever being "the right way"
