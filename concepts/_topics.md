a collection of ideas that I think could be examined conceptually.


- you're only ever fighting yourself
- electromagnetic theory
- transcending physical reality (elijah/enoch/ramtha)
  - consciously making one's transition into non-physical

- box consciousness
  - protons as consciousness units having a unique vibration
  - the closer in vibration they are, the closer in 3d space they are

- limestone and iron oxide
- amazons on the island of california

the reason why this concept works is because *everything* is in motion. nothing really is still.

anything using propulsion that tries to keep going in the same direction (business-as-usual) will have to use more and more energy to propel itself forward. this is because the further you go out, the more rarified it gets and the less there is to push against to propel itself forward. propulsion requires one to push against something to move the opposite direction. this becomes more difficult as density decreases.

I'm reminded of a veritassium video of a guy riding a bike with the steering locked. in order to turn right, you have to first turn left. same thing with concepts. in order to go conceptually right, you have to first go conceptually left. it's never a good idea to spend a terrible amount of time going left if you want to go right, cause otherwise you'll just go left instead of right, or heading in the same direction you started initially.

the reason why this concept works is because *everything* is in motion. nothing really is still. if anything energetic tries to keep going in the same direction (like DC electricity), it will incur great losses, hovever alternating back and fourth between two opposite directions allows much higher efficiency and less power loss[^1].

[1]: I keep being reminded that power lines use high voltage DC transmission to incur only a resistive loss. I understand that's how it's done with wires. I wish to make my example understood without wires or metal conductors, but I don't know how to do it at this time. likely, we'll need a few more advances in our understanding of capacitors and propagation of energy through insulators before that's possible.
