the alpha-omega cycle has two seeming opposed concepts constantly battling for dominance. they rotate opposite of each other so they appear opposed. the alpha concept rises to dominance before beginning its decline from the top. the omega wanes into nothingness before being reborn into a new concept.

this pattern is the same for conceptual progression, as well as visual progression, and can be seen in the counter-rotating fields seen at different altitudes and latitudes (like jupiter's bands or the stratosphere vs ionosphere).

the idea behind this one is that each time there is a change in perception, whether it's a dimensional increase or whatever, the orientation changes. it usually manifests as inward and outward looking/flowing.

so, for conceptual progression for a social group on the planet or you personally, you will wax and wane between outward and inward flow. if the alpha concept is group-thinking in the previous era, the next era (when the omega is reborn) will be about individually-thinking.

likewise, if visually, if you perceive the world from an inwardly-looking perspective (ie 3d or 5d), then you will notice your vision expanding further and further out becoming lower and lower densities. this happens because the sphere nearest to you will keep becoming more and more dense (higher and higher detailed) until it reaches a point where the attraction causes it to invert. then, the orientation swaps and now it will be outwardly-looking (ie 4d or 6d).

in science this is known as counter-rotating fields of lesser and lesser density like the stratosphere and ionosphere. each concept change will always be of lesser density (higher frequency) than the previous and also rotate in the opposite diretction.

I'll probably need to clean up the presentation of this one later. I'm mixing the words density and high frequency. I mean density because the nearer you are to the origin, the stronger the attraction and so therefore the more dense. usually more dense means lower frequency, but not for vibration. sound travels through granite many time more rapidly than through air.

likewise, a person's aura is most dense nearby to them and rarifies with distance. this is also the most highest frequency, and I think the stuff "inside" is always the most high frequecy (like sub-atomic particles and such)
