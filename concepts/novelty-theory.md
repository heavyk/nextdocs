# novelty-theory

as I'm going along I'm realising new things about terence's novelty theory as I'm kinda figuring it out (through inspiration/tuning of some kind), and so this just kinda records some notes.

### 2022-09-22 23:03 - fear is an inability to calculate probabilities

I noticed just now when looking at anti-novelty concept, that these produce desire, each in their own ways.

fear is a desire for something unfortunate to happen, but if you connect that to the concept of fear being an incapability of calculating probabilities -- or any other probabilities calculation failure. we don't want to look at the things that we can't calculate the probabilities of, so we "fear" these improbable concepts, thereby attracting their WPM.

first description of anti-novelty's role in the process

### 2022-09-22 23:11 - anti-novelty

I wanted to talk about anti-novelty because I couldn't remember what I wrote down the other way which means the concept has been evolved significantly since I last visited it (which is when I wrote it).

#### habit

the obvious first one is habit. habit is the desire to optimise something. it's to take one route the fastest way possible. habit is structure and rules, habit is needing things to be where you expect them to be so I can continue my habit. nothing new going on.

however, just the other day I could see between 2 and 4 more dimensions to it (depending on which memory I looked at)... at the moment I can only remember one...

#### probabilities

the ability for a human to calculate probabilites is an emergent evolution that's happened relatively recently. since I've begun to look at this a bit closer, it's completely reshaped how I think of the human capability. you have to consider that we are literally novelty/anci-novelty incarnate in these physical bodies. like, we are all our own universe that evolves and transforms according to the novelty function that the person uses. that function is your perception -- the way that you coalesce concepts together to derive meaning.

we have the capability to calculate and evaluate things better. some people use probabilities to reach a goal ("what are the chances I can make ..."). however, I think for me, I use it mostly to try and come up with the most likely thing that could be happening. this has essentially stemmed from conspiracy theories. there are so many out there, and so I set out to try and figure out what is *actually* the most likely thing to be happening.

there are a lot of really worried people out there, and it sounds like there are cryptozoology and a whole astrally based set of cultures that seem pretty worried as well. there's just so much to worry about, I had to try and figure out how to what is the most likely thing to be happening.

like, for example imagine something goes missing and if I'm really pissed off, I'll jump into a flurry thinking someone stole my shit, that is definitely the time to think about what is the likeliest thing to have happened. usually, I misplaced it anyway. so, instead of making action, I think try and think about the most likely possibility of something happening instead of making action.

there are also really important implications for probabilities to enable to optimise our BPM/WPM scenarios. since we know that fear porn totally sells, it sounds to me like there are some people that are just really interested in the worst possible manifestation (real downers like myself), and there are others that try and strive for the best. that feeds into comparison which is the first order of logic.
