# novelty-theory

as I'm going along I'm realising new things about terence's novelty theory as I'm kinda figuring it out (through inspiration/tuning of some kind), and so this just kinda records some notes.

### 2022-09-22 23:03 - fear is an inability to calculate probabilities

I noticed just now when looking at anti-novelty concept, that these produce desire, each in their own ways.

fear is a desire for something unfortunate to happen, but if you connect that to the concept of fear being an incapability of calculating probabilities -- or any other probabilities calculation failure. we don't want to look at the things that we can't calculate the probabilities of, so we "fear" these improbable concepts, thereby attracting their WPM.

first description of anti-novelty's role in the process
