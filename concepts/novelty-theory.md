# novelty-theory

as I'm going along I'm realising new things about terence's novelty theory as I'm kinda figuring it out (through inspiration/tuning of some kind), and so this just kinda records some notes.

### 2022-09-22 23:03 - fear is an inability to calculate probabilities

I noticed just now when looking at anti-novelty concept, that these produce desire, each in their own ways.

fear is a desire for something unfortunate to happen, but if you connect that to the concept of fear being an incapability of calculating probabilities -- or any other probabilities calculation failure. we don't want to look at the things that we can't calculate the probabilities of, so we "fear" these improbable concepts, thereby attracting their WPM.

first description of anti-novelty's role in the process

### 2022-09-22 23:11 - anti-novelty

I wanted to talk about anti-novelty because I couldn't remember what I wrote down the other way which means the concept has been evolved significantly since I last visited it (which is when I wrote it).

#### habit

the obvious first one is habit. habit is the desire to optimise something. it's to take one route the fastest way possible. habit is structure and rules, habit is needing things to be where you expect them to be so I can continue my habit. nothing new going on.

however, just the other day I could see between 2 and 4 more dimensions to it (depending on which memory I looked at)... at the moment I can only remember one...

#### probabilities

the ability for a human to calculate probabilites is an emergent evolution that's happened relatively recently. since I've begun to look at this a bit closer, it's completely reshaped how I think of the human capability. you have to consider that we are literally novelty/anci-novelty incarnate in these physical bodies. like, we are all our own universe that evolves and transforms according to the novelty function that the person uses. that function is your perception -- the way that you coalesce concepts together to derive meaning.

we have the capability to calculate and evaluate things better. some people use probabilities to reach a goal ("what are the chances I can make ..."). however, I think for me, I use it mostly to try and come up with the most likely thing that could be happening. this has essentially stemmed from conspiracy theories. there are so many out there, and so I set out to try and figure out what is *actually* the most likely thing to be happening.

there are a lot of really worried people out there, and it sounds like there are cryptozoology and a whole astrally based set of cultures that seem pretty worried as well. there's just so much to worry about, I had to try and figure out how to what is the most likely thing to be happening.

like, for example imagine something goes missing and if I'm really pissed off, I'll jump into a flurry thinking someone stole my shit, that is definitely the time to think about what is the likeliest thing to have happened. usually, I misplaced it anyway. so, instead of making action, I think try and think about the most likely possibility of something happening instead of making action.

there are also really important implications for probabilities to enable to optimise our BPM/WPM scenarios. since we know that fear porn totally sells, it sounds to me like there are some people that are just really interested in the worst possible manifestation (real downers like myself), and there are others that try and strive for the best. that feeds into comparison which is the first order of logic.

### 2022-09-22 23:55 - small thing that will probably be relevant later

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/9qn0dxJoN_Q)

somehow I got to that video and as I'm watching her crochet, I notice that when she's explaining the things, she's counted it all off, so she'll get the result she's looking for, but she has no imagination to in the european sense that she can clearly see the result of her labour in her mind's eye.

one observation is that I made this observation in relation to my saying the [language is a barrier](/random-thoughts.md#2022-09-22-2210---language-as-an-inhibitor), where I noticed this with the peruvians because I spent a lot of time at alfredo's bar, and so I started to get to notice that the spanish people are all getting worked up over all this political stuff, but they appeared to me like they didn't care. their "care" and "concern" that they had for all the situations the spanish were worked up about, felt to me almost as robotic. I figured they had been programmed by society and culture that certain things are, some good, and some bad; and from that we adjust accordingly.

you know, when looking at that, I nocticed that europeans tond to see the image in their mind, but it seems that the peruvians are actually more like me. I really do think it's the language. spanish is fine if you have an imagination and everyone is passing around mental imagery, but if you don't have an imagination (like me), spanish is so inhibiting. I notice how much more my mind has expanded just getting back into english from spanish. english is by no means very good either, as I have many difficulties with it, it is still an upgrade on spanish, by a lot (spanish does offer a few things, but they're not essential).

one of the things that I liked about spanish is that gustar goes to something -- so, something likes *to me* -- which is a pretty good improvement on how the world can be structured. you see, spanish is all based on action, which is one of those language ironies, where spanish is all about being forceful and making action happen, the thing is, he doesn't *like* that girl. instead, that girl *likes to him* -- exactly backwards.

so if you think about the opposite to that would be a language all about things coming *to you*, but probably to make things fun, when it comes to the opposite gender, we ned to go and get them forcefully (aun weor). I have a lot of ideas on it because the language should involve all of those aspects of anti-novelty as deeply inbedded in the language.

well, maybe not doing the foreceful romance thing, so instead we should just see all things as only as coming to you (capitalise on the victim mentality), so that everything happening is your fault and you're attracting them, leaving out the repelling force entirely (like only having only one side of a magnet is a bit of a fallacy). I think that's a better compromise. why compromise? you can do what you want, but I gatta have the contrast. it's sorta like I live in this thread perhaps visualised as a timeline, and I'm sorta going around tirando al hilo till I've figured everything out (I have to figure everything out).

a desire to figure things out is not granted by a language. you can only desire to figure things out when you want to figure them out. likewise, you only put the puzzle together when you want to put it together. most of the images are pretty boring to look at though so there's not much of a reward to put the puzzle together. instead you do it for how you feel finding the pieces and finding the spot for them. you desire the feeling, not the completed puzzle picture.

---

looking at it again at second glance, I can see it clearly. it looks to me like they do have images, but these are memories, not what europeans would consider imagination. recalling a memory is different than creating in your mind, which is also different from allowing something to flow through you. the nice thing is that recalling a memory is sorta like the beginning process, but because the memory comes in so quickly we see the image of the memory instead of feeling that concept begin to flow through you. any concept can be "channeled" into anything from dance and sound to visuals. I think this is what they do in those ayahuasca ceremonies.

so, it's just a transition away from wanting to see that memory. it's a letting go of the past so you can feel the concept in its native form rathar than the inferior (IMO) picture form.

memory -> feeling/concept

### 2022-09-23 19:04 - event sheduling

it occurs to me that another form of anti-novelty is the desire to shedule events. it's an interesting case because the anti-novelty version is wanting to shedule events for someone else, but the desire to shedule event for oneself is itself novelty because what kind of events are we talking about? are we talking about manifestations, or simple reminders like, "I want to remember X tomorrow and sure enough sometime tomorrow the thing pops into my head.

inotherwords, the different forms of desire to produce events for oneself is itself another manifestation of novelty. it's also a bit of self-identity as well. in this case, the medium really is the message, because the reminder really is only as good as the mind can do.

some are at setting remiders for theirselves better than others, cause like for example marc is just insane how he just produces metatasks and then everything just works out in autopilot, which he just gives out the reminders. what blows my mind is how he's able to just let his body perform the meta task automatically. I know it's a lot of practise to get used to it, kinda like typing, but even that for me is really hard. my body just doesn't do what I want it to do. it's like I'm a perpetual 1yo or so. I used to think it was annoying but not anymore, because it's one of the things that keeps me childlike. I really enjoy my imperfections. that's my secret, ya know.

oops, that's the end.

### 2022-09-23 19:42 - forethought and afterthought are both feelings

think about it: before you think a thought, you have a feeling, and also after every thought you will also feel a feeling.

yesterday when I was watching tejidos diana, one of the things that I noticed is that when she was speaking, she wasn't transmitting a mental image. for example when watching JD, when he talks, he also puts out a mental image of what he's talking about. I can't see it though, but I've begun to figure out his symbology and begin to "see" (more like know) what the other person is seeing. I think I started this trend with chris I think, and I've found it's a really useful thing for me to turn the other person's mental image into words. it's likely been stifled a bit because of nosebook, but apparently I can see others' astral image pretty well, even though I can't see it. well, I noticed that diana doesn't put an image into my mind.

after looking into it, I came to the conclusion that she is probably using memory, and that's why I can't see it, because it's not on my frequency at all. however, I did notice a lot of other sensory input that wasn't visual. I didn't even know what she was making because I couldn't remember how the thumbnail looked, so for a long time I was trying to figure out her projection of what they're trying to create.

I run into this alot actually, and it's because people are so busy looking at the picture in their imagination, they don't see the stuff that's not there. each and every bit in the imagination has a "cost" to its creation, but none of that is seen. instead, her way is similar to my own, in that she just jumps into the process of it, and let's what turn out to be what it is (that's the sense that I had). so, if the origin of that concept is actually memory, it'll be nearly identical (sizes and yarns may change, but it'll be pretty similar).

if that's memory, then I have the same thing; I have reality-kenny -- which is just the guy that jumps into the process and just figures out how to get there. I perceive him as invincible, and I can just like throw him into situations and he finds a way out. I don't worry too much about all of the details; I just follow the steps according to memory. I'm reminded of an event where I took the battery out, not because I had to, but simply becase that's how I remembered it being done. I didn't question it. I just did it.

so, really this upgrade is sorta to exist in that forethought and afterthought universe. you know I don't really control many of my thoughts anymore. thoughts come and I just sorta find ways to feel good about them. living almost excclusively in that zone between thought, I find myself constatntly feeling good or bad about what I just said, so mostly I'm just listening to myself talk, because it's a major source of good-feeling when I recognise some enlightening thing I just said; it's kinda a drug.

it's kind of a new way to think honestly, where I just let the situation work itself out just how I feel about it.

### 2022-09-30 11:05 - timewave as a 2d perspective of the alpha/omega

I don't really know how to explain this concept so well. I may struggle because it's the very first rendering of the idea.

when I looked at any atom, I could see that it had a cyclical vibration to it, but also an amplitude, which I equated with DC biased AC. that vibration repeats over and over fractally over different durations of time -- meaning that you'll see the same vibrational pattern over 1 time unit as over 64 time units, and over 1024 time units, etc. each octave repeats the same sequence. terence decoded this sequence using the i-ching as a method for working out the 64 different "angles" the novelty sequence could take. this produced a fractal wave that was self-similar on every octave (doubling of frequency/time).

you also know that I've claimed that roughly ~1kya the present solar regime was put into place, and that solar regime encodes a "concept". I claimed that before the current regime, the concept was physical-reality-is-everything. at the peak of that regime is when jesus showed up. his "death" was important because after that physical-reality-is-everything begins to wane and because of his interactions with the romans, the new concept of mutual-back-scratching begins to emerge. I claim that mutual-back-scratching is at its peak right now (hence the reason why I see sales and marketing becoming the new "authority" from now on) and even right now my influence on society is beginning the new regime which I've identified as the concept feeling-purposefully.

I don't really know the mechanism for it, but it seems to have something to do with 2nd ray energy. I believe that the i-ching was something that one of the great mysics of that time figured out to be a pretty good aproximation of the frequency of that concept.

---

the thing that I don't really know how to explain is how the wave is both cyclical and also accelerating. it's likely something that I don't understand with EM/wave theory, because I can see that the frequency starts and end at the same position, so it is cyclical, but because every octave has the same curve to it, it appears to me that as I zoom out, I can see the resulting magnitude of each moment, adds up to be more than it was previously, and so the wave, after some time runs off toward infinity -- at which point, consciousness has gained enough momentum that a new alpha/omega shows up and encodes a new concept, reflective of the consciousness that has emerged. that new concept is always (let's say) not in direct opposition to the previous concept, but it looks about 90(degrees) perpendicular to the previous concept, because both of these concepts are going to be waxing and waning simultaneously, so they can't be completely in opposition to each other. it looks to me like "turning a corner" (going a slightly different angle/direction) rather than battling over the same path. the waxing concept helps to conclude the previous one (like a chapter in a storybook), meanwhile the waning concept aids to "perfect" the waxing concept by ensuring that the waxing concept cannot recycle the old concept directly (it would completely self-annihilate rather than expand into more), and so conflicting vibrations (when they're going opposite directions) annihilate each other, and so therefore all that's left are the harmonious bits (when they're going the same direction).

it'd be fun to model this, because even two different dualing expressions of the form y=mx+b (self-similar at every octave) would produce quite an interesting result. what I *don't* know how to do is to create fractically self-similar waveforms, though because I seem to be able to produce them (or at least pretty good aproximations of it), it would be an intersting thing to look at, especially considering integrating this concept with the [series of mechanical oscillators](/statics-updates.md#2022-09-21-1823---dial-in-the-frequency) idea. the reason for this is that it looks to me like a fractally self-similar wave (or a pretty close aproximation) would have very dramatically amplifying effects to it. I wonder if tesla took that concept and applied it to electricity rather than to statics. that (I'm trying to do a randall impression here) *could be perhaps* another way to look at the tunguska blast[^1].

[1]: reactions wants me to explain what I mean. the surface of the earth (geology) emits an EM(?) vibration of some kind, which I believe is pretty constant, but most powerful when the sun is rising (hence the vitrified stones in various megalithic sites), and so that is one of the waves. this wave needs to "dual" with another wave, which could have been produced by a meteor entering the atmosphere (the waves coming off of the front of the asteroid look like the waves of when you blow across the top of a bottle or around an airplane wing), and that can perhaps interfere with the vibration coming off out of the surface geology to create imense heat (kinda like perhaps the chicago fires). the reason why I included tesla into the sentence there is because, if tesla was vibrating the ionosphere in a dualing way with a corresponding frequency coming from the surface of the earth (there was a reason why he had such a grounding system below the wardenclyffe tower), in a way that was similar to the mechanical oscillator, it could produce a comet like result. inotherwords, I don't believe the meteor/comet needs to impact to produce a vibration which could reach an amplitude capable producing other secondary effects on other frequencies (light, heat, sound, etc.).
