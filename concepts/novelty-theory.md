# novelty-theory

as I'm going along I'm realising new things about terence's novelty theory as I'm kinda figuring it out (through inspiration/tuning of some kind), and so this just kinda records some notes.

### 2022-09-22 23:03 - fear is an inability to calculate probabilities

I noticed just now when looking at anti-novelty concept, that these produce desire, each in their own ways.

fear is a desire for something unfortunate to happen, but if you connect that to the concept of fear being an incapability of calculating probabilities -- or any other probabilities calculation failure. we don't want to look at the things that we can't calculate the probabilities of, so we "fear" these improbable concepts, thereby attracting their WPM.

first description of anti-novelty's role in the process

### 2022-09-22 23:11 - anti-novelty

I wanted to talk about anti-novelty because I couldn't remember what I wrote down the other way which means the concept has been evolved significantly since I last visited it (which is when I wrote it).

#### habit

the obvious first one is habit. habit is the desire to optimise something. it's to take one route the fastest way possible. habit is structure and rules, habit is needing things to be where you expect them to be so I can continue my habit. nothing new going on.

however, just the other day I could see between 2 and 4 more dimensions to it (depending on which memory I looked at)... at the moment I can only remember one...

#### probabilities

the ability for a human to calculate probabilites is an emergent evolution that's happened relatively recently. since I've begun to look at this a bit closer, it's completely reshaped how I think of the human capability. you have to consider that we are literally novelty/anci-novelty incarnate in these physical bodies. like, we are all our own universe that evolves and transforms according to the novelty function that the person uses. that function is your perception -- the way that you coalesce concepts together to derive meaning.

we have the capability to calculate and evaluate things better. some people use probabilities to reach a goal ("what are the chances I can make ..."). however, I think for me, I use it mostly to try and come up with the most likely thing that could be happening. this has essentially stemmed from conspiracy theories. there are so many out there, and so I set out to try and figure out what is *actually* the most likely thing to be happening.

there are a lot of really worried people out there, and it sounds like there are cryptozoology and a whole astrally based set of cultures that seem pretty worried as well. there's just so much to worry about, I had to try and figure out how to what is the most likely thing to be happening.

like, for example imagine something goes missing and if I'm really pissed off, I'll jump into a flurry thinking someone stole my shit, that is definitely the time to think about what is the likeliest thing to have happened. usually, I misplaced it anyway. so, instead of making action, I think try and think about the most likely possibility of something happening instead of making action.

there are also really important implications for probabilities to enable to optimise our BPM/WPM scenarios. since we know that fear porn totally sells, it sounds to me like there are some people that are just really interested in the worst possible manifestation (real downers like myself), and there are others that try and strive for the best. that feeds into comparison which is the first order of logic.

### 2022-09-22 23:55 - small thing that will probably be relevant later

somehow I got to that video and as I'm watching her crochet, I notice that when she's explaining the things, she's counted it all off, so she'll get the result she's looking for, but she has no imagination to in the european sense that she can clearly see the result of her labour in her mind's eye.

one observation is that I made this observation in relation to my saying the [language is a barrier](/random-thoughts.md#2022-09-22-2210---language-as-an-inhibitor), where I noticed this with the peruvians because I spent a lot of time at alfredo's bar, and so I started to get to notice that the spanish people are all getting worked up over all this political stuff, but they appeared to me like they didn't care. their "care" and "concern" that they had for all the situations the spanish were worked up about, felt to me almost as robotic. I figured they had been programmed by society and culture that certain things are, some good, and some bad; and from that we adjust accordingly.

you know, when looking at that, I nocticed that europeans tond to see the image in their mind, but it seems that the peruvians are actually more like me. I really do think it's the language. spanish is fine if you have an imagination and everyone is passing around mental imagery, but if you don't have an imagination (like me), spanish is so inhibiting. I notice how much more my mind has expanded just getting back into english from spanish. english is by no means very good either, as I have many difficulties with it, it is still an upgrade on spanish, by a lot (spanish does offer a few things, but they're not essential).

one of the things that I liked about spanish is that gustar goes to something -- so, something likes *to me* -- which is a pretty good improvement on how the world can be structured. you see, spanish is all based on action, which is one of those language ironies, where spanish is all about being forceful and making action happen, the thing is, he doesn't *like* that girl. instead, that girl *likes to him* -- exactly backwards.

so if you think about the opposite to that would be a language all about things coming *to you*, but probably to make things fun, when it comes to the opposite gender, we ned to go and get them forcefully (aun weor). I have a lot of ideas on it because the language should involve all of those aspects of anti-novelty as deeply inbedded in the language.

well, maybe not doing the foreceful romance thing, so instead we should just see all things as only as coming to you (capitalise on the victim mentality), so that everything happening is your fault and you're attracting them, leaving out the repelling force entirely (like only having only one side of a magnet is a bit of a fallacy). I think that's a better compromise. why compromise? you can do what you want, but I gatta have the contrast. it's sorta like I live in this thread perhaps visualised as a timeline, and I'm sorta going around tirando al hilo till I've figured everything out (I have to figure everything out).

a desire to figure things out is not granted by a language. you can only desire to figure things out when you want to figure them out. likewise, you only put the puzzle together when you want to put it together. most of the images are pretty boring to look at though so there's not much of a reward to put the puzzle together. instead you do it for how you feel finding the pieces and finding the spot for them. you desire the feeling, not the completed puzzle picture.

---

looking at it again at second glance, I can see it clearly. it looks to me like they do have images, but these are memories, not what europeans would consider imagination. recalling a memory is different than creating in your mind, which is also different from allowing something to flow through you. the nice thing is that recalling a memory is sorta like the beginning process, but because the memory comes in so quickly we see the image of the memory instead of feeling that concept begin to flow through you. any concept can be "channeled" into anything from dance and sound to visuals. I think this is what they do in those ayahuasca ceremonies.

so, it's just a transition away from wanting to see that memory. it's a letting go of the past so you can feel the concept in its native form rathar than the inferior (IMO) picture form.

memory -> feeling/concept
