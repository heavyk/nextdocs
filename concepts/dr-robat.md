dr. pierre marie robitallie ?? I can't ever remember how to spell his last name. it's a subject of great concern for me that such a name would be so hard to remember. I noticed that I was trying to remember a woman's name but she had a weird name that I couldn't remember either.

he's got a different version of how the sun works and I really like his theory because the more I think about it, the more it fits into the physical (you have to have a real surface) implementation of the sun. I tend to like to explore the abstract, conceptual and (LOA) aspects of the sun, though our starting points differ a bit, I'm still trying to assimilate his concepts without a knowlede of chemistry or physics. so like when I finally get something, it sorta sinks in like the whole you need a vibrational lattice to make a continuous spectrum, which means that means it's outputting many different frequencies across a whole spectrum. any realit is possible because of the complexity of the signal coming off of it.

so I try to visualise how a carbon 12 atom would look, so it would have 6 verticies, and so you have a square with a top and a bottom vertex (or, maybe its the top half of a cube's point, which is also 6) and I don't get it. it seems to me that an array of these shapes: square with two normals on either side where length along is some function that I don't know how to describe cause the function is dynamic. the other is the top part of a corner of a cube. anyway, it seems like a whole clump of these guys would dampen the vibration much like studio sound foam does to sound. that's probably why it looks matte normally. when it's turned into colour, it's the other undefined function that's programmed it.

2 basic shapes I can see. one is a square that joins two four-sided pyramids on one side, where the height of the pyramid goes along the normal and it's height is the "charge" of that carbon molecule.

the other shape I can see looks like a cube (looking at its vertex) with the top and and two front faces missing in front and back.

on the side it looks like mountains,
on the top it looks like a hexagon,
its 6 verticies have 3d
(three-dimensional mountains, of course)

between these two faces. I can't distinguish them but now I can. if I look at vertexes from another angle (turn the mountains toward you), and that's the way to see the square as I described it above, but from essentially the middle of those lines is the equator of that is where the square is.

programming a carbon's colour is the cheapest way to make a memristor. I have no idea what that formula is, but water obviously can emulate it in a certain slightly unbalanced arrangement. unbalanced because I forget if it's negatively charged EZ water, but as far as I know this may be related to the "activation" of carbon -- where you probably add some hydrogens to it, and I wonder if these follow the normal for the square/triangle.
