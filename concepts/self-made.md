# self-made

the idea of being "self-made" is a trope that a lot of people go through, and it usually comes out of a tragedy of some kind. it is, in effect very similar to the "reborn deity" myth that occurs, most notably jesus and osiris (phoenix as well, but this is less defined).

usually there's a situation where the power source is somehow ruined (or connection to it is severed), and then there's a death/disaster that occurs because of it. there are various stages to this (grieving and resurrecting) process which happens, and sometimes the divine birth that comes out of the essence/ashes of the destroyed power, *recreates itself* by somehow rematerialising itself with a new essence.

although jesus' and osiris' are called "resurrection", I feel in both of these cases, it's *still* their individual process of recreating theirself in a new way to compensate (and usually improve upon) the factors which caused the destruction in the first place. in the case of jesus and osiris, the factors that caused the destruction in the first place were not their own doing, and so they're seen as a sort of "christ" to the social structure have a lot of influence over by making theirself the sacrifice, and in their own rebuilding process, the social structure benefits as well.

### reborn osiris notes

- resurrection sequence:
  - death
  - grieving
  - waiting time for rebirth
  - expectations of what happens afterward
    - (return to fertility)
    - crops begin to grow again
    - abundance returs
    - party with beer and drinking
    - how is osiris different now? (he's a different kind of god)
- osiris *resurrects himself*
  - yet, the resurrection of himself is supposedly done *with the help of his sister/wife isis* (doesn't make sense)
- resurrected with the help of a mother
  - yet, resurrected with the help of a consort/caretaker/wife
- the jesus reworking of the osiris resurrection, completely removes all sexuality (no wife, no girlfriend, no love, no sex)
  - really ancient (mesopotamian, egyptian, etc.) creation myths include a lot of sex everywhere.
  - eary iron age (1 millenium BC) starts to remove sex from creation myths: ptah speaks and the words become manifested, abrahamic traditions, etc.
- the full moon at the time of osiris' resurrection is relating the earth being between the sun (ra?) and moon (thoth) energies -- not necessarily masculine and feminine, because thoth wasn 't considered feminine.
  - I'd also like to note that he's resurrected at the hight of 7th ray energy on side and ra's 3rd ray energy on the other side.
    - I associate the moon directly with osiris, and not with thoth.
  - using my associations (of how I believe the setup to be presently):
    - the earth (-7,-1) is between:
      - the moon (+-6-+)
      - isis (-2)
    - so you can see two pillars there:
      - the one on the inside of the earth (-1 <-> -7)
      - the one on both sides of the earth (-2 <-> +-6-+)
    - inotherwords, these are two reflections:
      - the outer one of length 5 (isis and osiris)
      - the inner one of length 7 (anatau and gaia)
    - in the egyptian system, the length is also 5 between ra (+3) and thoth (+7), but the gender is swapped (both males), and lacks desire and now the internal one is both females/reflection
- egyptians later connected the innundation of the nile with the rebirth of osiris
  - nile innundation leaves behind a rich *black* silt/earth
  - the black silt earth represents the *body*
  - they then planted their *seeds* into the black earth/body
    - the connection with the moon doesn't make sense here though, because everyone knows that you should plant seeds on *new moon*, not full.
      - (so, not sure about that)
      - I see the moon as the height of thought/thoth power being the reason for the rebirth. thoth represented ritual accomplishment through spells and magical thought and writing, so the thought preparation and visualisation (for the crops) likely had a stronger effect back then (or in the nile valley) than it does now where we'd want to plant in the opposite phase (cause we're more physically/manifestation oriented now), and so for them the preparation time of thought is most important
        - the egyptians notably had a lot of things backwards from how they are today, and I belive that was because they were the main catalyst of flipping the polarities of reality creation (meaning that prior to the end of the last ice age, non-physical was receptive and physical was emissive, so reality had to kinda prove itself to the experiencer, sorta like how it is in a dream-state)
  - the egyptian seasons were kind of backwards from the ones that we experience: the flooding of the nile happens a little after the rainy season, and the flood is for the growing -- yet the planting season (for them) happens in the dry and barren summer months.
    - flooding starts in june and ends in august (fall season) -- which for the egyptians is like their spring when everything starts growing
    - the egyptians also have a bit of an opposite lifestyle to other civilisations, where the abundance of the nile allows them the egyptians to invest more time into art and non-essential technologies.
    - egyptians spent a lot of time developing mental technologies in the form of religous imagery and magical practises that other civilisations couldn't do because they're more concerned on survival (so, also backwards)
- elements of the jesus/osiris (reborn) deity/entity/god/man/whatever:
  - facing injustice
  - they're naive
  - going toward their injustice with open eyes (aware)
  - trusting in the people around them
  - offer up their body to the injustice
    - sacrifice to the human element to samsara
- more elements:
  - birth of a god that's foretold
  - divine birth (not necessarily virgin birth)
    - the god creates himself
    - the woman is just the vessel
    - the god puts his divine spirit (ka) into the woman (ba)
    - the god *creates himself* as the *sun god*
    - *he impregnates his own mother with his future self*
      - extremely interesting because this means that the DNA is capable of producing a body which then is able to recieve the ka (spirit) of the god (a sort of transferring of consciousness -- something I myself want to create the technology for doing, if it doesn't exist already)
    - there's a version of the god amun-re (solar deity, jupiter), amun-kamutef (jupiter, bull of his mother)
      - similar to how God (who is also jesus) is having sex with jesus' mother to produce physical jesus
      - similar to plutarch's description of plato's birth, where the god's numa (spirit) impregnated plato's mother
- ka materialising into physical form
  - in the shabaka stone:
    - ptah (of memphis)
      - formulates in his mind what he wants to create
      - he then speaks it
      - then through the magic (heca), it comes into being
    - he creates himself this way
    - he creates all of the elements this way
  - other more sexual texts depict two kings:
    - hatshepsut, amenhotep 3
    - mother was in bed resting, then the god amun-re (jupiter) visited her and has sex with her and so those kings (amenhotep and hatshepsut) have the essence of amun-re


- does the christian story remove sexuality from the story to make the myth/narrative seem less adopted and more original? (not like the osiris story)

- upon death, goes down to "hell", the underworld, hades -- which is essentially inner earth.
  - this, I believe is where saturn (satan) has setup his sorta setup.
  - in the jesus story, upon entering this inner earth, he conquers hell and sin and
