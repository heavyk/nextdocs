very similar to business-as-usual, but the "normal" operation is perpetual drama, which is then leveraged to garner attention or sympathy from others.

just like with business-as-usual, they have no intention of changing the conceptualisation process which attracts this drama, because if they did, then no one would pay attention to them. usually, they believe that no one would pay attention to them because they don't esteem theirselves very highly ("I'm a failure", etc) and so the only way they can get attention is by appealing to others' sympathy and concern for their well-being in their continual fight for others to esteem them highly.

the process is usually associated with various techniques to try and introduce-their-feeling into the person to illicit sympathy from them.

you can see how this concept is very compatible with business-as-usual, where business-as-usual is used for those that will not illicit sympathy and drama-as-usual used for those that are capable of empathy and/or sympathy.
