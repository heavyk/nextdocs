the idea here is, I took the 400y-bloom idea and expanded it out. there's this "prophecy" that somewhere around the "end times" there is this established "1000 years of peace" that will take place after the "christ" returns. I'm not the christ, so I think that has already happened (I refer to dtp and other things), and what I believe this timeline is, is the "anti-christ" timeline -- the polar opposite of the "christ" timeline, where a guy comes down from the sky saves all of the "good" people and punishes all of the "bad" people.

taking off from my wanted/unwanted is different than good/bad, I've given this idea some thought. the way it looks to me is, I serve as the "backbone" for this timeline, in that all of the edits to the timeline nosebook does by adjusting my perception. that means that at some level I have "temporal perception" (5.1) -- and also I believe that I have YHVH perception (5.2) as well, meaning they're capable of conjuring clones of me which can look any way and behave as any subset of my own personality and anything material out of thin air just by feeling it into place (though I'm sure they have some sort of visual (6) interface for this). this gives nosebook unlimited resources to try an keep their charade going.

normally, if something like that were to be given, it would cause such massive amounts of dissatisfaction on the planet[^1], a catastrophe won't be too far off, but I don't belive this will actually be happening because the antarctic civ is located at the south pole of the planet. for kundalini, this is analogous to controlling the energy at the base of the spine and the sex organs. this means that they can and will prevent the kundalini of the planet from rising (which is the precursor[^2] to all previous cataclysms, because astral is mixed with physical and reality will manifest as a reflection of emotion very rapidly in that state). this means that the antarctic civ can prevent a disaster by transforming the energy at the base of the spine and preventing the astral enery from rising for a very long time.

the next piece of this is outlined in leapfrogging-time-pickles, but I'll go over it in less detail here.

1000y is just a round number to denote one solar cycle. I believe that the sun has a 1024y cycle which the ancients rounded to 1000y, and we're coming up on the end and beginning of one of those cycles now. I do believe that less than 1024y have passed since jesus was crucified, which was the end of the last alpha-omega-cycle. this next cycle will be the one of "feeling-purposefully" whereas the previous one was "mutual-back-scratching".

those that are feeling-purposefully will eventually find their alignment, and so what that means is, like me, they'll gain temporal perception meaning they'll be able to reappear inside of the timeline (it's kinda like fallen-angels, but you can control the conceptual trajectory of the timeline you experience), and so jumping back into the timeline, you know for sure that you'll arrive back to where you are when you jump in, so you get to choose what path you take. in a world where manifestation of "things" is just a thought or two away, I find people will value that much less, so most people will optimise for lots of affection or none at all (I want to find my own way).

you can imagine how dramatically this will change our world, and I do imagine that eventually we'll start going elsewhere in the galaxy and start doing lots of cool stuff out there. the ones holding their charade going will have to try and keep the unauthorised humans from getting out into space, so they'll have to control that very heavily.

so let's just say that the end of this next solar cycle is coming up in 2046 like many have predicted, and it's nothing more than just a really strong solar cycle, but nothing catastrophic happened. you can imagine that they're going to want to keep people out of space, and they have to figure out how to do that for ~1000y or so.

I predict that because the new concept coming in, is feeling-purposefully, I imagine there will be a whole bunch of technology that comes up which controls how people feel physically, and that technology (I want to do some of it in the party-LAN project) will be used to keep people feeling the way they physically want to feel -- but, just like any drug out there, you build up a tolerance to it, so you have to keep upping the dose or have to find other alternatives. obviously, it'll be impractical for anyone to try and keep upping the dose for 1000y, so I figure that will give most people a chance to crash and burn a few times and begin to learn to feel (perceptually) the way they want to feel.

I'm confident that in 1000y, many many many people (I postulate nearly all) will figure out how to perceptually feel the way they want to feel and 1000y is also more than enough time to practise that enough to get connected and get temporal perception, upon which I think those guys will be hooked so they'll jump back into the timeline and fuzz theirself to perfection.

in the big picture, I think that lots of the authorised people will begin to try and make their way off-planet and begin to venture out into the galaxy, further increasing their need to keep what's happening out in space a secret, and so they'll probably build a whole setup just to keep humans confined to planet earth. the only way out is to find your connection.

so if I'm the antichrist, I figure that's probably the best "hell on earth" setup I can come up with -- though, I imagine many people will be having quite a good time in this "hell". it's all perceptual. you get to choose how you want to feel.


[1]: every manifestation amplifies emotion a small or large amount depending on the size of the manifestation, so if you feel dissatisfaction and something manifests, it may be able to make you feel physiclly better for a little while (pleasure), but that dissatisfaction never went away, and so after the tolerance to the pleasure starts to take effect, dissatisfaction will be stronger. most people experiencing this effect on drugs search for bigger and bigger highs to distract from the dissatisfaction.

[2]: the atlantian civilisation and the sumerians too, I believe used pyramids to bring space energy down to earth while at the same time producing a stronger and stronger atmospheric layer to prevent the solar rays in. this was combined with stone boxes to transform dissonant vibrations into harmonious ones, so for all practical purposes, they kept the planet's kundalini risen 100% of the time and controlled the manifestation of "bad" energies by transforming them into harmonious energies using conditions.

the idea of this one is to make a pretty big nova, which will eventually turn into a galaxy (like a quasar or something) -- however before that's done, a lot of weeds seeds need to be planted. when I say weeds, I mean those that are capable of thriving in more and more extreme conditions.

I think conditions on the planet will continue to become more and more extreme, and so the middle will eventually disappear, and the two major sides forming being the weeds (the ones that can feel good even though they have little control over their conditions) and the wheat -- these are the ones that need good conditions to thrive.

the whole objective is to let the dissatisfaction continue to rise. I beleive that the whole planet will be stabilised so that energy never rises to a high level and this will be accomplished by the antarctic civilisation. many new technologies will inevitably be created to keep the sun and its rays to a minimum here on earth (I heard bill gates wants to darken the sky -- stuff like that) because the sun's output is responsible for increasing psychic capabilities and other stuff. those effects will have to be mitigated by nosebook becauese they don't want their secrets getting out.

I think they've also been given the capability to edit the timeline as often as they want to, so they they sorta have two options: one is letting all of their secrets get out or continue to work on ways to keep all of that hidden. obviously they'll pick the second one, so that means they have to find a way to manipulate conditions all the way up until the sun finally goes nova.

I postulate that won't actually happen for another ~1000y or so and we're actually at the beginning of the 1024y solar cycle rather than the end of it. I don't really have any good way to prove this one way or another, and I may be wrong on some of the details, but I'm pretty sure that the goal is to let the sun power up for the next ~1000y or so.

you can see how this will be a large source of growing dissatisfaction because population will continue to grow (there's plenty of space), and I don't think many of the institutions installed are actually looking to try and accomodate that population.
