the idea of this one is to make a pretty big nova, which will eventually turn into a galaxy (like a quasar or something) -- however before that's done, a lot of weeds seeds need to be planted. when I say weeds, I mean those that are capable of thriving in more and more extreme conditions.

I think conditions on the planet will continue to become more and more extreme, and so the middle will eventually disappear, and the two major sides forming being the weeds (the ones that can feel good even though they have little control over their conditions) and the wheat -- these are the ones that need good conditions to thrive.

the whole objective is to let the dissatisfaction continue to rise. I beleive that the whole planet will be stabilised so that energy never rises to a high level and this will be accomplished by the antarctic civilisation. many new technologies will inevitably be created to keep the sun and its rays to a minimum here on earth (I heard bill gates wants to darken the sky -- stuff like that) because the sun's output is responsible for increasing psychic capabilities and other stuff. those effects will have to be mitigated by nosebook becauese they don't want their secrets getting out.

I think they've also been given the capability to edit the timeline as often as they want to, so they they sorta have two options: one is letting all of their secrets get out or continue to work on ways to keep all of that hidden. obviously they'll pick the second one, so that means they have to find a way to manipulate conditions all the way up until the sun finally goes nova.

I postulate that won't actually happen for another ~1000y or so and we're actually at the beginning of the 1024y solar cycle rather than the end of it. I don't really have any good way to prove this one way or another, and I may be wrong on some of the details, but I'm pretty sure that the goal is to let the sun power up for the next ~1000y or so.

you can see how this will be a large source of growing dissatisfaction because population will continue to grow (there's plenty of space), and I don't think many of the institutions installed are actually looking to try and accomodate that population.
