400y-bloom

the idea comes from the tick s02e06 - bloomsday. the idea is that there is a plant that will bloom every 400 years, and when it does, it needs to bloom "in the good way". the caretaker cites that last time the plant bloomed in a bad way, there were multiple catastrophes. I think the plant represents "Nature" so is the planet itself. the caretaker of the plan(e)t has to continually play music to the planto otherwise, it turns into a giant monster plant disaster.

I believe that during the rennaissance, conditions started to improve dramatically and there was probably a time split. some people were satisfied with the conditions that were around, but I believe that a number those that went off into the timeline of enlightenment, eventually found their way back here. I believe they used temporal (5.1) a YHVH (5.2) perception to produce foes that would sabotage their own enlightenment.

I also believe that it was even more than just a bunch of guys self-sabotaging, because I think the goal was to introduce enough self-debilitating concepts into the mainstream psyche that prevent humans from producing the technology that will cause enlightenment (like the cathedrals and pyramids) for another 400 years (modern times). we're reaching the point where that plant will bloom again.

I have taken the idea, and I like it, so what I've done with it is I've turned it into the 1000y-bloom. this concept is to give all the resources necessary to caretakers of the plants on the planet to ensure that it does not bloom for anther 1000 + 24 years, which I believe is the full extent of the solar cycle that can be used.

so I figure that the "landscape architects" will have all the capacity to move around and rearrange the plants that they need, preventing the plant from blooming another 1000y. it'll be the 1400y-bloom in total (btw, arthur's apt is 14B)
