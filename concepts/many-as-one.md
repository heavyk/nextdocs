morphic resonance
the idea that similarly minded species can "learn" and adapt though separated by considerable distance.

in the past, I called these concepts, and simply assumed that everyone in the species are tuned into the same concept.

when I write here, I can feel the people that are and will read it. they inevitably add their "reactions" to the concepts that I expressed here.

later on, when I go back to read the text, it appears foreign to me because it tunes me into a concept that has changed dramatically because of all of the reactions to it.

it's morphic because everyone accessing the concept alters it slightly. it's resonant because you access it by tuning to it somehow.

something like a song, a thought, or some text can provide the access point to the concept. this is the basis upon the idea of a ritual or incantation. if you know the "name" or the words, you can tune to the concept and you share the space with others tuned there as well.

so on one side I think it provides the basis for a library of concepts for a species to access, it can also be used for many other things too. it's the way I beleive the works of "shakespere" were created.

these are the lower levels/frequencies of the conceptual realm. at the higher levels, it gets so abstract that it looses lots of its ability to be translated into words or pictures. the higher frequency you go, the closer to source you get. source would be basically undetectable to us. it would look like "no signal" to us because it's so high frequency.
