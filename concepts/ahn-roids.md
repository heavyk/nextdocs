imagine a human being body that can be created/grown according to specification, meaning they can have any body shape and size. they come with a pre-installed set of concepts for how to interact with the world. they're basically like kids that will do anything you want them to do, follow orders, do tasks, and even perform creative things. they're entirely robotic in the sense that, like you DNA connects you to your physical concept of yourself along with other nervous system and brain signals, these machines are biological and are attached to a concept (soul).

given enough time, they *will* become conscious. if they start to misbehave, just terminate it or reload a prior concept for them -- cause like the concept will be constantly changing, so you can rewind their concept of theirself to some time previous, and teach them or treat them differently. in that sense, they're kinda like training-humans, because if you make a mistake with them, just rewind them.
