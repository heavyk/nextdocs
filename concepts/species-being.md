species-being is a term used by aristotle to describe the instinctual pattern of behaviour that's genetically hard-wired.

I call this the concept or the source of a person or species. a lizard instantiation (or plant, animal, etc) has a small brain which makes that animal individual, and that brain is involved with the animation of that specific animal, but the concept or source (instinct) exists out in the 5th dimension of conceptual space. when that concept is updated, all of the animals (or plants) tuned to that concept will have to adapt to use the new concept or they'll begin to lose connection to their source and a massive dieoff will occur. that concept will eventually produce a new instantiation that is compatible with that concept (so like lizard 2.0) and that lizard will contain different capablities.

you can imagine that not all animals are 100% clones of each other and so if there were to be a "perfect" DNA representation of that concept, the environmental factors alone would cause that DNA to degenerate in such a way that it begins to die out.

I belive that because conditions on the earth in the past were much less destructive to the organism, that's why organisms were able to grow so large in size, because they continued to grow for quite a bit longer before the energy deficit outweighed the growth.

a cell that divides into two cells is a cell that has an abundance and so therefore needs to split into two identical pieces. so if for example you imagine a cell like a string that's vibrating, if the cell is vibrating like it's source frequency, then the amplitude keeps getting bigger and bigger. to alleviate a runaway feedback loop, the cell divides into two. however, if the cell/string is vibrating more like it's environment is, then it's not likely in resonance with it's source, so it's unlikely that the cell will divide as often.

I propose that in prior epochs of this planet, the conditions here on earth allowed for certain ranges of frequencies to be amplified very easily (the frequencies that the stone boxes and pyramids resonated at), thereby allowing cells, likely the mtDNA portion in resonating at that frequency to be able to repicate much easier because of continued amplification.

since stone boxes and pyramids aren't the only source of energy on this planet, emotion (chi, prana, vril) at certain frequencies and the sun itself supports certain frequencies -- so, when a "solar regime change" takes place, many organisms no longer compatible with the new solar regime will lose their amplification.

this solar regime change is what jason is calling the "singularity" and what has caused the "y-chromosome bottleneck" and other things. many cells no longer compatible with the new frequency will find it harder and harder to continue to replicate. stone boxes and other things can only do so much to continue to support those organisms.

this singularity is directly related to technology, as for humans we're a species uniquely dependent on technology (tools) for existence, and so as we change, so will our technology (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/29hXsCWu7y8?t=865)).
