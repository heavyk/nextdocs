in the evolution-of-desire concept, I talk about how there are three stages to evolution of desire that I have noticed. the first one is need, the second is want, and finally the third is "I am".

the reason for this is simple. all desire that anyone has, it eventually resolves to an emotion. even if you *need* food to eat or air to breathe, you want to feel satisfied or alive. most people do not recognise the underlying emotion present in all desire, but I assure you it's there and this desire to feel an emotion is the real motivator of action.
