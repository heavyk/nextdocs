in the evolution-of-desire concept, I talk about how there are three stages to evolution of desire that I have noticed. the first one is need, the second is want, and finally the third is "I am".

the reason for this is simple. all desire that anyone has, will eventually resolve to an emotion. even if you *need* food to eat, you still want to feel the emotion of being satisfied. most people do not recognise the underlying emotion present in all desire, but I assure you it's there and the desire to feel an emotion is the motivator of action.

I say emotion because an emotion is more like a state of being than just a physical sensation. though it's common to think the physical sensation is the emotion that causes it, I am referring to the state of being when I say emotion.

I am the feeling I desire
