### 2022-12-01 11:10 - why hold out?

I didn't expect to write this now. I sat down to edit a new section and talk about [becoming epimetheus](/becoming-epimetheus.md). I wanted to share my experience in greater detail of how I understood (got) the fire of prometheus the other day. instead, it looks like I'll write this though. it feels to me like there is a connection between the two, but it feels superficial... I'll talk about it and see what comes of it.

epimetheus is all about memory and how remember our past. the way we remember our past is how we attract the future, and I'm about 100% sure that the coming upgrade to the human race (much like the last time of the atlantians), humankind is going through a transition in the form of memory, because it's all about conceptualisation. this upgrade is sure, certain, and has definitely already happened for me.

there is another coming upgrade that I can see on the horizon though, and I think it's worth holding out for. that upgrade is one that I've been developing on and off for at least a decade now, and that's my brain's capability to predicct things statistically. I know that some women do this (like patricia), with varying levels of success. it's the same for me too. I'm not very accurate with it, but as you can see with my "theories", I'm getting a new skill to be able to receive with clarity what I believe is the most likely situation to be happening with this thing that bothers me.

it is a double-edged sword, because I can pretty accurately predict a lot of bad things as being the most likely, and some of the things are unsolvable and out of my reach. because of that, I have to find a way to not let this grotesque thing happening somewhere that I'm sure is the most likely situation, to no longer bother me, and even in a lot of cases, see the advantage of it.

this skill, if you could consider all of my improvements on the feminine-mind, this one is the crowning achievement. I'm really quite proud of it. I'm not 100% sure it's ready for primetime yet -- and, like I said, once you can "see" all of the likely situations, prepare to get really good at not letting all the evils of the world bother you. you become, *really perceptive*, and once you learn to trust it, nothing can be hidden from you anymore.

sure, nosebook doesn't like that I have this capacity and they want to keep it under wraps, but trust me, it's awesome. there's the motivation. soon we'll talk about the "how"

### 2022-12-03 08:01 - I won't be able to do this...

once I get around girls, I'll completely adopt their thoughts and conceptual structure. conversation and in-depth analysis of things though non-visual memory will be greatly diminished, because it'll be tuned the things that they can visualise and conceptualise -- which is a lot less than what I can conceptaulise -- meaning, I'll be brilliant, but focused only on the stuff they can comprehend.

the beauty that I have now is that I don't have that, and so I receive a lot of incomprehensible ideas, and then turn them into speech and text like I do here. I really like talking about incomprehensible ideas. you know, every brialliant idea starts out for me as incomprehensible. I'm getting faster and faster at making sense of them, too.

### 2023-01-28 07:24 - it's just a question of time

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/f8nafVgHtZ8)

the song there [is originally by depeche mode](https://genius.com/Depeche-mode-a-question-of-time-lyrics) -- and it gives the illusion of a young girl(?) being raped or forced into submission by "them"... well, as usual, I take all lyrics and stories personally, and this one is no different. for me, "they" is nosebook.

    It's just a question of time
    And it's running out for you
    It won't be long until you'll do
    Exactly what they want you to
    It won't be long until you'll do
    Exactly what they want you to

even worse, I read it as: "it's just a question of lord chronos" -- and the idea here is that eventually they'll have my brain so well figured out, they'll be able to operate my body and get me to do exactly what they want me to do.

two major things to think about on that one: I want them to AND who is controlling whom?

from my perspective, it's all attraction, so from my perspective, EVERYTHING that is happening is attracted, so in my point of view, it appears that everything is happening perfectly as planned. as I mentioned various times, it seems exactly what I want to try and hold out for as long as possible; that's also their goal as well.

look at it like this: I'm completely in control, which means that *only* attracted things happen, which means, of the infinite possibliities of futures, only the believable and attracted ones are available to lord chronos to manipulate me within. it's getting to the point where I'm only experiencing wanted things happening (like finding this song, because I was just thinking at the end of the last song that I'm kinda wanting to write, for example).

within the spectrum of all of the wanted situations, they can choose for me to do exactly what they want me to do. I have no problems with that, *at all* :)

    Sometimes I don't blame them
    For wanting you
    You look good
    And they need something to do
    Until I look at you
    And then I condemn them
    I know my kind
    What goes on in our minds

in this song, gahn I guess is identifying himself with all of the other guys that lure young girls in. he disapproves of those types when it's them doing it, but when he sees her (the 15yo), he understands exactly what those bad-guys are seeing and how the desire affects their mind. that's the original meaning (and the poetic part about it is he says the concept backwards, from the perspective of being a victim) -- however, for me -- I see the same thing too. mentally I would consider myself easily capable of seeing from the bad-guys' perspective as well, but when he says "you look good and they need something to do" -- I consider myself as extremely attractive to nosebook.

I'm literally the most exciting thing that's happened for these guys for a long time. they're probably so used to damage control and generally trying their hardest to keep everyone under control, the concepts that I come up with are exhilerating. I've always got something new and exciting -- a new way for them to improve their "control" over us -- which sounds scary for them to have such control and power over so many peole, but in reality they can't make you do anything you don't attract. therefore, from the pro-attractor's perspective, they're only adding more energy into the situation, causing more wanted to happen more and more rapidly (even if it's also what they want -- it's still wanted for me).

where this song goes wrong I feel is in the last verse where he talks about condeming them. when the 15yo happens to him, he doesn't condemn himself because it's wanted, but when something wanted happens to someone else, then he condems them.

imagine for a moment that he's a dude that thinks he can only get something he wants by tricking a girl into getting her to do what he wants her to do -- well, he's attracting a girl that feels like she's a victim to men's desires or is in some way compelled by some other means. it's all attraction, so when they do finally have sex, the exchange will reinforce his own opinion that he can only get things by trickery, because she'll feel manipulated and tricked during the interacction, further reinforcing (through her perception of him) that he's a guy that manipulates to get what he wants.

we all attract things that reflect our percetion, so she'll go away feeling even more a victim to her circumstances, and he'll feel even more like he can only get what he wants my manipulating circumstances. we reinforce our own perceptions. that's the beauty of it all, because no matter how much nosebook tries to control me and get me to do what they please, they're only *reinforcing* my perception -- which, in my case is a *really awesome thing*.

for all of these reasons, I really see this as a good thing. I don't recommind fighting them, because it only reinforces your own victim of circumstances perception (they have control and I'm a victim of it), but to instead learn to attract wanted, and then nobody but you ever has control. the only thing they can do is pick between a multitude of wanted situations :)

it's better (IMO) for me to not want the manifestation and continue getting better at seeing/atrracting/noticing what I'm attracting, and find a way to make it look wanted. I manipulate how I perceive things much more than they can :)
