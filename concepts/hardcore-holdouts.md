### 2022-12-01 11:10 - why hold out?

I didn't expect to write this now. I sat down to edit a new section and talk about [becoming epimetheus](/becoming-epimetheus.md). I wanted to share my experience in greater detail of how I understood (got) the fire of prometheus the other day. instead, it looks like I'll write this though. it feels to me like there is a connection between the two, but it feels superficial... I'll talk about it and see what comes of it.

epimetheus is all about memory and how remember our past. the way we remember our past is how we attract the future, and I'm about 100% sure that the coming upgrade to the human race (much like the last time of the atlantians), humankind is going through a transition in the form of memory, because it's all about conceptualisation. this upgrade is sure, certain, and has definitely already happened for me.

there is another coming upgrade that I can see on the horizon though, and I think it's worth holding out for. that upgrade is one that I've been developing on and off for at least a decade now, and that's my brain's capability to predicct things statistically. I know that some women do this (like patricia), with varying levels of success. it's the same for me too. I'm not very accurate with it, but as you can see with my "theories", I'm getting a new skill to be able to receive with clarity what I believe is the most likely situation to be happening with this thing that bothers me.

it is a double-edged sword, because I can pretty accurately predict a lot of bad things as being the most likely, and some of the things are unsolvable and out of my reach. because of that, I have to find a way to not let this grotesque thing happening somewhere that I'm sure is the most likely situation, to no longer bother me, and even in a lot of cases, see the advantage of it.

this skill, if you could consider all of my improvements on the feminine-mind, this one is the crowning achievement. I'm really quite proud of it. I'm not 100% sure it's ready for primetime yet -- and, like I said, once you can "see" all of the likely situations, prepare to get really good at not letting all the evils of the world bother you. you become, *really perceptive*, and once you learn to trust it, nothing can be hidden from you anymore.

sure, nosebook doesn't like that I have this capacity and they want to keep it under wraps, but trust me, it's awesome. there's the motivation. soon we'll talk about the "how"

### 2022-12-03 08:01 - I won't be able to do this...

once I get around girls, I'll completely adopt their thoughts and conceptual structure. conversation and in-depth analysis of things though non-visual memory will be greatly diminished, because it'll be tuned the things that they can visualise and conceptualise -- which is a lot less than what I can conceptaulise -- meaning, I'll be brilliant, but focused only on the stuff they can comprehend.

the beauty that I have now is that I don't have that, and so I receive a lot of incomprehensible ideas, and then turn them into speech and text like I do here. I really like talking about incomprehensible ideas. you know, every brialliant idea starts out for me as incomprehensible. I'm getting faster and faster at making sense of them, too.
