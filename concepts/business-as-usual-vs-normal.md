business-as-usual is the regulation of *physical* conditions so that no major or upsetting changes inhibit "normal" operation.

however, when one is unable to exert much control over their *physical* conditions, the opposite concept to business-as-usual is having control over one's *emotional* conditions -- or, feeling-normally which is also feeling-purposefully. that is done by modifying one's perception to perceive the same things a different way, allowing them to feel the way the way they want to feel.

---

the connection between business-as-usual and feeling-purposefully can be found in the implementation of mutual-back-scratching.

when an exchange of physical conditions is made such as trade, exchange or any other type of barter, the desire is for the transaction to go smoothly without any fraud. for each side to get what their bargaining for, parties involved have to trust someone or something.

if fraud were eliminated, there wouldn't be any need to regulate of physical conditions (justified-back-scratching). unfortunately, we don't live in such a world.

certain types of people (perhaps they're just opportunists) see the regulation of conditions as an opportunity to leverage certain desirable conditions in exchange for others. this leads to corruption and leveraged-back-scratching.

I haven't fully figured out how to put it into words, but the attempt to maintain business-as-usual seems to be associated with the to greedy money/power grabbing types.

the connection here is likely within the regulation process. it feels to me like "need" rather than "want" (definitely not IAM) -- meaning, there is now is disconnect between the public appearance (of things operating business-as-usual) and what is really happening.

in order to maintain the business-as-usual appearance, they *need* things to go a certain way for everything to carry on as usual.

this puts the whole operation on the frequency of need, and will continue to attract more and more people operating from a place of need. this need will continue to snowball until the whole organisation (or person) must have (needs) certain conditions for survival or to maintain the appearance of everything business-at-usual.

the concepts I see associated to (and usually indicative of) business-as-usual mindset are: codependence, a strong empasis on appearance or marketing, and a heavy hand on ensuring that what is really happening is kept a secret.

---

business-as-usual tries to maintain an unchanging or stable appearance, when this goes against how things work. everything is changing and everything is in motion, so to try and maintain an "unchanging" appearance requires a lot of work. at some point, it requires nearly all of the resources of the person or organisation to maintain the appearance that it finally falls through. in my opinion, the attempt to maintain *anything* as unchanging is impossible.

death, for example is inevitable, so one is required to at least change physical bodies, at some point.

so, instead, what I'm talking about is not the physical conditions, because they are a reflection of the emotional/conceptual conditions, afterall.

---

ponder for a moment the predicament of a "fallen-angel". they have moved from body to body for thousands of years, yet desire to continue as "unchanging". their physical condions have changed many times, but it's more or less, the same thing. the thing that is unchanging isn't their physical conditions; instead, the way they feel/conceptualise reality, is what is unchanging.

[unfinished. it's hard to put this idea into words. I want to illustrate how they try to maintain business-as-usual in the physical conditions to hide that they're unwilling to change the way they conceptualise reality. they will point the finger and blame all sorts of things outside of theirself, endlessly. however, that's because they don't want to finally admit that they are the source of (attracting) all of the physical conditons that are *not* going as they should be (as usual)]

---

finally, now we come to the idea of feeling-normally. this is a complete reversal of business-as-usual.

the foundation of this idea is having control over emotional conditions rather than the physical ones. the whole idea is to strive to feel *normally*. that is, not feeling better than normal or worse than normal, but normal.

the idea here is that the way I feel normally *is* the way I want to feel. there shouldn't be any emotion out there that can make me feel too far from normal.

you may say, "well, then you're saying you don't want to feel good?" no, I'm saying, I want to make feeling good *normal*, and adjust my perception so  that all of the other bad-feeling things don't really make me feel so bad (because I can find a way to perceive them in a way that feels good).

---

in a sense, I'm saying that I'm taking the business-as-usual, and instead of continuing to let things go wrong and trying to pretend that they aren't going wrong -- it's more like continuing to let things go right and trying to make things going right all the time appear to others as just "business as usual" (normal).

another way to look at it would be to see how business-as-usual types usually are usually trying to cover up how they feel/conceptualise with *physical* conditions. instead, I'm trying to cover up my physical conditions with how I feel/conceptualise my world.
