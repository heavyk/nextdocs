business-as-usual is the regulation of *physical* conditions so that no major or upsetting changes inhibit "normal" operation.

however, when one is unable to exert much control over their physical control over their *physical* conditions, the opposite concept to business-as-usual is or feeling-normally, which is feeling-purposefully -- the regulation of emotional condtions -- that is, modififcation of one's perception to allow them to feel the way the way they want to feel.

---

the connection between business-as-usual and feeling-purposefully can be found in the implementation of mutual-back-scratching. in order for both parties to trust and the transaction was just, there needs to be regulation of physical conditions. regulation of physical conditions works well only if everything is fair and just (justtified-back-scratching) but, pretty often oportunists will see this as an opportunity, leading to corruption and leveraged-back-scratching.

I haven't fully figured it out, but the attempt to maintain business-as-usual seems to be always connected to greedy money/power grabbing. the connection here is likely within the regulation process. it feels to me like "need" rather than want (definitely not IAM) -- meaning, there is now is disjoint between the public appearance (business-as-usual) and what is really happening. they *need* things to go a certain way for operation to continue properly.

this operation on the basis of need will continue to attract more people operating out of need, and the cycle will continue. the whole organisation (or person) must have (need) certain conditions for survival or to maintain the thing being kept at business-at-usual levels.

the reason why this concept works is because *everything* is in motion. nothing really is still.

anything using propulsion that tries to keep going in the same direction (business-as-usual) will have to use more and more energy to propel itself forward. this is because the further you go out, the more rarified it gets and the less there is to push against to propel itself forward. propulsion requires one to push against something to move the opposite direction. this becomes more difficult as density decreases.

I'm reminded of a veritassium video of a guy riding a bike with the steering locked. in order to turn right, you have to first turn left. same thing with concepts. in order to go conceptually right, you have to first go conceptually left. it's never a good idea to spend a terrible amount of time going left if you want to go right, cause otherwise you'll just go left instead of right, or heading in the same direction you started initially.

the reason why this concept works is because *everything* is in motion. nothing really is still. if anything energetic tries to keep going in the same direction (like DC electricity), it will incur great losses, hovever alternating back and fourth between two opposite directions allows much higher efficiency and less power loss[^1].

[1]: I keep being reminded that power lines use high voltage DC transmission to incur only a resistive loss. I understand that's how it's done with wires. I wish to make my example understood without wires or metal conductors, but I don't know how to do it at this time. likely, we'll need a few more advances in our understanding of capacitors and propagation of energy through insulators before that's possible.
