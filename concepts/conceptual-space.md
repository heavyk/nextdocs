# conceptual-space

I've been noticing a thing the last few days where I seem to be able to "see" that all of us have our conceptual preferences (-1,1 interest) in relation to other concepts, and this is sorta passed around genetically. I also noted that this conceptual space (feminine matrix) is what makes the night the way it is. ever since I was in spain I noticed that the females domimate the night and the night feels like they do. I think this is because the sun is down, and the sun's conceptual matrix is a pretty strong signal, but when that signal goes away (ie during the night), emotion (especially for men, I think) the night becomes much easier to feel emotions and so therefore clearer thought is possible. the night is very different than the day, and the night with full moon is also very different. the moon also emits a conceptual space much more so when illuminated. the more lumionus, the stronger the conceptual signal (hence, the reason why planets' colours change and fluctuate, like mars presently -- jupiter is also brighter). the conceptual matrixes (concepts with high importance) are the signals that that affect a person in astrology. each planet values some concepts more than others and that affects us.
