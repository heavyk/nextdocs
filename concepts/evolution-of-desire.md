there are three stages to evolution of desire that I have noticed.

- need
- want
- I am


the need stage largely relates to physical necessities, such as food, water or oxygen. without these, the body does not feel vital.

at first most desire appears a need, however later a person begins to want things they do not need. wants can be mostly physical sensations, like sugar, alcohol, or drugs, but they can also be emotional.

it can be argued that things in the need category do not resolve to an emotion -- however, I believe that they do. it's upon this idea that I believe fasting (and other forms of deprivation are possible). most notable are the reports of the "breatharians".

once realising that desire-resolves-to-emotion, then it becomes obvious that all of the things anyone wants, material, circumstantial or otherwise, is because they want to feel an emotion.

I want a boyfriend (so I can feel loved).
I want a new car (so I can feel the newness of something).
I want a new job (so I don't feel depleted and worn out when I get home).

in order to allow that desire to manifest (or evolve), for me it's best to recognise it as the feeling rather than the object, circustance, or person that provides the feeling.

---

sometimes that identification can be difficult. someone may say something like, "I want someone to *love* me". well, that person knows the name for the feeling they want, but what does that actually feel like? what does that word "love" actually mean?

OK, "I want someone to *enjoy* me". that's much easier to work with. maybe, "I want someone to *appreciate* me".

the reason to figure out what exactly is the emotion that you want your desire to feel is to make it easy to feel that way now. I am certain that the universe that we experience is a reflection of how one conceptualises it to be.

it's very difficult to expect a desire to get you to a feel a way that you believe you are incapable of feeling. if you want someone to appreciate you, you have to find a way to appreciate yourself first. people are kind of like herds of animals in the sense that most people follow the example of other people's behaviour. if you don't appreciate yourself, it's pretty easy to imagine the other person will take your own example of how you treat yourself.

it's a vibrational universe, so if you pretend to appreciate yourself, expect people to again follow your lead and pretend to appreciate you, too. in fact, the physical manifestations of the things around you are usually such a good reflection of your concept of yourself, you only need to pay attention to how others treat you to get a good idea how you perceive yourself.

---

once realising that desire-resolves-to-emotion and that people will behave in your somewhat like a reflective of how you perceive yourself (it's only attraction), then the final step is to realise that "I am" my desire.

let's say I want something so I can feel productive. if I can feel productive now, then perhaps that and other things that also harmonise with feeling productive will begin to manifest in my experience. *I am* the thing I desire. when I feel the way I want to feel with the desire, then it's easy to see that all conditions, circumstances are just excuses for me to feel different than I feel now.

as I navigate those conditions and circumstances, they can cause me to feel a certain way -- or, as I feel a certain way, I can navigate those conditions and circumstances.

---

finally, the subject of "evolution" of desire is commonly associated with a certain set of circumstances or conditons manifesting as I had predicted they would. it's easy to see in hindsight that I expected those conditions or circumstances to make me feel a certain way. invariably (always), in my own life I have noticed on hindsight that if it had of manifested the way I wanted it to, then it would *not* have made me feel that way.

most people want the conditions or circumstances so they can show it off to their friends. if you want to feel like your friends admire your conditions or circumstances, find a way to feel how it feels for your friends to admire your conditions/circumstances.

it really is that easy.
