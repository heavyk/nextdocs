this concept is based on the "undesirable" path of the leapfrogging-time-pickles idea.

the basic idea is that whenever someone with temporal perception gets connected, you create the necessary identites and circumstances that are necessary to sabotage yourself and then jump back in to the timeline.

I think it's possible to do technically, but the way I'm talking about is perceptually -- meaning that if I want to create a new "dual" of myself, then I just do that and by dual will be designed to defeat me with my own shortcomings. there can be many many different instantiated opposing versions of myself, and they could easily be inserted into the timeline or switch the timeline such that the opposing versions of myself were always there. I just let source do all the rearranging around of the things so that it would be impossible to know that anything had ever been different (this new timeline *is* reality -- meaning it is real).

you win your own game when there's no longer any way for you to defeat yourself anymore. you are perfected

from experience, cause I'm basically describing what I think is happening in my own experience, it seems to build a reflex and an aversion to "getting connected" and/or having the kundalini rise. though I've seen the astral, I don't want anything to do with it. I believe this whole process has the objective of continuing to improve my capacity to feel the way I want to feel, even without the conditions.
