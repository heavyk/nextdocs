the idea is that I tune into a moment in my past and I put ideas into people's heads and my own so that I end up sabotaging some success that I have.

somehow the timeline has to advance to see the next set of events. again, I don't know the implementation details, but I imagine that I would set a trigger in the future to track my progress and if certain things are met, I abort the timeline and I wake back up in the future, make adjustments and then try again.

this seems like a lot of work, so it's more likely that I would do it perceptually. imagine that I do have temporal (5.1) perception... I could iterate on the timeline, modifying the concepts rather than the physical signals and stuff. almost certainly there's a way to do this without so much micromanagement.

after I've figured out all of the sabotages, I jump into the timeline. I experience more difficulty than I did going through the timeline to get to where I am when I jumped in, but the speed at which I arrive will be faster, meaning I'll have more expanded perception than I did before I jumped into the timeline. you are not your body. you are the aggregate of all of your experiences, so that means that "you" retain all of your "karma" between lifetimes -- so, each iteration, you'll gain a lot more expanded perception.

I do that enough times and I'll realise that the difficulty is that it's too easy to get connected. I need systems with greater and greater capacities to keep me from getting connected. I know I'll arrive to the present, so I need bad-guys with greater and greater capacity to sabotage me.

eventually, I realise I need to have a system whereby the "bad-guys" are actually able to prevent me from getting connected for an extended period of time -- like a long time. the more time, the greater the expansion.

obviously, this is untennable to do for any length of time. there is no way that any bad-guys setup would ever have the capacity to hold me for the entire time. therefore, it has to be done in sections. I think these sections are done in 1024y increments. each 1024y the "bad-guys" will have enough technology to ensure I don't easily make it to the next checkpoint.

the whole point, I think, would be to traverse the 1024y period over various lifetimes, and just trusting that it's all attraction along the way.

each time there is a successful run,
