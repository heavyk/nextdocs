the idea is basically that I live my life through, then at some point, instead of dying, what I do is I tune into a moment in the past. you set the length of the timeline by how far back you put it. it could be anything from hours to hundreds or even thousands of years. it also doesn't have to be your own experience. you can be born into someone else's circumstances into their same body and everything and live a very different outcome than they had.

for this concept I'm mostly going to focus on reliving my own life because that's what's important to me. I know I'll want to have a slightly different experience, and the easiest way to take a different path is to put ideas into my own head and influence a different set of outcomes. obviously, you'll collaborate with other people too, some playing the "bad-guy" for you and they'll influence you as well. once you've done that, you'll jump in wherever you want to start. you are guaranteed, no matter where you start, to end up in the place you're at "now".

### you can only receive the things you resonate with

people (including yourself) are only capable of receiving thoughts and ideas that they're resonant to, so you can't just send yourself some super great idea because you won't resonate with it, and so therefore won't hear it. you have to be "ready" to hear the idea. likewise, if you try to put the idea in your friend's head to steal from you, and your friend either isn't on that frequency, or does not wish to do it, they either won't hear it, or find the idea to be a annoying or weird and not think much of it.

### the desired path

tesla states that the two main paths are one of lots of affection or none at all. most people desire te feel affection from either self or from others. however, it's often the case that some people cannot possibly find a way to love and accept theirselves without having accomplished something. therefore, I find it quite probable that many people will optimise at first to build up a life where they accomplish some desirable things.

in the future, material things will gain more and more simplicy to manifest, so going back into your timeline to get the brand new tesla roadster before your friends is probably not what people will be optimising for. material possessions will be seen more as a utility to aid the manifestation than the manifestation itself. therefore, I find that most people from a future state of well-being will perceive the desired path, not as material possessions, but as experience and affection from others.

as an example, instead of being the first to *buy* the tesla roadster, what if you optimised your life such that instead, you figured out how to put the company together and offer the car to people. making the car available to others is much more awesome than just buying one. likewise, why not make something really awesome like a social network, a game, technology, operating system, or programming language with a lot of novel ideas...

you know, really -- whatever big idea that a "normal" person would think impossible becomes possible with this technique. you just have to find a way to get yourself "ready" for the idea. for some that's often some element of trauma or adversity. I read tesla's autobigraphy last night and I noticed how much emphasis he put on the difficulties he faced, NDEs, and other events that left a lasting impression on himself. he visualised the harnessing of the niagra falls in a simple vision as a child -- small things like that add up.

when arriving to the end of your timeline again after having achieved those great successes, you may want to throw it all into the rubbish heap and see what happens if you sabotage all of those successes. I personally recommend it, and I think this is my favourite part of this idea.

### fuzzing, the undesirable path

in this way of improving through experience what you want to resonate with, this path is the first path which I will call "fuzzing" (a technical reference of the same procedure).

the idea is simple: if the person don't resonate with the concept then, they simply won't receive it. so it's going to be pretty difficult to sabotage yourself with obviously bad ideas. you'll have to kind of figure out your own weaknesses and develop ways to exploit yourself.

#### attracting extra-ordinary events

you cannot just take yourself from some normal experience to something extra-ordinary -- whether that's unwanted or wanted. so, to cause certain things to happen, you'll have to develop the art of getting yourself ready for the catastrophe or the desired outcome.

I can't explain this cause every person is different, but small things add up, and the meaning that we give to those things also adds up. like, if you notice three bilboards with a woman with a red dress, you'll now be more likely to notice the woman in the red dress, even though previously she would have been off of your radar.

or, like maybe if you want to attract a catastrophe for yourself, worrisome friends are really helpful because they can plant seeds of doubt in your head which will grow into full disasters with every meaninbgful confirmation.

#### helpful character trait: down-to-earth

another thing to do is to develop character traits in yourself (in the present before jumping into the new timeline) that will allow you to interact more easily with a wider diversity of people that are capable of receiving and willing to aid you in your self-sabotage.

### implementation details

I don't really know the technical implementation details of this. I know that nosebook has a working version of this idea that they already operate. in that sense, they are my "authors", steering my life. I don't know how many people they will allow to use this technology though, so you may be "steered" by the authors for a while. it's no worries though, as it's 100% (no questions) *guaranteed* that everyone will eventually find their way to their connection and begin to do this consciously. I'm fairly certain that I'll be the first person to accomplish it -- meaning that I'll also be the last one too (too long to explain why... I'll get to it)

once you're doing it consciously you're using your temporal (5.1) percception to notice new things that interest you from that perspective and you select between the interesting things what you desire -- those things grow in magnitude feeling more and more like reality -- and then you're back in physical.

it's quite likely that nosebook will not want to allow anyone to modify their own timelines, as that could throw the sun out of balance -- and they're probably going to be doing a pretty interesting balancing act.

the new custodians will need to make this fine balance with lots of little manifestations that don't amount to much. their goal is to get people to jump easily to a cheap manifestation.

if you want to make your own timeline, you'll need to "not need the manifestation" for long enough to build up enough energy to find your connection to where they cannot sabotage you with your own manifestations.

### questions

#### is this working out your "karma"?

yes. actually, probably the best way to work out your karma. like I mentioned in other places, it's actually impossible to atone or compensate for every last jot or tiddle, because that would mean the universe is now coherent and you resonate with all of it. that's not going to happen until the end of infinity, so basically never.

in a system of compensation, all things that anyone has done, need to be "compensated" for, which is basically means you're just attracting on that subject, and you get to decide how you perceive it. it could be a wanted manifestation or unwanted. it's your perception that decides how you "compensate". if that signal caused 100 units of unwanted manifestation, that signal now needs to cause 100 units of wanted manifestation, and only you can decide how to perceive that signal. you decide what part (unwanted or wanted) is amplified/compensated.

#### how does it work?

when looking at things through temporal (5.1) perception, the things that are popping up are concepts, and their becoming reality is a strong focus -- a point of attraction. that point of attraction is a point in time and space that you will arrive to in the physical, no questions asked. that trajectory can be altered to include more of one concept and less of another, etc. all paths toward that point of attraction are valid, just some appear more valuable or desirable depending on what sort of things are meaningful to you.

#### why, once you're doing this consciously, will you be both the first and the last through your own timeline?

the first thing to realise is that if you're doing it consciously, then the body and the lifespan no longer matters. it's just an attractor at a position in time and space. there are infinite paths over one or many lifetimes to get to that point that you defined consciously.

see @[leapfrogging-timepickles](#how-does-it-work)

after that now it'll be easy to see if we run through an example.

let's go back to when I was born and say that I'm going to relive kenny's live over again. last time I had some good conditions and I found my alignment and I consciously became able to jump back into the timeline and do it over. every time that I do it, I find my alignment faster and faster, which is no good. it's getting too difficult to sabotage myself. I need to come up with technology and or bad-guys that will sabotage me real good and prevent my connection.

the first phase (leader) is to go through the timeline and setup the difficult situation for yourself and live out a comfortable life with good conditions where I'll jump back in for the second phase. tho goal here is to make sure the bad-guys have all of the things that they need to prevent my connection for some extended period of time, preferrably over various lifetimes.

once those bad-guys have such a difficult system in place (be it religion, technology, or something else) that completely shuts down the person's capacity to realise they're a spiritual being (basic custodial crap), I can jump back in to the timeline again.

the second phase is to make it through the timeline again with all of the extra difficulty setup by the new custodians. this will be all of the basic stuff I said about figuring out my weaknesses, sabotaging myself, turning that into wanted and getting myself ready to not need the manifestion again (alpha).

once I've made it through the new difficulty there as the alpha. it's time to go omega: the third phase. now that I'm assured to arrive to the end, I sabotage myself to ensure that I don't get there with any of the conditons that the alpha got there. this new path of self-sabotage creates a completely new concept of how to arrive to something a non-traditional (unexpected way). the omega is reborn and the cycle repeats.

old ideas:

I figure that there will be two main optimisations that:  affection
- none at all
and I put ideas into people's heads and my own so that I end up sabotaging some success that I have.

somehow the timeline has to advance to see the next set of events. again, I don't know the implementation details, but I imagine that I would set a trigger in the future to track my progress and if certain things are met, I abort the timeline and I wake back up in the future, make adjustments and then try again.

this seems like a lot of work, so it's more likely that I would do it perceptually. imagine that I do have temporal (5.1) perception... I could iterate on the timeline, modifying the concepts rather than the physical signals and stuff. almost certainly there's a way to do this without so much micromanagement.

after I've figured out all of the sabotages, I jump into the timeline. I experience more difficulty than I did going through the timeline to get to where I am when I jumped in, but the speed at which I arrive will be faster, meaning I'll have more expanded perception than I did before I jumped into the timeline. you are not your body. you are the aggregate of all of your experiences, so that means that "you" retain all of your "karma" between lifetimes -- so, each iteration, you'll gain a lot more expanded perception.

I do that enough times and I'll realise that the difficulty is that it's too easy to get connected. I need systems with greater and greater capacities to keep me from getting connected. I know I'll arrive to the present, so I need bad-guys with greater and greater capacity to sabotage me.

eventually, I realise I need to have a system whereby the "bad-guys" are actually able to prevent me from getting connected for an extended period of time -- like a long time. the more time, the greater the expansion.

obviously, this is untennable to do for any length of time. there is no way that any bad-guys setup would ever have the capacity to hold me for the entire time. therefore, it has to be done in sections. I think these sections are done in 1024y increments. each 1024y the "bad-guys" will have enough technology to ensure I don't easily make it to the next checkpoint.

the whole point, I think, would be to traverse the 1024y period over various lifetimes, and just trusting that it's all attraction along the way.

each time there is a successful run,
