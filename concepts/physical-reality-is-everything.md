is is the materialistic perspective, that physical matter and reality is all that there is. we know from NDEs and other things that consciousness is non-local, meaning not confined to the human body in either space or time.

it does beg the question why then if consciousness is not bound by space or time, then why do we incarnate into the physical?

I personally believe it's so experience things go wrong. when you see something unwanted, that same frequency also contains the vibration of what is wanted -- only the perspective of unwanted is traveling away from wanted, while the perspective of wanted is travelling toward it.
