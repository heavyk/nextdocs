another borrowed concept from BOTS. it's the idea that no one has the answers and we're all just figuring it out as we go.

so, to verify to yourself you don't have all of the answers, you print for yourself your own certificate of ignorance.

---

the important deeper meaning to this is you're printing your own certificate of ignorance, and only you can do it. if other people tell you you're ignorant, you'll usually defend your ignorance. other people are simiar, meaning that they have to find a way to print their own certificates. you can't print it for them.

---

the second important deeper meaning (for me), is that if nobody has all of the answers, then that means that talking to other people about things usually will only get you ignorant answers. it's possible that someone could have some insight, but ultimately that path to discovery is yours and yours alone. don't wait for other certificated (or not) ignorant people to give the *right* way, or answer.

ideology is not your friend.
