# comitragidy - absurdity of theatre

in this study, I wish to outiline different aspects of a new perspective on plays: the juxtaposition and contrast between common conceptions of tragedy and how absurd they are (once one understands how we create our own narrative of reality, with our concepts of it, of course)

### elements

- waiting for something to never come
- humanity's vain hope for salvattion
- meaninglessness of life and the endless struggle of existence
- suffering is an inseperable part of the human condition
- born without wanting to be born
- die when when we're not seeking to die
- purposelessness of life (and who/what gives a "real" sense of purpose)
- desire as a precursor to destruction

### motivation (motives, motifs)

- time: discomfort of inability to control its passage or affect the events occuring in its passage
- victimisation of oneself to fate and destiny
  - both fate and destiny should be explored as different concepts, in contrast to willpower (ie which one is actually willpower cause they both seem to victimise the tragic hero):
    - destiny as being unavoidable but changeable
    - fate as avoidable, but determined(?), so therefore has consequences.

### message and morality

- portrays characters as thrown into this world as a diseased animal, and that their consciousness is not the cure but the torment/misery.

### comedy

- miserable disposition of characters
- attempts to perform the absurd
- naivate of one's own miserable condition
- games and simulation (play within a play) where the games theirselves illustrate the elements in more amplified way
