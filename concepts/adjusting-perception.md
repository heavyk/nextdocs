### adjusting-perception

any time that I notice negative emotion or a desire in relation to someone else (I want their car, their girl, their whatever) or desire in opposition to someone else (I don't want them to have this. they shouldn't be rewarded for something that they did) -- those sorts of things, then here's my technique attempted to be put into steps...

#### 1. feeling cause (external why)

first, I like to look at what it is is that causes me to feel bad about such a thing. to do this, I often imagine the "worst case" scenario playing out and notice the way that you feel, and then figure out what are the reasons why you feel that way.

as an example, let's say I'm watching someone that I feel competition with getting everything that they want and I'm left with nothing. after looking at that worst possible situation play out, I may notice some sentences come up like, "she always gets her way", "she always gets everything that she wants", "he doesn't have to work for anything", or "everything always comes easy for him"

#### 2. recognise myself (who, what, where)

second, I figure out what those sentences mean about how I perceive myself. I'm identifying the reflection of myself in the other person.

continuing the example, it may be something like "I'm not able to get my way (the things that I want)", "I don't believe that things can come easily for me", "I have to work really hard for everything". these are different sentences that describe me rather than the other person.

that is how I really see myself and I've removed the other person now from the whole thing.

#### 3. why do I see myself that way (internal why)

third thing now is, why I think those things about myself? these are going to reveal the underlying reasons (we have so many reasons and jusifications for our beliefs, this is the easiest part). they're usually really simple (perhaps illogical or irrational) things, so don't worry how silly they are.

continuing the example, I want to ask myself, "why don't I think that I can get what I want?"

the answer will probably be something like "I've always been told I can't" or "I'm not good enough" or "she's better than me", but that's bringing the other person back into the equation again. "I'm not good enough" is what I'd be looking for.

whatever the reasons are, I'm now starting to arrive at the core concept of myself. you'll notice that most of those outer layers are programming by culture, society, parents, etc.

#### how do I want to see myself? (how)

then, from there I can begin to make changes to how I see myself. I can begin to say something like, "actually I am good enough to have this", "you know, there's no reason why I couldn't have this", "maybe I am good enough", etc.

I keep working my way up there with every person that I interact with where I feel any amount of competition or dissatisfaction with them, until it becomes easy to just recognise and assimilate any any every aspect that I don't like in another person.

as I do this, I noticed that at some point (I don't know when), anything started to feel effortless.

#### late-game techniques: evolution-of-desire

when things start to become effortless, I noticed that it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that I still need manifestations to make me feel good. in reality, what I'm really after is not the manifestation, but actually I enjoy assimilating and improving upon so many other aspects of others personalities, that it's that which becomes intoxicating -- not the manifestationss.

this process is the evolution-of-desire format, where I notice that it's not a manifestation of things outside of me which I need or want, I AM the manifestation that I'm lookin for. everything that I interact with is ultimately a reflection of me, so I want to actually like me.

#### late-game techniques: allow it to become automatic

the more I do this, the process happens more and more automatically. not only do I recognise the bad-feeling quicker, but I change it almost instantaneously so steps aren't really so necessary. I don't try and direct it so much but just go with the flow of the improvement faster and faster. in fact, I nociced the faster I can change my perception, the less resistance I have.

one may think that allowing it to become automatic feels like losing control, but I notice how good I am at feeling myself in relation to my surroundings, so even if I have to change my perception again, it's fine. it's not like I'm locked into new perception any more than I was to the old one.

#### late-game techniques: receptive or assertive

I also start to notice meta trends in my improvements of perception. every single thing that makes me feel bad about something in relation to someone else is *directly linked* to a perception about myself so I see myself in everything now. that is a very receptive form of perception because I allow all things ("good" and "bad") to be things I'm receiving into my reality.

some things seem to reoccur over and over, and these things we often times associate with a gender. the reason why they keep happening is they're part of my identity and so I need them to continue to exist in the form that I perceive myself now.

regarding the gender, this seems to be most often related to receptive or assertive aspects of myself I'm noticing in others.

so for this example let's just say I'm heterosexual and so I like my opposite gender (apply your own gender preferences as you see fit).

I when I notice aspects in another person that I want for myself, if they're of opposite gender, I feel strong attraction to them. however, if they're of the same gender as me, instead I feel competition and negative desire for them (as in, "I don't want them to be successful with that attribute").

I've noticed (but it's not always the case) that the gender that I feel threatened by is often the gender that I'm weakest in. I also believe that this is the underlying reason why generalise genders...

so, for example it's often for someone to feel difficulties and competition with *other women* if they are not very good at being receptive. oppositely, someone will feel difficulties and competition with *other men* if they're concerned with to have power, influence, or dominance. we tends to notice our own deficiencies in others.

after getting pretty good at his, I notice now that if I see something that I like in any person, regardless of their gender, I feel strong attraction to them. it's totally OK for that to be happening. it just means I'm got really low resistance and I'm pretty much only looking for the wanted aspect now.

#### tl;dr

it all comes down to is noticing the part of yourself that you don't like or that you want in another person and figuring out how to modify how you feel about yourself to assimilate that new aspect. you can get good at this and do it very rapidly and easily with a little bit of practise.
