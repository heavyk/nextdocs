similar to evolution-of-desire but for concepts. for evolution-of-desire, the evolution comes when a manifestation does *not* happen. this is just the opposite: the evolution of a concept happens with each manifestation (physical and sometimes imaginary implementation) of the concept.

a concept is, as plato describes it, an "ideal" having none of the limitations imposed by the physical realm. that concept then, through some way becomes a physical manifestation. the most common way to produce a manifestation of a concept is biologically with sexual reproduction.

a concept is a frequency, so it resonates with other similar concepts and two (or more) concepts can be added together to create a new concept. an undesirable aspect of a concept can be subtracted just as easily.

resonation of one concept with another attracts similar or compatible ideas to it, and so in the process of creation, it takes "time" (eg. suitable amount of interactions) for the concept to attract to it the necessary components to become a stable and viable concept capable of reproducing itself.

concepts are unbelievably similar to biology, and so I postulate that genetics and biology are the physical manifestations of the conceptual world.

it's said that everything has a "source" which I liken to something like the nucleus or proton, which contains all of the information of that physical manifestation in the form of a concept (a very high frequency), and in a lot of ways, a macro scale verson of the proton seems to exist in the biological world in the form of DNA. they're resonant vibrating system going through a sequence of state changes as they interact with their environment (ie. the inner reflects the outer)

so, the way to evolve a concept is to manifest it into the physical and then let it die. it's often said, "keep your ideas to yourself until they're fully developed" and this is because an idea that has not been given proper time to gestate and attract all resonating (missing) components.

one way to think of the attraction process for a concept is to think of "destructive interference" in a signal sense. when two signals intersect, they cancel each other's signals out. that energy does not go away, instead it simply transforms into another type of energy. without having a good name for it, I think of this type of energy as "non-physical" energy -- and it's a world composed of the vibrations of every impact and destructively interfered signal. because the ratio of these non-physical signals are so much greater than the physical ones, we can think of this ratio of non-physical to physical signals like the quantity of space to atoms, planets, stars, galaxies, etc. -- there is a LOT LOT more space (or non-physical vibration) than there is physical matter (physical vibration).

so, as a result of this space created from the missing components to a concept, that vacio attracts a corresponding vibration. in the physical world, this is the difference between anti-matter and matter -- and the conceptual world isn't a whole lot different. with the passage of time (ie. the continued interaction/impacts of all of these non-physical vibrations), that vacio eventually gets filled in with the appropriately resonating concept, and it's finally ready to manifest, and will do so, naturally.

to force an evolution of the concept, translate it into physical with words, thoughts or effort to make a stillbirth manifestation (something dead on arrival) or something that has a short lifespan and dies rapidly. don't worry because that death is what evolves the concept, strengthening the attraction of the vacio to the concept. the death still exists in the non-physical world of desire (1) and structure (3) and its rediscovery will be easily accessed at the frequency to which it has evolved to after its death.

a real-world implementation is suggested in evolution-of-species.
