based on the evolution-of-concept concept, this attempts to explain this evolution process in the biological sense.

I've only read a very little amount of biology (I'm literally going through macroevolution.net right now and its what inspired this document) -- so I know very little about about the physical implementation of biology, and so inevitably some of these ideas will need updating...

I suspect that DNA is a resonant device, and it's not just a singular frequency. I believe that the DNA folds in various ways to adjust this frequency, and also I beieve that the oxygen components store a charge which affects the amplitude of that part of the signal. I wrote up a whole lot of ideas on how I think the physical implementation of DNA could be working (like what states cause the signal to go left right or straight in the junctions), but the basic idea is that each folded version of the DNA tunes the cell to a concept, which then physically attracts the protiens it needs to become a fully functioning cell.

I also don't believe that a cell is ever in a single state, and transitions between states at a relatively high frequency. this frequency of state transitions I think is affected by your mood (ie. the way you feel, which is the signal being produced by your heart, which is a composition of your throat and solar plexus -- top of your stomach?). state transitions are likely also produced by environmental effects like EM radiation, magnetic fields and things like that.

so, you could think of each state as a frequency (consider this like a note or a colour) and then the whole sequence of state transitions as a song or a "living colour" (to me, concepts have a living colour associated with them.. they transition rapidly between different colours making them appear to be alive and in constant motion). when looking at a cell, just based on its colour or sound (depending if you're visual or auditory), one can readily see (or hear) how harmonious the cell is with its source concepts.

so in a large way, I would say that the physical DNA is only something akin to a programmable antenna. it's the concept in what I would call the conceptual plane (5) that acttually contains all of the "code" for the state, and it's in that code which our thoughts and ideas have an effect. this is likely why mood and mentality have such a dramatic effect on health.

I still have a pretty serious disconnect between getting that idea above of the physical (7) connecting to the conceptual which is the evolution-of-concept (5), and the evolution-of-desire (1). it appears I'm missing the structure portion of it all, which will cause a cell to remain a cell and not become something else.

I discussed this idea elsewhere, but did a bad job at it still, where I described cell division as happening when a critical amount of energy forces a portion of a cell to "return to its source" and in the process of that energy returning to its source, the structure of the cell resists that energy's return creating a copy of itself.

in the physical plane, this returning to the source is the death process, which is why I believe so many tremendous leaps in the evoutionary process have happened with reborn-deities and in massive cataclysms.

so, one thing is to explain how a critical mass of excess energy causes the concept to return to its source, which in the process creates a copy, but I don't yet see what happens in the death process which allows that evolution to happen. I do know that when something dies, it releases it's physicality, and that releasing of it's physicality is sort of like the destructive interference and it makes its immediate transition into non-physical as the negative physical frequency, which then, attracts component vibrations until it is ready to manifest again (as explained in evolution-of-concept).
