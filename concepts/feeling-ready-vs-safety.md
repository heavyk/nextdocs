I really dislike to do things until I feel ready to do them. there is a feeling that I get when I know that I can do something. I may not know how I'll do it, but I'll figure it out. I feel like I can do it.

I had always thought of this ideas as safety, but it's not. it's more like readiness than safety.

readiness and safety are very similar concepts but they rotate in opposite directions.

TODO: I'm trying to think of a way to explain the idea but it's difficult. readiness feels like preparation to move while safety feels like security while moving. I'm also realisingt that they're not exactly 100% opposite because of different people's definitions of the words for readiness and saftety -- so I'll have to define them on my terms for the concept to work.

safety involves risk. readiness doesn't worry about the risk. the risk is always present, but a feeling of readiness means that the risk does not feel like enough of a factor anymore to prevent motion.
