# feminine-mind

I've been talking about it a lot. time to dedicate a concept to it.

[TODO: intro on what I believe it to be]

### 2022-11-07 12:40 - default behaviour instinct

a few days back I had a few interactions where I would relay to mom what greg was thinking in a playful way, and then relay back to greg what mom was thinking also. this comes from both of their non-confrontational attitudes toward each other. they hope it'll get better automatically, but at the same time they believe differently. they *know* that mom/greg will keep doing what they're doing (parking the car close to the door, or leaving messes around, etc.). this situation is pretty much the same as an expectation; one part desire (I want them to not do this), and one part belief (which you know you're right about how much they do the opposite). the question here is how do I confront the other person to get them to not do that thing that's annoying (for me, it's how mom seems to seemingly deliberately interfere with my planting). I could confront her, but I know it won't help, because it really has more to do with me.

it's easy to see it from a LOA perspective and see it all working out flawlessly, but the other day, I was asked how I would respond to a situation similar to greg/mom's. I didn't have an answer then, because I know that if I try to get them to do any thing, it's a bit like assertion and I pay the price for that on the rebound[^1] but the thing that I noticed is that this kinda is encoded a bit into what I'm gonna call the feminine-mind (I'll try to update a few older entries to use this concept).

some people choose to be very confrontational, meanwhile others consider it something very undesirable. I believe that our feminine-mind actually encodes that confrontational people are bad. this explains to me the reason why I notice that a lot of really business-types seem to feel deep down they're bad people, because they're confrontational -- meanwhile, other people desire to be told what to do. so, the tellers of what to do become automatically in our mind labeled as bad.

I notice that I personally don't ever like to tell anyone what to do -- and, the only time that I ever do it is in reaction to something. the reason for this is that if I tell someone what I want them to do, I'm creating one of those energy things that comes back to me[^1], so I too am one of those non-confrontational types.

so, for example, I caught myself building up those beliefs with mom and the planting thing, so I just wanted to explain what I'm doing here because this is essentially how you reprogram your feminine-mind. it's very simple, so let's just walk right through it. brb

[1]: energy expelled always comes back to me, and the way that it comes back to me is a reflection of the environments that it passed through (ie. physical air, someone's mind, to someone else's mind, to a whole society, to whatever...) I think of this like karma, and the quality (actual vibration, not the amplitude/magnihude) of the energy will produce in me what normal receipt of that energy will do to me (pain, pleasure -- all physical sensation and anything between, up to desire). in short, energy comes back to me depending on what I sent out and how the environment/others reacted to it.

first, I'll give the LOA (conceptual) perspective of the thing, which is that it's easy to have a problem with something, but it's not as easy to have a solution to it. I personally believe that I have a solution to everything that I have a problem for, so in order to get that solution (the physical one, not the conceptual one), I have to get into the receptive mode for ideas to come to me that will allow the present situation to change to something different.

---

OK, now, let's talk about how that same thing is now seen from the [non-]confrontational (physical) perspective. when I see a problem that someone else is doing, and they do it every time. well, that's the time to see if I'm going to get confrontational about the problem. I actually recommend no action, or if it's important, clean/do it myself -- because if I can feel good about doing/cleaning that thing, then I'm fine, and I can allow them to begin to do things differently because now it's less work for me to do.

### 2023-01-12 14:48 - saturn's effect

one of the things that stood out to me in the sirian guide was that it said that saturn was a solmn/somber individual, and women loved him because he evoked their maternal instinct in them. I have noticed that this is true for a lot of 4th rays. as such I've started to notice these saturnian 4th ray individual types all over the place, marcos of course being the first.

anyway, as I start to gain more effect, that maternal instict will shift to be more like mine rathar than the maternal. anyway, I was also thinking about the helena character in shakespere's plays, and how his writing added new forms of interaction and concept of reality for them (you know, besides the ones the culture, family, religion, etc. installs). to some extent I've noticed that helena is kind of a difficult character to play -- or that there is some confllict around difficulty -- where, helena just sorta goes against their programming, and she feels terrible to them, and so because of the way helena feels to her, the less likely it is for a woman to actually behave 100% like helena. you know how hollywood and the media puts out these pictures of the celebs in perfect form, when the reality for someone to look like that is much more difficult, they're sorta like putting the media-imposed false standard of what is to be feminine, masculine, gay, straight, african, white, etc. these books and stories define how it is for us to behave.

helena was a difficult character that a lot of female actresses (actors?) struggled with and that creates desire. any time in a play where you have these extremely eccentric, but believable characters, it's kinda like a pissing contest to figure out how to act in character for some of these extreme characters.

anyway, another thing I'd like to mention is that I think helena is often played by a boy, so you can imagine from a woman's perspective she sees him playing the part so convincingly, and then she even sees it hard for herself to do, there must be some problem. OK, so let's go over this.

I believe that feminine instinct was originally programmed by vulcan, and this is what is true of the legends of him creating pandora and her box. so you have to understand, this is nick bottom, and zero girls are capable of being such a glutton for punishment like he was, so the part appears impossible to play from the female standpoint (because one should avoid, hide, run away, reprimand, punish, etc, that kind of behaviour -- it feels like a schism making unsure the way considered to be the way a woman *should* act. see? it's like mental chaos -- this is desire -- that's what it looks like). ... those schisms add up, and what they eventually do is produce actors and people capable of playing that part. think about how this is like a time portal for summoning players that want to play these parts. these players, although 5th ray in perception, because of their acting, are forced into the manipulation of the 7th. they're kinda like little girls in that they're fumbling around with physicality, but on the conceptual/feeling level, they're quite advanced. derailed. lol.

anyway, it's eventually going to happen that femasles will start to figure out what I see, so saturn's effect (as programmed by vulcan), will take on a whole new appearance. a whole lot of helenas will appear, nearly overnight.
