# feminine-mind

I've been talking about it a lot. time to dedicate a concept to it.

[TODO: intro on what I believe it to be]

a few days back I had a few interactions where I would relay to mom what greg was thinking in a playful way, and then relay back to greg what mom was thinking also. this comes from both of their non-confrontational attitudes toward each other. they hope it'll get better automatically, but at the same time they believe differently. they *know* that mom/greg will keep doing what they're doing (parking the car close to the door, or leaving messes around, etc.). this situation is pretty much the same as an expectation; one part desire (I want them to not do this), and one part belief (which you know you're right about how much they do the opposite). the question here is how do I confront the other person to get them to not do that thing that's annoying (for me, it's how mom seems to seemingly deliberately interfere with my planting). I could confront her, but I know it won't help, because it really has more to do with me.

it's easy to see it from a LOA perspective and see it all working out flawlessly, but the other day, I was asked how I would respond to a situation similar to greg/mom's. I didn't have an answer then, because I know that if I try to get them to do any thing, it's a bit like assertion and I pay the price for that on the rebound[^1] but the thing that I noticed is that this kinda is encoded a bit into what I'm gonna call the feminine-mind (I'll try to update a few older entries to use this concept).

some people choose to be very confrontational, meanwhile others consider it something very undesirable. I believe that our feminine-mind actually encodes that confrontational people are bad. this explains to me the reason why I notice that a lot of really business-types seem to feel deep down they're bad people, because they're confrontational -- meanwhile, other people desire to be told what to do. so, the tellers of what to do become automatically in our mind labeled as bad.

I notice that I personally don't ever like to tell anyone what to do -- and, the only time that I ever do it is in reaction to something. the reason for this is that if I tell someone what I want them to do, I'm creating one of those energy things that comes back to me[^1], so I too am one of those non-confrontational types.

so, for example, I caught myself building up those beliefs with mom and the planting thing, so I just wanted to explain what I'm doing here because this is essentially how you reprogram your feminine-mind. it's very simple, so let's just walk right through it. brb

[1]: energy expelled always comes back to me, and the way that it comes back to me is a reflection of the environments that it passed through (ie. physical air, someone's mind, to someone else's mind, to a whole society, to whatever...) I think of this like karma, and the quality (actual vibration, not the amplitude/magnihude) of the energy will produce in me what normal receipt of that energy will do to me (pain, pleasure -- all physical sensation and anything between, up to desire). in short, energy comes back to me depending on what I sent out and how the environment/others reacted to it.

first, I'll give the LOA (conceptual) perspective of the thing, which is that it's easy to have a problem with something, but it's not as easy to have a solution to it. I personally believe that I have a solution to everything that I have a problem for, so in order to get that solution (the physical one, not the conceptual one), I have to get into the receptive mode for ideas to come to me that will allow the present situation to change to something different.

---

OK, now, let's talk about how that same thing is now seen from the [non-]confrontational (physical) perspective. when I see a problem that someone else is doing, and they do it every time. well, that's the time to see if I'm going to get confrontational about the problem. I actually recommend no action, or if it's important, clean/do it myself -- because if I can feel good about doing/cleaning that thing, then I'm fine, and I can allow them to begin to do things differently because now it's less work for me to do.
