the basic idea here is that I don't ever really want to feel better than I do normally. instead, I want to stay right around normal range for me, and let normal range be pretty high frequency (feeling pretty good). it's unsustainable to feel amazing for any length of time. trust me, I really liked my 3-5 day MDMA bingers, *a lot*, but I also like feeling that good normally. same with girls: I like the idea of feeling really good when a girl is around, but I really like the idea of feeling that good normally.
