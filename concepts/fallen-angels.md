this is roughly the same as bramley's custodians.

I haven't totally figured it out, but I've come to believe that humans were created very similar to the way I postulated I would evolve my own race @[newblog](2022-01-18 01:14).

the basic idea is that I would first create a bunch of angels that embodied all of the things that I don't like about myself (my "dual"). they would be conceptual entities/programs that would project theirselves downward into astral bodies. they would be put into circumstances where they could take over the power structures of of the civilisation on the first planet (mars). me and my team would then move our consciousness into the tech team of that matian civisation. we'll soon design the species which will fit into the box (soon to be fallen) angel's concept of reality.

after taking over the power structures, the envirenment is now beginning to reflect their concept of reality -- so starting to go into ruin. they'll jump right into business-as-usual so as to not alarm the rest of the people on the planet that they're destroying it. they'll involve the tech team to build structures to alter the physical conditions of the planet (like pyramids and stuff). on the second planet, they will find with suitable living conditions and a number of hominid species that also contain the conceptal programs of "wanted" aspects I want for myself (the species) -- however, they inhabit bodies far too primitive for the expression of those wanted attributes.

some disaster will happen or maybe the tech team will get tired of building things and so slaves need to be made. the tech team will mix the genetics of the hominid species with the "gods" (martian) DNA.

another disaster (attracted by the angels of course) will happen which will make mars incapable of habitation. they have to move to the second planet (earth) and live among the humans (slaves).

a third disaster will happen (also attracted by them) which will make access to the conceptual no longer capable (kali yuga), and these angels are now trapped in the astral realm. they notice some hot babes and want to have sex, so they decide to inhabit physical bodies. they are now "fallen angels".

they inhabit the astral (4d) by nature, so when they die, they return to their astral body and can fly around and find another suitable (physical) body to inhabit.

they have been doing this since the beginning. because they do not wish to release their consciousness (what we would think of as death), they decide to keep moving from body to body.

for them, physical reality is all that exists. the conceptual reality still exists and is present, but because they're so disharmonious to their "source" concept, they're unable to get back to it.

because they were built with the idea that they never want to change how they perceive reality, which is all the unwanted stuff I don't like about myself, they continue to try and convince the new species which we (the tech team) built and are inhabiting ourselves, to conceptualise reality like they do.

as a result, these fallen-angels, are basically there for us (the original tech team now also inhabiting the slave bodies) to find a way to return back to the conceptual view we have of ourselves. the fallen-angels are given all the resources that they need to continue to convince everyone that their concept of reality is the right one.

they are the custodial influence here on earth.

it's kind of a backwards way to create. the concept of wanted-and-unwanted-are-same, so instead of trying to build a species containing only wanted, why not instead create a set of controlling "custodians" that try to ensure that the new species and every aspect of the world they live in reflects the version of reality that they have.

then, obviously, each time that we figure out how to make reality in a way which is incompatible with their concept, a split *must* occur.

I believe this same mechanism is what causes cells to split. there is a contrived problem, which produces many slightly different replicas of the solution.
