the idea here is that instead of creating a race based on wanted, I believe that the human race is to create what is wanted naturally. in order for wanted to emerge naturally, one must instead create what is unwanted (the contrived problem), and then let LOA and the natural evolution of desire create the wanted aspect.

in this system, the "genetic algorithm" is optimising the bad-guy, rather than the good-guy. the bad-guy creates the "hostile environment" whereby the creation finds ways to get around the effects of the bad-guys (or join them). each iteration, the baddest bad-guys are selected for their bad-guy fitness. only the strongest and toughest survive.

because of the way LOA works, under normal circumstances, the bad-guys would destroy theirselves, but because they serve as the "hostile environment", their continued survival is supported by the species that they are evolving.

the bad-guys are not the creative ones; they follow rules and datasets of physical conditions, and try to convince the good-guys to do the same.

the good-guys do not rely on physical conditions for their survival; instead, they create their own realities; they are the creative ones.

the bad-guys rely on the good-guys for their continued survival. the good-guys utilise the limited physical conditions that the the bad-guys  control for continued continued expansion of new ways to overcome those conditions and create something wanted.

[[[incomplete: I'm still unsatisfied with my explanation of how they depend on eachother. if you have what you want that is, things are "perfect", then you need to feel dissatisfaction to create something new. it's hard to explain this concept from a physical perspective. instead, imagine that everything is perfect, and all wanted.. what would you want from that perspective? you would want some amount of change]]]

the idea here is that the fallen-angels are conceptual beings that have "fallen" down to the physical plane where they control physical conditions, forcing change. humans are physical beings that are prevented from accessing the conceptual plane by the fallen-angels. this prevention builds desire for us to return "back to the Father" so, each time we figure out a way back to feeling the way we want to feel, the genetic algorithim (the "christ") separates the good-guys from the bad-guys and picks the best of each then runs the simulation again.

a long time ago, I asked the mushroom what "christ" is, and they told me that the christ is essentially LOA inside of our brain to optimise efficiency. it will continue to attract more and more intense situations (good or bad). the idea is that good-feeling requires less energy than bad-feeling, and so you are forced to optimise for the ability to attain physical conditions which can produce good-feeling (less energy), or the ability to change one's perception such that one can produce good-feeling even in the midst of bad conditions (ie. first paragraph in @[dtp/dtp](chapter-1-23)).

> I believe you close to me, and time will make, easier to find my way; I believe you stay or leave, and time will make, easier to find my way; easier to find my way, easier to wait and stay, easier to no mistakes, easier to find my way (song quote)

the idea here is that we all have this "christ" built into us, the one that optimises the attainment and control of physical conditions to produce good-feeling, vs. the manipulation of one's perception to produce good-feeling.

I have placed this "christ" in the relational/pineal (2) centre and communicates to us via the astral/imagination/regenetive (6) centre. it divides the way between one's physical/objective reality and the emotional/conceptual/subjective reality. mentally, it divides the way between one's desire (need/want/IAM) and one's structure (logic/path).

the both the physical/objective (7) and the spiritual/conceptual/subjective (5) planes rely on one another.

from a concept you can project (create) a temporary physical reality that feels how the concept feels.

or, you can use physical conditions to create (project) temporary feelings that are similar to the conditions that created them.

everyone inside of a negative-evolution creation, no matter what all has a source (even the "fallen-angels") and every iteration, gets to decide which way they want to go: 1,5 or 3,7.

I imagine that for most of the time, the quantity of those that want to return to their source (the 1,5 path), are very few -- maybe just like one guy, but it's possible that there could be more -- many more. each time someone stays, that means there is still more to create because desire is still to stay away from (out of alignment with) their source.

I imagine that the whole creation is "perfected" or "complete" when the whole creation returns to it's source. the more stubborn the fallen-angels are with their unwillingness to return, the more iterations of creation are possible. if the whole of creation were to return, I'm sure someone creative -- a trickster of sorts -- will always come up with another contrived problem though, so it almost certainly never ends.
