# alpha-omega

there are tons of places scattered about where I've pontificated on this topic, so they could eventually be merged in here...

when I think about the alpha/omega as the beginning and end of something, especially here on earth where you're only fighting yourself, the alpha-omega is also only fighting theirself, as well. to get this, I'll place myself in the alpha-omega's position: I want to create something, so I create a system of "reality" -- a sort of matrix, in which we all use to understand reality. that matrix is essentially a reflection of own sense of perception, and comes with all of the same flaws and faults that my perception has. let's just assume a "virgin" earth without any previous resistances in place that will contradictt the new matrix, meaning that it's a near perfect reflection of my perception. that system grows and grows, eventually stabilising into a power structure designed to keep its form of perception alive.

that growth will always have some amount of deviation from its own form of perception, meaning that it'll eventually succumb to internal strife and beligerance. that rebellion is what eventually gives birth to the next alpha-omega -- the "one" that is able to get around the efforts of the previous power structure to survive. inotherwords, if the creation is virgin, then the first is the alpha, and then after that, all the rest are omegas, cept the one that is *actually* able to overthrow the previous power structure and establish a new one. (I'm writing this sexually on purpose, to give the idea that each conquesting man establishes his power structure that then has to be overcome by the next man.)

therefore the alpha-omega system is a binary one, one of king/ruler/owner/principality that maintains the current power structure, and then the hopefuls, looking to try and overthrow that power structure and establish their own. each successful conquerer goes from being an "omega" to an "alpha" upon conquering, ad inifnitum.

I only used myself as an example to illuminate how dissimilar I am to the alpha-omega, in that I'm not looking to overthrow or conquer anyone. however, I do in a lot of ways do contain a few of the alpha-omega concepts, though, from my perspective they're the *result* of my interaction, not the *reason* for my interaction. I don't really want to overthrow anyone.
