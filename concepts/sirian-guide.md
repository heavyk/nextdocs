### intro

the sirian guide is a document that I found when I was in berlin. I have no recollection of how I found it (I was probably drunk), and upon reading it, I felt immediately as if I understood how reality works. I didn't revisit it again until probably 2015-2016 at marcos' house (I remember reading it by the pool), and it felt very confusing to me.

this document is quite interesting. it really blows my mind how very different I perceived this document each time I read it. the document was perportedly written a year after my birth, in 1984. I take quite a fascination in all "inspired" works -- because each time I read them, my own consciousness has shifted, so tuning into the concept with the words, I see, hear, or read new things.

### my history with the document

the document says to famialiarise yourself with the rays, so you can figure out which part you were playing. I always figured that I was vulcan cause he has a limp left leg and creates weapons (social networks) for zeus (zaryn). however, I also felt that I wanted to find myself in other rays too.

my memory of the document was very bad and I got a lot of things mixed up -- most notably sanatau and saturn. in berlin I perceived patricia as unessa because she was so logical and structured. she said she had a boyfriend, so I figured he would be sanatau and I would be thoth. later on, at marcos house, I thought that andrea reminded me of anatau (first two letters match anyway), so that would make me jerotau and marcos, saturn.

I had no idea what in the world all of it meant. I never really thought about it much but, I guess raquel fits very very well as a (-6), but I never thought about her that way. for some reason I always considered her as a (-2). at that time I didn't remember the SECOND RAY triad, so I never associated her with isis until literally just now.

those other relationships fell apart, and I knew I was vulcan so I was on the lookout for "aphrodite" (I couldn't remember the name of genxicat) and mars. finally after returning to the states for a while I had a look at the document again (maybe more than a year ago) and all of it looked like complete gibberish to me. I left it again.

I finally came back to the document 10-11 days ago and I found out that I was way off on a lot of things... see @[newblog](2022-03-10 22:16). since then, it's aroused a desire in me to actually figure out what they're trying to say. over the last 11 years I had taken their document and formulated my own version of their septinary ray system based on perception (7-layers-of-perception).
