### I cannot end your fear

I cannot end your fear.
you see things assulting
you, everywhere you look.

your vision is clouded
by the things you hate.

you're taking out your wrath
in attempts to understand.

look into your future, what do you see?
look at your problems; why do you see me?

I can't take away your fear; only you can do that
I can't take away your pain; I already tried that
I can't take away your past; you're the one bringing it back
