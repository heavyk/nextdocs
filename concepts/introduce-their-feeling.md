this is the idea of affecting someone else to feel (emotionally or physically) the way that they emotionally or physically feel. most commonly it is the transferrence of conceptual energy from one person to another. it's kind of like reverse empathy.

I've found that this happens most strongly during sex, and the most energy is transfered goes from the female (or bottom) to the male.
