# maxine-foot-dragon

there are two types of cosmic foot-draggers: the ones that want to improve their technique and the ones that don't (sedintary realities)

maxine is one of those, depending on the type of anti-novelty it needs.

it also inspires a fictional character in my mind. it's a beautiful little girl. she's elegant and has a lot of wisdom to say, but her foot has a mind of its own and looks like a dragon. it's very hard for her to get the dragon to cooperate enough to walk, sometimes.
