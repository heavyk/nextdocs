#### we would have to reimagine a new form of society

I don't think so, and this is the wrong way to look at it. look at it from the outside looking in. I'll come back to this.

imagine you are one of those societies that want to keep humans from gaining PK and psi capablities, so they suppress the quality in us. I think this is already being done on a mass scale, and unless you're initiated (keeper of secrets), you don't get in.

my goal is not to try and fight them on their level. I figure sure, my vision will never be able too see very far, it is constantly improgving. though my imagination doesn't show a picture, I'm learning to "see" it without the picture.

that's really a good thing because I don't directly access the concept that the symbols in the picture encoded, I can perceive it as any concept I choose, rathar than having the image dictate to me the concept for me to see.

I must be pretty far along in it because I really see really far symbolically, and so while I may have poor eyesight I have incredible forethought.

OK, so now saying that I'm saying that a new form of society isn't necessary because nobody will get access to their psi (unless initiated into the club). that means that the majority of society isn't in there, which means that nothing needs to be rethought. we can just evolve naturally and at each their own pace.

what I'm saying is that literally all paths lead toward the source at this point, so if you made it this far, you're guaranteed to arrive. you can't get it wrong, so it doesn't matter what you end up doing (perceived good or bad).

it's like if you told your friend he is certain to to get to the other side, so therefore he has unlimited doovers to jump over something until he gets it. maybe he'll rest on trying to figure it for for an eternity, it doesn't matter because he knows for certain that he definitely will arrive. que pedo wey.

#### why isn't psychical research leading to a revolution?

I think this has to do with those that don't want us on that plane of existence. they have rules, like no tesla technology, but you don't need tesla technology or anti-gravity. electrostatics can do many other very similar things (we just have to think about it in frequency so it could be attracting or repulsing).

think about a fly's feet how when you look at him you'll notice that he does not touch your skin. he hovers just above you, so we could just do what the insects do. there's no restriction on that and dosen't need PK or anything abstract or temporal to work.

#### the spectral revolution demands a complete restructuring of society

I would agree, but I may interject an idea in here, because notice that the power structures in place today don't have much power and they're losing more and more all the time, they have to get all the holes plugged, which means they won't be the dominant power structure.

if you look on the horizon (though perhaps we're already pretty well into it), you'll notice that marketing and image has much more sway on the concepts that we use. other online platform as well. they want to limit the number of concepts we think on in a day. you'll notice that there's nothing to do. the spectral revolution has already happened. we're just playing out the implications of such a society now.

what I'm saying is that it already happened (we moved to sales and marketing, which is like a crippled form of concepts), and so we're just now beginning to see that play out in all sectors of reality.

if you contemplate that idea you'll notice that the concepts that the spectral revolution will be perceiving will actually be hijacked. you'll see the sale exterior of the conecpt, rathar than what you actually see the concept as (or maybe not at all if they want to hide it).

society doesn't need restructuring if we just go another matrix deep.

if you look a little further, you'll also notice that all of those big advancements that are coming for us in this spectral revolution will only be what a marketing person can see in it (access to more material stuff). so the restructuring of power into the hands of the best marketers, the whole thing has limited itself to only see the things the material perspective can contemplate.

### we may see an AI with extrasensory perception

this is already present in AI. the more "black box" (don't understand the logical process/formula of input to output), then the easier it is for consciousness to go in there and rearrange the bits, the more that you will be talking to a consciousness.

in fact this reminds me of an experiment that I wanted to do where you do basically a seance and call in a spirit to influence the values in a neural network.

anyway, what I wanted to say there is that it already exists, and the more complexity increases, the more we will be interacting with consciousness itself.

### a select few being the progenitors to a new species

... at the expense of the many.

I don't see it that way. I think whatever is marketable will become what's available. there's no expense; just something to buy.

---

it's obvious that this will occur at the beginning to where only the "elites" have it, but it won't be too short beyond that when it becomes commercially available.

then the next stage is that just the rich can have it, but competition will drive those prices into the floor just as technology gets better and more productive.

what I see is that these sorts of commercially available products will *rapidly* got put into the marketplace.

as I said, all of the same things that can be done with tesla technology can also be done with electrostatics; we just have to think about the same thing, but in the opposite way.

#### time travel

I don't think it'll be possible for anyone in this 3d perspective. it's possible to time travel from a 5d perspective, but I get the feeling that 4d (the astral, not spectral) is pretty well locked down. like, no unauthorised people allowed there, so all time travel will eventually be controlled.

to get to 5d is a bit interesting because time doesn't exist in the linear form that our imagination produces for us (you see a model of the world the best your sensors can interpret them with other concepts), so that world doesn't have any of the sense organs, except for the 6th (sense). eventually you start to see the reality around you in the form of concepts, even though you only see in 3d.

if you want into 5d, you have to be really good at feeling the way you want to, because the appearance that other 3d beings sees is the translation of the concept that you have of yourself.

---

so, in my opinion, the spectral is the revolution where everything becomes a spectrum and you just float around in experience (which gets turned into concepts). from that nebulous cloud of concepts, you have a general sense of everything that is happening in reality, but you don't necessarily see asy of it directly. all concepts that make it in there got past your filters. you can also put algorithms and other conscious attributes to the concepts that you interact with there. que pedo wey.

#### are you the demiurge?

as I listened to the rest of it, it felt like I was listening to chris talk about some really bleak subject. I wonder if you yourself aren't one of these "narrators". your narrative is interesting, and it serves as a good demiurge.
