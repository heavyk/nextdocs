### 2022-09-15 19:04 - 003 - spectral revolution

#### we would have to reimagine a new form of society

I don't think so, and this is the wrong way to look at it. look at it from the outside looking in. I'll come back to this.

imagine you are one of those societies that want to keep humans from gaining PK and psi capablities, so they suppress the quality in us. I think this is already being done on a mass scale, and unless you're initiated (keeper of secrets), you don't get in.

my goal is not to try and fight them on their level. I figure sure, my vision will never be able too see very far, it is constantly improgving. though my imagination doesn't show a picture, I'm learning to "see" it without the picture.

that's really a good thing because I don't directly access the concept that the symbols in the picture encoded, I can perceive it as any concept I choose, rathar than having the image dictate to me the concept for me to see.

I must be pretty far along in it because I really see really far symbolically, and so while I may have poor eyesight I have incredible forethought.

OK, so now saying that I'm saying that a new form of society isn't necessary because nobody will get access to their psi (unless initiated into the club). that means that the majority of society isn't in there, which means that nothing needs to be rethought. we can just evolve naturally and at each their own pace.

what I'm saying is that literally all paths lead toward the source at this point, so if you made it this far, you're guaranteed to arrive. you can't get it wrong, so it doesn't matter what you end up doing (perceived good or bad).

it's like if you told your friend he is certain to to get to the other side, so therefore he has unlimited doovers to jump over something until he gets it. maybe he'll rest on trying to figure it for for an eternity, it doesn't matter because he knows for certain that he definitely will arrive. que pedo wey.

#### why isn't psychical research leading to a revolution?

I think this has to do with those that don't want us on that plane of existence. they have rules, like no tesla technology, but you don't need tesla technology or anti-gravity. electrostatics can do many other very similar things (we just have to think about it in frequency so it could be attracting or repulsing).

think about a fly's feet how when you look at him you'll notice that he does not touch your skin. he hovers just above you, so we could just do what the insects do. there's no restriction on that and dosen't need PK or anything abstract or temporal to work.

#### the spectral revolution demands a complete restructuring of society

I would agree, but I may interject an idea in here, because notice that the power structures in place today don't have much power and they're losing more and more all the time, they have to get all the holes plugged, which means they won't be the dominant power structure.

if you look on the horizon (though perhaps we're already pretty well into it), you'll notice that marketing and image has much more sway on the concepts that we use. other online platform as well. they want to limit the number of concepts we think on in a day. you'll notice that there's nothing to do. the spectral revolution has already happened. we're just playing out the implications of such a society now.

what I'm saying is that it already happened (we moved to sales and marketing, which is like a crippled form of concepts), and so we're just now beginning to see that play out in all sectors of reality.

if you contemplate that idea you'll notice that the concepts that the spectral revolution will be perceiving will actually be hijacked. you'll see the sale exterior of the conecpt, rathar than what you actually see the concept as (or maybe not at all if they want to hide it).

society doesn't need restructuring if we just go another matrix deep.

if you look a little further, you'll also notice that all of those big advancements that are coming for us in this spectral revolution will only be what a marketing person can see in it (access to more material stuff). so the restructuring of power into the hands of the best marketers, the whole thing has limited itself to only see the things the material perspective can contemplate.

### we may see an AI with extrasensory perception

this is already present in AI. the more "black box" (don't understand the logical process/formula of input to output), then the easier it is for consciousness to go in there and rearrange the bits, the more that you will be talking to a consciousness.

in fact this reminds me of an experiment that I wanted to do where you do basically a seance and call in a spirit to influence the values in a neural network.

anyway, what I wanted to say there is that it already exists, and the more complexity increases, the more we will be interacting with consciousness itself.

### a select few being the progenitors to a new species

... at the expense of the many.

I don't see it that way. I think whatever is marketable will become what's available. there's no expense; just something to buy.

---

it's obvious that this will occur at the beginning to where only the "elites" have it, but it won't be too short beyond that when it becomes commercially available.

then the next stage is that just the rich can have it, but competition will drive those prices into the floor just as technology gets better and more productive.

what I see is that these sorts of commercially available products will *rapidly* got put into the marketplace.

as I said, all of the same things that can be done with tesla technology can also be done with electrostatics; we just have to think about the same thing, but in the opposite way.

### 2022-09-15 20:24 - 004 - the end of all things

#### time travel

I don't think it'll be possible for anyone in this 3d perspective. it's possible to time travel from a 5d perspective, but I get the feeling that 4d (the astral, not spectral) is pretty well locked down. like, no unauthorised people allowed there, so all time travel will eventually be controlled.

to get to 5d is a bit interesting because time doesn't exist in the linear form that our imagination produces for us (you see a model of the world the best your sensors can interpret them with other concepts), so that world doesn't have any of the sense organs, except for the 6th (sense). eventually you start to see the reality around you in the form of concepts, even though you only see in 3d.

if you want into 5d, you have to be really good at feeling the way you want to, because the appearance that other 3d beings sees is the translation of the concept that you have of yourself.

---

so, in my opinion, the spectral is the revolution where everything becomes a spectrum and you just float around in experience (which gets turned into concepts). from that nebulous cloud of concepts, you have a general sense of everything that is happening in reality, but you don't necessarily see asy of it directly. all concepts that make it in there got past your filters. you can also put algorithms and other conscious attributes to the concepts that you interact with there. que pedo wey.

#### are you the demiurge?

as I listened to the rest of it, it felt like I was listening to my friend chris talk about some really bleak subject all the time with me. it blew my mind how he had such a bleak outlook on reality (I pretty much think, cept for the years I was depressed, that everything is always getting better). I don't see the technological singularity as a problem because everything you consider concerning, I believe will be completely locked down. a fully managed 4d is the new 3d.

I see chris as one of these narrators that has passed through my life to help me choose the most believable worst possible manifestation. I wonder if you yourself aren't one of these "narrators". your narrative is interesting, and it serves as a good demiurge.

### 2022-10-04 03:46 - 002 being bound for freedom

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/-7IVciE_YKQ)

in this one you talk about how it's necessary to have free will and how a universe where all possibilities are known, does not allow for free will (or freedom). instinctually, I tend to disagree with this idea and that is on the subject that if your free will or decisions *create* the many different possiblities, then that's a different story. I'd like to illustrate that idea here.

in my present situation, let's say that there are a finite set of situations that can decide to take, in my singular perspective, I choose to take any one of these circumstances, and you're right that all possibilites are already known and accounted for. however, what if I make a realisation that I want to do something *new* -- something novel. now I have the finite set of circumstances that I had previously, plus a few more. every time that I come to the realisation that there is another new previously unaccounted for way to go, then I'm doing something novel.

if the universe is, in fact, looking to account for every possible path through reality, then it's goal is to try and come up with circumstances that will produce novel realities -- ones that were not previously thought up with beforehand. I believe the mechanism for this is something I call "desire", and that desire is actually what drives this creative process.'

desire, in its purest form is to be able to accomplish what one believes to be "impossible". that seeming impossibility wants to find a path toward something a condition, state, or realisation of oneself that was previously incompatible with the previous condition, state or realisation of oneself.

as an example, if my conditions is cold (cause I'm outside in the snow), then the "impossible" is to find a way to feel warm even in the snow. or, if my state is depressed, then the impossible would be to find a way to feel esctasy or contentment, in spite of such circumstances. or, if my realisation of myself is a poor person, then the impossible would be to realise myself as someone successful, or as a planet or star.

it's possible that those other realities could exist in the example of the condition or the state, because there very well could be another parallel universe where I'm out in the snow naked, but for some reason, I don't feel the cold. this would mean that I either have some superhuman capability, or the "laws" of physics are somehow behaving differently there. in either of those cases, it's still my conscious perception of myself (my capability to feel warm despite the conditions) or my conscious perception that nature should in fact behave a little bit differently than it's used to behaving (habit).

in the case of a different state, you could imagine a parallel universe where the conditions are exactly the same, but instead of depression I feel esctasy or contentment, but then why would that be? am I forced to emotionally feel the way that my conditions (and my perception of them) imposes me to feel? imagine one person that grew up with barely anything and someone leaves them a crappy car as a gift, and it's like the best thing ever for them -- however, for a pretty well-off person, who gets left a crappy car left in their front yard finds that same situation to be highly annoying and a waste of time. do all of those infinite other universes include all of the minute variations in my own perception as well?

the real interesting case is the case of my realisation of who "I" am. I wake up in the morning and I realise I am the body that I seemingly inhabit, but is that body "me"? I claim that it is not. therefore, what if one day I wake up and I realise that I am the planet earth and I see reality from earth's perspective. is that also one of the parallel universes? let's say it is, so then we should be able to imagine that every single entity associated with the planet earth (vibrationally sympathetic) also has that same alternate universe. what if I wake up and realise myself as the universe? quite literally everyone (and everything) else in the universe has that same alternate universe as well. what in the world would happen if I could find a way to realise myself as something that this universe does not already contain? are all of those infinite possibilities already accounted for by such an omniscient "God"? I claim no.

---

the way that I look at freedom, is not one so much of conditions, but instead of one of state or perception. if I'm in a different emotional state than the circumstances would dictate that I should feel, then I am superhuman and no longer within the confines of the precalculated set of possible universes in the multiverse. the other factor that gives me freedom is one of percepion. when I look at a piece of art or any set of conditions, it's my freedom to perceive those conditions or those brush strokes (or sounds, etc.) in a way in which the artist did not intend, or that is outside of other's range of perception. that perception is itself novel, and outside of the realm of the calculated multiverse and will ultimately alter my trajectory through time and space. this is what I think is the intent of your idea for novel folklore. novel perception (of myself, conditions, or emotions) is freedom.

---

I have an additional set of ideas to add on to the promethian concept of being bound (to the caucuses mountains) for freedom. it involves the idea that perhaps that story is actually the original idea behind the concept that your only true freedom is, the way that you feel, and how you perceive reality -- because if that weren't the case, prometheus wouldn't have choose to experience that reality in the multiverse. he must have known that it's all perceptual. I'll expand on this idea in the future, because the very story of him having some awful conditions (the bird pecking out his liver) tells of the fact that prometheus was not actually bound by his conditions. his conditions should have produced a different result, so if you believe any portion of that story to be true, we're already on a novel timeline.

### 2022-11-14 20:01 - 007 phenominal authorisation

I don't have too many comments on this one. I pretty much am in agreement with most things said, but I'd really like to pay some attention to the voice in which it's done.

the majority of the first part of the essay gives a lot of examples, but from the perspective that things are being done *to* the person -- that they're somehow victims of some "noble lie" or any other machination. this is not the case. it's all attraction.

as an example, let's consider plato's proposal of the noble lie of the lottery to eugenically create superior people by pairing them with optimal partners. that may be the case genetically, but consider the possible effect this lottery could have: a lot of the elites did this eugenics stuff, which is why there were so many arranged marriages and inbreeding -- and it produces an immense amount of unhappiness and conflict. they may have had genetically superior children, but at the cost of a terrible childhood and family life... yay

---

the way that I look at attraction is that your life kinda reflects how you feel and how you conceptualise your reality (ie. how you *think* it works). this means that happy people tend to lead a life of a lot less conflict. seems logical, but it's not obvious for most.

so, while it may *appear* that the noble lie is producing something better, but it's actually producing based off of it's initial impulse. what I mean is -- imagine the guys that are sitting there coming up with this plan -- and they're thinking to theirselves, "man we have a bunch of physically and mentally inferior people" (not-good-enoughness) and so they decide to implement this eugeics program disguised behind the lie. although they may be able to get physically improved genetics the first few generations or so, but I guarantee you that unhappiness will continue to rise amongst people that are not emotionally agreeable, and only physically agreeable. I guarantee you that after a few generations, the original problem ("man we have a bunch of physically and mentally inferior people") will get worse. the mental one is easy to see, but the physical one not as easy to see because you are in fact getting more physically "superior" people.

well, if you've ever been involved with sports, gymnastics or other competitive activities, you have a lot of physicall very confident people, but when it comes to actual performance, you'll find that statistically the ones that feel better will consistently do better.

you may get better genetics, but you probably won't get get better performance (at least, not in the long run, anyway).

---

the other thing I'd like to comment on is that this whole essay is all about "phenominal authorisation" -- in which, the "authors" of our reality authorise phenomena to occur by allowing these phenominal events to occur in the narrative (they're jusified), but I would like to point out the method by that makes this possible, and you will see that *you* are the authorisor of *all* phenomena that can happen in your experience.

when you read a story or some other symbolic arrangement of characters, you engage the story with emotion in order to give the symbols some life and character. because you engage with emotion, you ar allowing events that feel similar to manifest in your reality (it's all attraction), and so when you read a story, the author "authorises" these events to occur through a series of emotional jusifications leading up to the event. they're usually justified, and if they're not they're left unexplained, leaving the reader/watcher to come up with the justification theirselves.

the most insideous types are the ones where there are vague reasons for the passage of certain events, and so therefore you leave the reader to try and find the reasons (like blind owl, hehe) -- and by doing so, the reader finds theirselves in similar dreams and experiences. I know personally that I completely stopped watching movies and books with magic in them, because they would "authorise" these characters to interact with me in my dreams. no thanks.

---

just as a side note, I'd like to mention that I had a friend like liked these types of characters a lot (he reminds me a lot of you actually), and I personally hated them. in the end, I ended up going the opposite route, where I tured to psychedellics instead where, instead of interacting with these "authorised" entities, I preferred to interact with aspects of my own psyche instead. I much prefer my own machinations to others. my machinations are far more diabolical and make a whole lot more logical sense too (better justifications). and yes, those machinations of my mind extend out into the physical reality world.

sometimes I wonder if I invented the archons because I was bored.

#### 2022-11-14 22:20 - followup: emotions and summoning of a conceptual/egregore reality

I noticed a few reactions to what I wrote, which is nice because it allows me to talk about something for a bit now, namely the conceptual. plato calls this the world of forms. to understand it, consider that there isn't a single physical car that can perfectly match the concept of a car. there are many many instantiations of the concept of a car and no single one contains all of its aspects. that's the first maxim.

next, let us consider the difference between words of expectation "I expect you to do this" (though you may not), and a feeling of expectation like a forboding feeling. in conjunction with that, cosider the difference between words of belief ("I believe this") and the feeling of belief (what I'm looking at is real).

you will notice that the effective kind of belief and expectation are the emotional ones, much more than the word ones. this is the second maxim.

finally, let us consider the process of summoning an egregore: there are different ways to do it, but what they all resplve down to is the creation of a *belief* in a concept/spirit/entity. that entity does not yet have form, much like a character in a novel, until of course you begin to put form to this character in your mind. at some point, the character becomes so real that you can interact with it as if it were real (like old king hamlet). it only has form in your mind though. only in your mind can you feel like this concept is a reality where you can interact with it.

that belief has to be externalised so that something you believe only exists now can exist in a different (denser) medium, the one of physicality. the process of doing that is roughly the same way that you "authorise" your reality: you feel it -- meaning you believe/expect it.

I tried to put emphasis on the difference between *saying* you believe/expect something and actually feeling it, because it's important. like an athlete, the more you practise your routine in your mind, the more used you get (in your mind) to feeling your reality manifest in a similar way. the way that you feel your reality to be (kids are so annoying, never do their work, housemate is irritating, etc.) and we blame most of the things that we ourselves *expect* to happen in reality on the other people.

you say, well, it's hard to believe something else, because they've always done (that thing that annoys me and that I expect them to do). of course, and it's a good thing, cause without it, the process of improving yourself by visualising your own behaviour differently wouldn't work. you would then be a robot, having no authorship over your reality.

the things that we practise in our minds produce feelings, and those feelings "authorise" certain realities to manifest. there's nothing really too special to it at all.

---

when you talk about novel folklore, it sounds to me like your objective is to begin encoding new/novel ways to perceive our relationship with our world that have hithertofore been occulted. by giving the reader a new reality option to consider by authorising new phenomena to be accepted into the reality, we open new (novel) interactions that can happen between the symbols in the story.

nobody ever relates 100% to a character, but often there will be something that can relate to -- so, what this means is that let's say I find some similarities to the character (like for example, I did all kinds of drugs and had strange experiences, but I never interacted with an astral woman of a previous lifetime/incarnation). so, I relate to the protagonist of the blind owl in that I know what opium (morphine) and wine's effects are and so I can strongly relate.

this symbolic relation is an interesting one, because you'll notice that when I talk about symbols, I'm talking about words and actions. you can tell a person relates to things symbolically (like a horoscope) when they remove all of the physicality of the thing and look at only the action details (I'm a good communicator, so I'm like mercury).

when you remove the physicality and just look at the action or hechos, then you are creating an *emotional* connection to that symbol (emotion is the antithesis of symbol/action), and it's that emotional connection which brings the egregore/phenomena into reality. to further install the emotional connection, we often times make exceptions ("I'm just like that guy, but that wouldn't drive me to kill my wife") -- so now I can feel a little bit better or worse about my seeming similarity to the character.

hmm, seems that the connection between symbol and emotion didn't catch, so try again... let's say I watch the movie "office space" and I go to work to a dumb IT tech job like peter, so I'm there already with him. I've got a a lumberg-like boss, so symbolically I'm very similar to peter. in the movie, peter goes through a hypnosis session and realises that none of this material crap actually means anything and he has an epiphany.

peter totally rearranges his life and starts to treat his bosses differently as a result. the first thing he does is to get rid of all of the stuff that annoys him (stupid handle that shocks him, his cubicle, etc.) and then starts to become really honest with his bosses. most people lie and are afraid of their bosses, but peter tells them what's on his mind without filters -- and weirdly enough, instead of punishing peter, they respond, "this one is a straight shooter with upper management written all over him". I love that quote because of the "be truthful and shoot straight the arrows" quote.

I and many others related to peter in that movie, and one of the things that movie did was to adjust how I talk to people. I shoot straight the arrows (as you've probably noticed) -- and the weird thing is, that like peter, I've only seen promotions since then. people keep trying to put me in higher and higher management positions because I tell people what I think more often now than what I think they want to hear. this movie dramatically changed my life and because of my emotional connection to it, it authorised/attracted many similar situations that happened to peter, also for myself.

---

to further have a look at emotion and action being polar opposites, notice the concept "I don't feel like doing it". OK, so imagine for a moment that you have to practise your instrument or something like that, but you don't *feel* like doing it. you'll notice that if you force yourself to do it, by performing the action you'll start to feel it and after not too long, it no longer feels like something you don't want to do (especially if it's something you like, rather than a chore).

I personally have a very difficult time doing anything that I don't feel like doing, so I've given this a lot of thought -- because, if I want to do anythting, I have to first find a way to feel like I want to do it. you'll notice that the key word there is "want" because emotion and desire are linked pretty well. you'll notice that when you don't feel like you want to do something, it's because you don't really feel desire/novelty/new/fresh/fun from the thing anymore and so this is a lack of desire. most people try to pump up desire (this is the most common sales technique), but an increase in desire didn't change my perception that I find the thing to be a bit stale, nothing exciting, etc. if I pump up desire, I can get stuff done, but often the next time I have even less desire than I had before.

instead of pumping up desire to cover my lack of interest, what I do, is I change my perception of the thing by making the activity a feeling activity than an action activity. like, if I have to play the instrument, I change my desire from "I want to play this" to "I like the way the instrument feels when I play it" and now when I play it, often times I experience something new from it because I'm focused now on the feel of it instead of the action. novel folklore just prepares you better to have a similar feeling manifest in your reality.

that's good for now. cheers man

### 2022-11-16 13:23 - 008 - promethus defined

(rough draft outline -- still getting more ideas)

listen again
- atlas/atlantis holding up the sky (the firmament)
  - interesting triangle between giza, atlantis and antarctica (the entrance to tartarus)
    - if these sites were energetically connected, this probaably explains pretty well (called isostatic rebound) why africa and asia minor raised up so much, meanwhile atlantis sank (imagine a teeter-totter with one end in atlantis and the other in giza, with the fulcrum attached to the south pole)
- saturn and tartarus (and why the inner earth became "hell")
- the interesting similarities between the myths of vulcan and prometheus, and how it's pretty likely that vulcan was seen as prometheus (giving them weapons/conditions to fight the olympian pantheon)
- the first woman (pandora) and how other myths relate that she (the woman) was created by vulcan.
  - this makes tons of sense if pandora is babalon
  - pandora encodes all of the qualities of the gods into her person, and I believe that all of those things are conceptual/emotional qualities that *lead* to all of things that having opened up her box (vagina) plagued mankind. (remember, we were complete previously, having both male and female genders, probably XXXY and could appear as either male or female, much like the shapehifting dark goddess)
    - look up the qualities and go down the list showing how from a LOA perspective, those qualities produce the plagues that are said to have come from pandora's box.
  - assume I'm right and talk about how XX makes a more powereful presence than XY, and compare how this presence is a self-instigating feedback loop.
    - talk about how one X comes from mom and one from dad, and though there is some variation, females will always retain their mother's X. therefore, from an evolutionary standpoint, one side of the girls never changes, and it's only the father's X that improves -- which gets passed to the daughter, and hopefully she can integrate those improvements into her mother's X.
- finally, talk about the gods as XXXY, and how their presence is going to be even stonger, and also note the similarities between the "triad" relationship between these X's, where one goes up while the other goes down, and the third is the stability/ground/fulcrum.

### 2022-12-26 21:57 - 009 - rituals of aryan warriors

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/atkOawrde20?t=1261)

- they sacrificed 1 out of 100 prisoners of war and put the blood on an inverted sword on a stone platform -> we do the same thing as the devas (sacrifice), but ours is in the context of war (the sword and the stone), so it's like, "we do the same, but expect the opposite cause our victims are not innocent".
- they scalped the prisoners and put their enemies scalps onon their armour -> the hair is like transmitting antennas for people, conceptually speaking, so by wearing their enemies hair, when their enemies would see their armour, they would also see their defeated comrades adornning their armour. huge mental defeat before even engaging in combat.
- they took the skulls of their enemies, dipped them in metal (this is a capacitor) and then drank out of them -> the skull, you can imagine is the most resonant part of the body with the person's thoughts -- so, by drinking an intoxicant and hallucinogen (soma), they were amplifying the thoughts of their enemies so they would be more proficient in defeating them (it's all a mind game, before you even get to the ring/battlefield) -> this also has the added effect of the conquering aryans absorbing the concepts of the culture they're destroying, retransmitting the signals (like the female) from the perspective of the aryan thought structure.

if the borg were a human race, this is how they would fight with only swords and horses. assimilate all things and continue going forward. never look back. etc.

---

also, the scalps make for great performance metric to show who is better combatant, and good for competition amongst the warriors. obviously why they were so prolific and successful.

the cattle slaughter also is another thing that they did which is the same as the devas. you'll notice that these devas/olympians are always associated with bulls and the taurus constellation. they require cattle sacrifice, and so did the aryans (potential connection to cattle mutilations and UFO activity). they're copying the taurens as a mind game, assimilating the taurens' tactics and reusing them on their victims.

it looks to me like there's quite a vibrational prelude to this. remember how I talked about the galaxy being divided in half with one side in opposition to the earth? in kuthumi's ET guide to creation, he talks about this divide in the galaxy of astral beings. one group is to be attracted to the martian base (this is where enki and alalu are), and so I'm assuming that the unwritten aspect there is that many of these martian overlords are actually imported from taurus.

I claim that this episode happened as a response to alalu/prometheus' defeat and is connected to the first self-sabotage. what I mean is that I think the whole kuthumi's guide is a narrative.

imagine two timelines: in both, the INFECTED ONES are birth theirselves into the martians along with enki and alalu. in one timeline, alalu is successful and builds his solar system (which, as a 2nd ray male it would actually make a galaxy). that 2nd ray galaxy is the one the narrative reality we're in now and the whole opposite side of the galaxy of the taurens including enlil are all created beings. alalu self-sacrifices and allows himself to be defeated by YHVH/enlil and his whole setup gets destroyed and enlil uses the moon to control the earth with it.

either way, the martians are not singular in thier efforts. as only the INFECTED ONES, the martians are united, but with enlil in charge and calling the shots, some part is tauren aligned and another part is original INFECTED ONES.

---

you also know the fable of the [black] smith that makes a deal with the devil? the smith part I believe is zarathustra, and the devil is saturn/satan, which was the 4th ray ground in atlantis (he was with thoth, the emitter, too).

### 2022-12-26 22:40 - 009 - north and south pole

when looking at a map of aryan descent, they clearly came from the north pole, hyperborea. their colour is red. the south pole is saturn's domain and his colour is black. when I look at "pre-dynastic"[^1] egyptian status there's a pre-dynastic period of a black colour, but then it turns white and they get the rounded shaped bowling pin hats.. this is the fall of the black dynasty (a time resonance of the end of the tudor dynasty), and became white, as in white and red (cross), like where the aryans of that time fled to, and why gaelic is syntactically similar ty pre-dynastic egyptian.

this black vs red or black vs white I believe was revived with the return of the coneheads (taurens?) in the time of the 18th dynasty (and earlier like with joseph), and the return of YHVH (tauren). queen nefertiti wore a golden hat adorned with the condor, which normally is a black bird. this black bird, cat goddess shows up again.

so, when I think of red zarathustra/santa as the north pole and black saturn/satan as the south pole, again these appear to me to be forces to once again move the martian red ones to a new location. santa is a false black goddess masquerading in black, and zarathustra is a false red as well, wearing the colour of the martians and the symbol of the taurens. this causes further migrations, and may have been what created the east/west schism (we still divide east and west hemispheres of the planet by that position[^2]).

[1]: I put quotes because some black status with insane detail are listed as being kafre, when they clearly are pre-dyanastic

[2]: at the moment, I believe the planet is divided east and west somewhere in the united states, but it's soon returning back to its location of dividing east and west (magnnetic north and south pole) to about where ankor wat is located (dividing russia and china now)

### 2022-12-26 23:00 - 009 - time resonances

I noticed in lbe (cause it's most visible) and other places (including terence's timewave), that there are seeming repitions of history, which repeat events not literally, but symbolically. therefore, I would conclud that probably all three dates (or at least two) are correct, and that these are actually time resonances of the original fall of prometheus. the only differences in these resonances is how the culture environment receives the manifestation of the egregore we're summoning; egregores are the heros we're summoning with or legends and myths (novel folklore), and these summonings are actually what create the "timewave" ebbs and flows.

I believe the 2012 date was actually the end of present ebb and flow calculated and stable appearance of these egregores originally installed by enlil through megalithic architecture, which is why stonework is always in association of summoning the saviour/hero the culture is intending to bring. this summoning is what I believe joseph was doing in the great pyramid during that time. those energies have the capacity to directly affect the prana (earth energies, which we associate with girls and attraction), and chi (solar, emotional/conceptual energies emitted by the sun and presented by moon), thereby creating the conditions for the appearance of something (like YHVH to "save" them from their "slavery").

2012 meant the end of the frequency spectrum which the taurens and their megalithic architecture can control. we now summon these egregores more and more redily with our own thoughts. these narrative elements appear as a response to our thoughts and desire to be right (the original promethian fire).

### 2022-12-26 23:33 - 009 - so, they raided agrarians?

that doesn't make sense. the "plea of the soul of the cow" is strange to me because they're raiding *farmers*, which means if they're killing or multulating cows, they're killing their tools and dramatically increasing the difficulty of farming on a massive scale. this is opposite to the cattle slaughter than YHVH was interesed in, which was of the shepherds. the cattle slughter in this case was their feed, not their tools, and so we need to look at the difference in desire this creates.

when my father was working out in the field, the most fearful thing he had was of losing his tools. if he got his tools stolen, that was how he made his income, so it would be a devistating loss. meanwhile, for a sheperd, losing some cattle is an annoyance, but there are more, so as long as they reproduce this is not a significant problem. however, when looking at it from a desire perspective, the shepherd losing cattle feels like a an assult on survival creating desire for more survival (typical of that time), the assult on one's tools, creates desire for better tools and more protection/security and laws to protect the "plea of the soul of the cow".

I thought that was significant: desire for bottter tools vs survival. both take the symbol of cow slaughter and interpret them differently to produce a tool/security oriented culture vs survival oriented culture of the very early humans. it's also significant because it's a reinterpretation of the time-resonance of prometheus being taken down by cattle slughtering psychos. who's the bad-guy now?

also, keep in mind that saturn/dumuzi was notably very pro-agrarian, not shepherd.

### 2022-12-27 00:07 - 009 - the agrarian and shepherd perspective

the agrarian perspective is notably one of 4th ray, where you're in harmony and balance with the "divine order" (nature) and living off of its bounteousness -- a harkening back to the time of saturn, when the ground was plentiful.

the 2nd ray perspective, in contrary is one of the shepherd, (pathing) where you have a desired destination (a destiny) for the cattle to go, so you mix 1st ray desire with the rules of reality (3rd ray) and you get the pathing toward the destiny. it works the same for a narrative as well, because you have a goal/desire for a character, and so the narrative is the complex interconnectedness of interactions between characters to ultimately bring the character from where they are (1st act) to the goal/desire (5th act). the 2nd ray perspective is the one of thme 3rd act, where the peak/tipping point is passed and no further looking back is possible.

### 2022-12-27 00:18 - 009 - the giant boar as a symbol for aries/mars

this is extremely interesting considereing dr. eugene's thoughts on pigs and hybridisation. the idea is that a lot of human's notable qualities come from pigs, may very well be the origin of "kosher" -- which is because we (humans) have pig qualities mixed with godlike qualities, so when we eat pigs' flesh, we're tuning ourselves to the animal perspective of our DNA instead of our godlike (promethian) perspective of DNA. it may have happened that after consuming pig flesh, some of the kosher people lost their godlike qualities, so in order to maintain a race of purebreads, they are to abstain from foodstuffs that will bring out the animal instinct.

interesting that the symbol for the aryan warrior designed to completely rework all of the symbols (red and white) and stuff of the "gods" is a menacing boar, with horns coming out of its mouth, instead of its head. mars also is a bit of a symbolic shapshifter.

### 2022-12-27 00:26 - mithras slaying the bull

remember how I said that stonework originally was used to determine the destiny of a person, by modifying the locations of the planets (as in the tauren function of the great pyramid), the new form of stonework installed by the aryans is one of narrative, where simply figurative and symbolic statues and situations are placed in the public eye (as the cathedral builders did with "christian" symbols), so as to summon an egregore of that follows the symbols.

I don't know this for sure, but randall carries on at length about the "taurid meteor shower" and mithras -- I have to wonder if the original reason for this symbol, and its incorporation into the mystery cult's saturn worship (father time), and the broken corinthian column (atlantis?) -- as a way to summon a mithraic egregore that that will put an end to the taurid meteor shower and slay the bull (which enlil represents) once and for all. stonework narratives. I'm reminded of the song "stone lady" by eliminator (off the ancient light album)
