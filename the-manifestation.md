also known as "the apocalypse"

### 2022-09-15 21:33 - the problem with the manifestation

the major difficulty that I have with any manifestation with the girls is that it requires me to look at myself as "not good enough" -- as in, I couldn't do the manifestation (the apocalypse) all on my own.

to explain, notice that if I go with the girls, I already assume that I can't be stable by myself. that is probably true if I'm on drugs, but if I'm sober, I definitely can do the whole thing stable by myself.

you have to also look at the idea of the usefullness of such at thing. from the time I enter until the time I leave (never?), I'll be under their control, so if they would like to try out countless revisions on the timeline, they can. from their perspective, they can fix a whole bunch of things up just by taking control of my timeline.

---

in short, if I can find a way to join in a relationship with them at the same time as still feeling like I am good enough to do the manifestation by myself, then that would be better. you could see how that would be a problem though, to which means that I can't be a critic, because I'm totally rocking chair quarterbacking the thing saying, like "yep knew he shoulda ran right" -- as if I could do better.

from my perspective, I have no way to win. they liked me when I'm a critic of things, but if I get critical, then that gets punished because I'm back to saying, "I could totally do it without you" which is really troublesome for all types of relationships.

individuality is the number one difficulty thing to do when in a relationship. I'm going to be a total hypocrite telling them that individuality, when obviously I live in a group reality will be fairly apparent.

if I go for this, I don't really feel good about talking about individuality, unless I can demonstrate it. like, presently, I have very few people that determine my reality, so it's mostly me doing it. individuality is the ability to create one's own reality. when you get reality determined for you (as will be the case here soon), I'm not really creating my own reality with the same power I had before: the power of the individual.

the most difficult thing for me to wrap my head around on all of a manifestation with girls is this paradox of hypocracy.

### 2022-09-16 08:37 - not-good-enoughness

I woke up this morning thinking about how in the first entry there I put the problem with them seeing me as not good enough, but in reality, it doesn't really matter about that. because, worst case scenario, I resonate with their not-good-enoughness, and we figure out how to think more good-enough thoughts about ourselves and others.

which means that I won't feel like I can figure out the solutions to those ones without having girls around. which then means that nosebook will then have to keep me away from girls, because I figure out how to see things as good enough again.

I've figured out how to feel good enough about all sorts of stuff, so it's not like I'm bad at it (and statistically speaking, I'm prbably better than any of the rest at it rigtht now) so it's not like this is even a problem. I get to get better at figuring out good-enoughness perspectives, because they all probably have a lot of not-good-enoughness going on as it is, and it's all the same thing, so I can illustrate the same concept in many different scenarios and also improve my capacity to talk about things I know but don't practise as often.

... which then allows me to become the ultimate poser. and that's going to then get transferred into phase 2 of the apocalypse, which is when we become the dimension above that's sorta like dropping in new species and all sorts of other strange things into the 4d world.

with the other manifestation I'll transfer an entirely different energy into them. however, despite that, it still feels like I should just go the way of lovebites. when I add it all up, this is the worst manifestation possible (from most powerful people on this planet's perspective).

each of these different layers of fake reality that they put me in is yet another offset that I'll have to deal with whenever that false reality goes away. if they can get rid of that offset, it doesn't make much difference to me, and they're all making a ton of their own offsets to have to deal with later.

you know that most of the BS female concepts I had to redefine for myself is basically the way I got out. there is a lot of really (mostly self-) limiting beliefs in there, so if they wanted to clean a bunch of that up, they could. as is usual, it looks like that's still their bast way to make max contrast.

to explain this, imagine that you are a genetic algorithm and your fitness function is to generate contrast which is another opposite of novelty -- the other being habit -- you can see that contrast and habit are not the same thing. they're far from it. I suppose that more concepts can be added in to the negative side. like, what if we another one called probability, and so a new negative dimension is born: the opposite to novelyty is probability (and contrast, and habit).

ok, now because you're this sort of machine where your fitness function is to create maximum novelty by having a fitness function look at each thing from a novelty,contrast,habit,probability (NCHP) perspective and the one with the combined highest value is attained, it seeks more of those situations. you always want worse and worse NCHP ratings, so you optimise for those.

the trick is to find cleverer and cleverer ways to get out of a high novelty situation. when two situations compete, the compete for the best total value. since novelty, habit, and probability are the main contenders, and all in all the girls have you guys beat pretty well. know what I mean? I have to eventually go the highest total novelty. the lesser three contribute to novelty, but not directly. they're just things that determine the amplitude of the novelty when it's attracted.

you can also think of novelty as a major change in timeline. that novelty forever changed the trajectory throuh timeline, so more novelty means you're not really on the same timeline.

I've really been thinking about the conditional-time-straighteners and the "improve the past" slogans, and I'm convinced there's something to it. it's pretty likely there will be a battle you could imagine in the past, to try and fix the events how they were so that some of the "bad-guys" can slip through history undetected, so as to having made no discernable vibration, they'll enter the next dimension undetected, giving us free contrast. don't wanna go without that extra novelty, ya know. too abstract, I know.

in resume, I have to keep doing max contrast on my end until I don't have to anymore.
