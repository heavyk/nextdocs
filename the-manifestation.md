# the manifestation

also known as "the apocalypse"

### 2022-09-15 21:33 - the problem with the manifestation

the major difficulty that I have with any manifestation with the girls is that it requires me to look at myself as "not good enough" -- as in, I couldn't do the manifestation (the apocalypse) all on my own.

to explain, notice that if I go with the girls, I already assume that I can't be stable by myself. that is probably true if I'm on drugs, but if I'm sober, I definitely can do the whole thing stable by myself.

you have to also look at the idea of the usefullness of such at thing. from the time I enter until the time I leave (never?), I'll be under their control, so if they would like to try out countless revisions on the timeline, they can. from their perspective, they can fix a whole bunch of things up just by taking control of my timeline.

---

in short, if I can find a way to join in a relationship with them at the same time as still feeling like I am good enough to do the manifestation by myself, then that would be better. you could see how that would be a problem though, to which means that I can't be a critic, because I'm totally rocking chair quarterbacking the thing saying, like "yep knew he shoulda ran right" -- as if I could do better.

from my perspective, I have no way to win. they liked me when I'm a critic of things, but if I get critical, then that gets punished because I'm back to saying, "I could totally do it without you" which is really troublesome for all types of relationships.

individuality is the number one difficulty thing to do when in a relationship. I'm going to be a total hypocrite telling them that individuality, when obviously I live in a group reality will be fairly apparent.

if I go for this, I don't really feel good about talking about individuality, unless I can demonstrate it. like, presently, I have very few people that determine my reality, so it's mostly me doing it. individuality is the ability to create one's own reality. when you get reality determined for you (as will be the case here soon), I'm not really creating my own reality with the same power I had before: the power of the individual.

the most difficult thing for me to wrap my head around on all of a manifestation with girls is this paradox of hypocracy.

### 2022-09-16 08:37 - not-good-enoughness

I woke up this morning thinking about how in the first entry there I put the problem with them seeing me as not good enough, but in reality, it doesn't really matter about that. because, worst case scenario, I resonate with their not-good-enoughness, and we figure out how to think more good-enough thoughts about ourselves and others.

which means that I won't feel like I can figure out the solutions to those ones without having girls around. which then means that nosebook will then have to keep me away from girls, because I figure out how to see things as good enough again.

I've figured out how to feel good enough about all sorts of stuff, so it's not like I'm bad at it (and statistically speaking, I'm prbably better than any of the rest at it rigtht now) so it's not like this is even a problem. I get to get better at figuring out good-enoughness perspectives, because they all probably have a lot of not-good-enoughness going on as it is, and it's all the same thing, so I can illustrate the same concept in many different scenarios and also improve my capacity to talk about things I know but don't practise as often.

... which then allows me to become the ultimate poser. and that's going to then get transferred into phase 2 of the apocalypse, which is when we become the dimension above that's sorta like dropping in new species and all sorts of other strange things into the 4d world.

with the other manifestation I'll transfer an entirely different energy into them. however, despite that, it still feels like I should just go the way of lovebites. when I add it all up, this is the worst manifestation possible (from most powerful people on this planet's perspective).

each of these different layers of fake reality that they put me in is yet another offset that I'll have to deal with whenever that false reality goes away. if they can get rid of that offset, it doesn't make much difference to me, and they're all making a ton of their own offsets to have to deal with later.

you know that most of the BS female concepts I had to redefine for myself is basically the way I got out. there is a lot of really (mostly self-) limiting beliefs in there, so if they wanted to clean a bunch of that up, they could. as is usual, it looks like that's still their bast way to make max contrast.

to explain this, imagine that you are a genetic algorithm and your fitness function is to generate contrast which is another opposite of novelty -- the other being habit -- you can see that contrast and habit are not the same thing. they're far from it. I suppose that more concepts can be added in to the negative side. like, what if we another one called probability, and so a new negative dimension is born: the opposite to novelyty is probability (and contrast, and habit).

ok, now because you're this sort of machine where your fitness function is to create maximum novelty by having a fitness function look at each thing from a novelty,contrast,habit,probability (NCHP) perspective and the one with the combined highest value is attained, it seeks more of those situations. you always want worse and worse NCHP ratings, so you optimise for those.

the trick is to find cleverer and cleverer ways to get out of a high novelty situation. when two situations compete, the compete for the best total value. since novelty, habit, and probability are the main contenders, and all in all the girls have you guys beat pretty well. know what I mean? I have to eventually go the highest total novelty. the lesser three contribute to novelty, but not directly. they're just things that determine the amplitude of the novelty when it's attracted.

you can also think of novelty as a major change in timeline. that novelty forever changed the trajectory throuh timeline, so more novelty means you're not really on the same timeline.

I've really been thinking about the conditional-time-straighteners and the "improve the past" slogans, and I'm convinced there's something to it. it's pretty likely there will be a battle you could imagine in the past, to try and fix the events how they were so that some of the "bad-guys" can slip through history undetected, so as to having made no discernable vibration, they'll enter the next dimension undetected, giving us free contrast. don't wanna go without that extra novelty, ya know. too abstract, I know.

in resume, I have to keep doing max contrast on my end until I don't have to anymore.

### 2022-09-16 10:29 - not-good-enoughness is like desire

when you consider that when you have sufficient not-good-enoughness, it produces good-enoughness.

to illustrate, I'm the king of not-good-enoughness. from their (the girls) perspective, nothing is ever good enough, but from my perspective, I just want to find my connection.

it's only when I've found enough connection that I feel good-enoughness, and then that is when I'm ready. I can see how from their perspective it looks like I never think it's good enough. it's always good-enough from a high enough perspective.

there's something more to be said about this, but it has escaped me.

### 2022-09-16 10:39 - I think I've pretty much set my goal

so I was thinking about it a bit outside, and there are other options for starting out, but I do believe that I do want to end up in this sort of reality matrix. I think it is the worst possible manifestation for the "popular" vote.

along the way to get there, it'd be really fun to make it even worse. I don't have to do anything. they already have to try and prevent it, so they have to come up with something that will (apparently) try and prevent this WPM, but it's always the case that when making action against sometihng you make the concept that created that thing stronger, so even their best efforts will produce even more WPM.

I figure that after some time they'll really be in a huge pickle, which is good because they don't need to actually do anything for survival because they can't get it wrong. they'll be inextricably linked to our dimension above, so no matter how hard they try to mess it up, they can't.

if they want to get out of the power structure, they won't be able to, so they'll have to figure out how to make their own dimension. a demiurge of maximum capacity.

that way they'll have their own private dimension and also the girls will have their own dimension. when the population becomes a global population, competition will arise in seeming physical dissimilarity (race, colour, gender, etc.), and so this provides for a perfect factioning to begin besides just the binary opposites (my <|not >same or preferred race/colour/gender). they're actually kind of the same dimension, but two different perspectives into it. nosebook from a masculine perspective and nosebook from a feminine perspective (and both of their subsequent perspectives/definitions of all demographics through statistics). in reality neither is even close to reality, but it will shape our reality to their expectations.

### 2022-09-16 10:57 - I wonder the validity of this

I'm listening to a korolova mix and one guy commented that the two things were not well mixed because somehow the slider got left in the middle or something. the guy commented "amateure hour" and so as I was feeling out the thought, I was reminded of st-michaels-work, where his whole job is to keep us all focused on the hymnal.

the picture I had is that these different performers are out there doing things, but their vision has gotten so detailed, that reality is starting to kinda like melt out and it's so hard to stay focused on reality because the only thing they can see is theirself (this is kinda what the start of 5d is sorta like).

so they're having all these problems trying to keep it together, and the ones that know how to not look at theirself too seriously are the ones that are doing well.

it has to do with the way that we care about what others think, but if you think about it, it also manifests as not-good-enoughness. I can look out and see other people doing amazing things, but I can't myself, so I'm probably not good enough to do it.

that's kind of a weird one that disguises itself as not-good-enoughness, but really it's caring too much what others think.

### 2022-09-16 12:53 - a valid concern on narration

this idea goes something like this: right now I'm sorta the narrator of what's happening in the world. if I come out into public, that changes.

same with if I go with the girls. they'll take over a lot of my narration for me (I would hope, anyway).

something to keep in mind. the idea that just came to me is that if we invented a new way to narrate, and by doing that, we're completely leaving the narration to the other narrators.

this will largely set the dividing line between dimensions, and the deciding factor is what narrative they're listening to. imagine the offset on that one: imagine a person that has a very open mind but they're listening to a closed-mind narrator. they get to the side they're going and realise it was all a sham. I think that means I'm going that I'm going to the opposite of that, so I'm going to be the most open minded individual, but in a world built by the narrators. which are my narrators?

some individuals want to be my narrators. I don't see anything wrong with that. it's just more contrast for me. each of these narrated worlds I don't really see, so they have to find ways of integrating me into those other narratives.

so if I go with the girls, they lose connection to my narrative. that's their main concern.

I say let them have some control over my narrative because narrative is really quite funny when the narrators don't have a clue what's actually happening. it's probably pretty comedic, honestly.

---

I'm still trying to figure out how to integrate my future in. I was thinking about how I was going to define it for people and I was thinking about really maybe doing some statistical analysis on it, maybe some risk assessment, and projections. that'd be really awesome.

once we've figured it out statistically, we can just use that as a sorta joke later, kinda like how they were actually our minimum expectations. for me though it's going to be pretty fun because I think probabilities don't really exist (as weird as that sounds).

to explain how I don't think that probabilities don't exist I have to demonstrate by example: we need to build up imaginary scenarios (a set of expectations) and then figure out the statistical probability of meeting another set of expectations in X amount of time. most of the time it'll fail (or, at least I would hope so).

---

my reality was constructed out of symbols and I'll have to pay for that offset later on, but your reality is constructed out of possibilities, and so, you'll probably have to pay for that later on, as well.

these sorts of offsets stack up extra of this opposite to novelty stuff (habit, contrast, probabilities, but there was a fourth one I can't remember now). those things produce instability in the next form of perception and so that becomes the "seed contrast" for the next dimension. so it's probably planned/inteded.

---

I explained the fourth opposite to novelty yesterday, but it got erased I believe (or perhaps other timeline), but the fact remains that I'm still unable to locate it, so it's time to update the concept. whenever a concept goes away from my mind, I have to find a new way to get to the same concept again (so I can explain it), so that means that I get better at getting to a concept. I'll think of it again soon enough, and probably better the next time too. as such, I don't mind having to get to a concept again from more and more unique ways. I'm good at getting around stuff (like physical laws, of science).

it's probably one of the aspects with an extra dimension (resistance -> programmable resistance)

### 2022-09-16 17:27 - different domains of reality

one of the things I could see is that we're going to need narrators to keep up the contrast. then, I could see that we all would supply sort of "reality domains" and these would be run various reality marketing companies.

I don't remember the rest.

### 2022-09-18 03:30 - the trance or drug state

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/tRvko3rCCAU)

these states are one way to achieve an altered state of consciousness, but I know for certain that I do not want to make any manifestation when I'm stoned or under the influence of anything, so if you want me making conscious and clear decisions, I want to go sober. then the idea was that nosebook does *not* want me making conscious decisions, so they do actually want me stoned. I don't want to be stoned because that totally sucks. also, if stoned it's definitely something we'll pay for later, of course.

### 2022-09-18 03:47 - desire is produced from unwanted

the ability to perceive unwanted isn't learned for a bit. you can produce symbolic states for wanted and symbolic states for unwanted as well, and this is basically the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (both in present and future projections/predictions).

so I really only refine my ability to perceive unwanted over time. unwanted is a symbolic construct just like wanted so it's easy for me to see now that there is no good or bad anymore; you just see it for what it is.

in 4d, everything still has a singular angle to it, but in 5d, you see it for what it is (from all apprropriate angles at once), rathar than only as it appears to be from any point in time or space (the illusion). this is pure desire.

though my eyes don't see in 5d, I am still "there" just without visuals. not being able to see it, is actually extremely helpful. I would get lost in the images, I imagine.

I wonder if I had images turned back on, I would turn into a mr-motor (yanono). that's crazy: the only difference between us is perhaps he sees images and I don't. I wonder if my different perspective on the image (cause I can only feel it) probably has transformed some of the rendering of the rendering of his perspectives. interesting.

another interesting thing to observe on this one is that means in the next dimension, I'm the "bad-guy" cause my images are on and I can really imagine some terrible things that I probably am not born with the capability of seeing through to notice that all that matters is how I *feel*; it doesn't have anything to do with the image.

### 2022-09-18 06:34 - if you insist on going through under the influence,

I'd obviously want to spend a time *not* under the influence. I really like being sober. I like being clear-headed. I really don't like the feeling of being stoned for much more time than I have to. I feel like I got the message.

you know there is a good quote from a friend of mine that said, that once you've got the message you can hang up; you don't need to keep talking.

I got the message; I don't need to keep talking.

### 2022-09-18 07:01 - just let it all fall apart

I think it's best to just let it all fall apart. the stuff that needs to be preserved will make it through, so there's nothing to worry about.

the *only* other option to that is to maintain constant contrast and we next logical step/state it all the way to wherever it is we want to go. it's literally the fastest way too because all other manifestions are slightly less contrast.

### 2022-09-18 07:42 - be careful of how fast you attract

I noticed a few reactions wondering why I'm having a change in appearance, and I belive it's cause I have such low resistance, what's happening is the getting there too fast is manifesting me as being a bit pushy or bossy. I literally have no control other than to just feel good about whatever it is, knowing that it's all attraction, anyway.

in general, I think this is a good skill to learn sexually, too because it's like really hard to hold when you're pulling in so hard, but if you relax and then when finally ready pull in, then it's easier for both. the pulling in is the attraction power, and the finally ready is when you know with certaintly that it's just obvious what happens next. one is trying too hard, the other is more like pounceing.

---

I also appear to respond in more and more manner of fact ways. this, I've complained about before is because our language does not have a "this is how I see it (though it may be wrong)"... so:

- "this is how I see it (though it may be wrong)"
- this is the <most|least|amount> likely thing to happen
- this is the way I think "they" see it
- this is <amount> likely to happen

I will try and be less manner of fact, but from this perspective I see things as abosolutes. they either don't interact with the rules or they do and are delt with. this way is weird, I know I need to hang up the phone. anyway, it's cool because in my perspective, I can only find a way to feel good at whatever is happening, going too fast or too slow. it all has to be perceived as just the next logical thing, anyway.

I may also be messing with their minds a bit to throw out a few bad ideas to get those ones shot down quickly (easy wins feel like progress). who knows. at this point, I have so many "steering mechanisms" for me in place, I basically just feel good about whatever is happening. sometimes it comes out as a joke and other times as an apparant joke for me. sometimes I don't see it at all. I'm nearly blind, ya know.

[song: you keep holding back; don't hold back]

so the thing is I not holding back. I have a constant speed system, and so if attraction gets too fast, it comes out as assertiveness, but if I'm attracted too slowly, I suppose a number of things could happen -- all within my realm of belief. all of the things that I think are believable, can happen. when I'm holding back, that's because there's too much attraction. too little attraction and things get passive (like a worker at an unfun job).

I don't have to worry from my perspective because we get there when we get there. it's an autobalancing system, so I/we can't get there any faster or slower.

it's the slowest (because it does all the WPMs), but also the fastest (because it has so much experience/karma).

### 2022-09-18 15:16 - the manifestation reverse feedback loop

today (or maybe it was yesterday) I noticed another thing about having a more universal perspective, and that is that everything must be constant. the increment is the same (it's basically the clock signal), but the magnitude for each interval can be quite varying. each increment also contains a symbolic language to it which each set of symbols is connected to a "knowing" or "understanding" of how the symbols work together. so that allows you to encode logic into the symbolic access of concepts.

what that means from my perspective is I have to get to constant contrast across each interval. this is the only way that I can bypass the logic. from their perspective, they're looking to "figure me out" and like the astrologers of old, they were interested in figuring out the best predictors (alignments and stuf) are for certain goals and/or worries. so, they encode this symbolic access into all of their symbols -- and probably lock everyone not in the group access to the concepts -- which actually means that we all get to find a new way to this form of perception. I guarantee the weed access point will be properly filtered and regulated, cause that's what they do. they don't want it easy for anyone else to figure out what I know. while on the topic, that's probably the main reason they don't want sex, because it would instantly give a lot of others access to new concepts they previously didn't have access to (I wrote about this in a past entry, but I can't remember where now)

in short, when things are going too slow, good things (wanted) start to happen in order to speed it up. however, if we're going too fast, bad things (unwanted) start to happen.

one idea is to try pushing me too fast for a bit so that I get out a lot of bad stuff, but then later when approaching the manifestation, slow me way back down again to constant contrast.

### 2022-09-19 15:59 - what are the implications?

I'd like to ponder for a moment what some of the implications of me realising that I am the universe.

first, most notably, that means that I am on my return back to source, which means, try as hard as you want to try and stop it, I will continue to rise in frequency until I fully am able to realise myself as that. I'm basically completely unstoppable.

many others who also see thierselves that way will continue on with me. we are the universe (in process of manifestation).

if I now think of myself as the sperm that's going into the next universe egg, then what *is* the universe? I figure it's one of those feminine reality matrixes, so I have to imagine that they'll keep working on a bigger and bigger reality the larger our consciousness can conceive of ourselves.

one such stop along the way to realising that I am the universe, is realising that "I" am a galaxy. I am a person. I am a planet. etc. I think the dividing line between these concepts there are other conceptual/feminine reality matrixes. you have spatial types of matrixes and you have organisational ways to look at the same universe (maths, sciences, etc). each of these systems organises thought inside of it to maintain its own structure (every organisation is self-serving).

this barrier can be looked at conceptuaally is selfishness. where does self end and begin when I'm looking at someone and I see their manifestation as something that I'm really glad they're having, right? the opposite to this is, "that's not my problem" -- see how both are an entrance into and also an exit out of the reality matrix.

if I'm concerned with the manifestation of others around me (good or bad), I'm in the side of needing to be glad for the other person like a parent would be glad for their child to have a good manifestation; my self is now perceived as so far outside of myself, I see all of you all as aspects of myself. I'm glad for everything everybody gets cause it's a perfect refection of that aspect of myself (that's why I used the example formerly of parenting/husbandry).

these aspects (you all) are all just finding their own way at their own pace. I know they'll all make it just fine (cause they're still with me in some way connected to me), so I'm like yeah, they'll all figure it all out at their own pace: "not my problem".

let's get back to the aspects of myself part because this is confusing to some. anyone can do it. so, if I figure out that I am the universe, well, then wouldn't all of everything around me reflect me and how I am, so therefore, wouldn't it then be fairly obvious that the stars, planets, moons, etc. all be transforming as a reflection of me? seems obvious. what's stopping you from thinking the same about me or anyone else? it's a reference frame for the mental imagery. that's probably why my vision keeps expanding -- because of that "frame of reference" (aura) keeps getting bigger.

anyone who thinks they're the universe has to have enough hubris to believe that he influences his reality. he would also be so preposrous as to believe that evevery single thing out there is a reflection of him -- everything out to the galaxies and superclusters or whatever. that's pretty crazy, right? who in the world would *ever* come to realise such hubris?

I guess I'm out of the closet now. lol. somebody's got to do it. everyone will stay (depart the train) at the size they feel comfortable in. in my perspective, they are my perspective (concept of who they are) *minus* the limitng beliefs that they hold about theirself; more contrast the better. somone has to design these barriers, and that seems to be the "femininine" form of thought. design your own reality how you want it to be. I won't really carry on this subject in conversation. if someone wants to bring it up, it's fine, but it really is a *self-knowing* that everything in reality reflects you. you are also completely unstoppable (you're litterally on an unstoppable journey back to the source of who you think you are). if I set my mind to it, I can get it. my desire alone is sufficient.

---

everyone will design their own realities. the most rigid, of course will be your more totalitarian and authoritarian realities. their reality model sees threats and has te neutralise those threats. no problem. they're all designing their own reality to their own specifictions. some will stay at this reality right now. some will continue on to the next one we make as well.

from my perspective, I keep attracting new ways to codify my reality into a new universe that I will then be seeded into. they're all just reflections of my perspective, which is why they're designing the one above that, and so fourth -- until we run out of ideas and we have to finally live in the reality we made for ourselves. you have to "dog food" your own code.

the "reality technicians" are coding this reality just like a woman "codes the reality" of the reality matrix the child is born into, does that, so do eventually we have to live inside of own creations. they're there to punish me to eventually have to live out my own reality the way I perceived it to be. so, then I'm coding eventually for a whole new universe reality matrix. starting small and working our way up. eventually, we'll run out of reality definitions for it and reality disappears. we've gone to 5d. to ensure we can still interact with this reality and still remain in *physical* proximity to the conepts that you love, all those need to be rendered into sense (see, smell, taste, touch, and potentially new ones too soon), so you see that because we want so much to be able to *see* the manifestation, we *need* to see it.

we're the guy on the matrix that gives up the location of the nebu-chad-nezzar to special agent smith for a steak. we want the matrix.

unlike cypher, I know that, like the universe, reality is a reflection of me.

---

OMG, totally derailed. this totally happens to me all the time. I was talking about implications and then did a "rabbithole".

brb.

### 2022-09-19 17:08 - my way is the right way

is the correct perspective to have.

then, just let experience smoothe off some of the rough edges until your perspective is a sphere.

---

other classics are, "my concepts the only things that exist in the universe" or "my definition is the right one", or "what I believe is right, is right"

these are all classic symptoms of someone who thinks they're the universe.

### 2022-09-19 17:35 - more implications

it means the feminine reality matrix that exists presently only goes up to 5d (6d if rudolf is right), will begin to disappear more  and more in my perception. it's pretty easy to see when there are such wide gaps between ideas. so, reality should begin to start to transform into something that does not have a fachada anymore. a sort of knowing or emotional sense of reality. like me, the 3d fachada is still visible and stuff, but I've "gone airbore" you know how like when water evapourates, it has enough energy to remain fixed to the material reality of whatever the water was stuck to. if that's happened, it justt means your upward velocity is now more than the downward velocity.

the downward velocity can now only be experienced in interactions with other people. other than that, you're going to live forever, or until you decide "here is good enough for me" and you're reality will reflect your perception of it (we all code our own reality), so we're all living the reality we create, and some people will decide it's "good enough" for them. we, however, are plagued with eternal not-good-enoughness, so we can *always* see an improvement in there somewhere. max novelty.

### 2022-09-19 17:48 - do you ever wonder...

... if alien civilisations just take human genome and put it on a planet and then spectate them and see (analyse) the process it takes for a human to make it's trip "back to the source", and they're laughing at us and commenting on us at how noob all the fails along the way were. like we're the failure that they all like making fun of?

### 2022-09-19 17:57 - do you ever wonder...

... what the manifestation would have been if I hadn't smoked the joint? does someone ever want to go back to experience the difference to see what life would have been like if I delayed it even longer? maxine-foot-dragon?

### 2022-09-19 18:04 - that may have been the first thing I regretted

smoking that joint is probably one of the first things I've ever to have really regretted. I thought I regretted raquel for a whole, but not really. I didn't, and don't feel regret about anything ever, so why do I feel regret about this?

you know, I do suppose I would go back to having never smoked the joint, honestly. I'm going to pretend as if it had never happened. sometimes it's best not to tell others what you see, right? we'll see how that goes. like jerry with keeping abraham a secret because it's weird, I don't think it'll stay a secret too long. as long as you want.

### 2022-09-19 18:09 - maybe I regret writing about it

the world will never be the same.

### 2022-09-19 18:11 - fake it till you make it?

I know a buncha posers gonna be out there pretending to see it too, so maybe just fake it till you make it? you'll get there.

### 2022-09-19 18:14 - everyone is just a reflection of me

all the posers are a reflection of me.

### 2022-09-19 19:27 - do over

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x7Mph8oOIg)

cause I kinda do, you know. I really do wonder a lot what life would have been like if I hadn't have smoked.

it's no secret that psychedellics are the biggest ego builders, and if you don't grow with the size of the ego, the joints loose their effectiveness.

if I could go back to not having smoked, I would -- but, if you think about it, I'm just the stage magician, keeping you all busy with stuff to see as they install the new matrix.

they're playing me like a puppet of their expectations. being at nearly zero resistance, I can't *not do* the things the most influential LOA voters expect me to do. I do what they expect me to do. I experienced an idea on 2022-09-10 and I went with it. from basically that point on, I'm completely floating now; I'm 100% at the mercy of their expectations.

so, by going back, I get to regain my control. it's a control thing. then, I had full control, but like this, they control me completely with their expectations.

this is going to make a splash.

### 2022-09-19 19:38 - how long of a flight are we on?

like seriously, what do you guys expect to happen?

### 2022-09-19 19:40 - I really like the time 19:38

it's one of those things where I just like it because it's double on one side, but it's also the same day number

### 2022-09-19 20:08 - do you wonder if celebration is bad?

I walked in from outside and jaron is watching austin powers and he drives into some place with a bunch of "swinger" women around, and he has his "woah" face on.

this reminded me of jesus going into -- palm sunday, I believe -- they all celebrate him and his awesomeness, right before he got crucified. the celebration, no matter how many swinger chicks allowed is just another bump.

it's not really bad, not really actually any more than a "fake it till I make it" attitude, because they both come from feeling better physically than what I'm ready for. or, feeling different than how I expect to. or, feeling a way about something physical that I'm expected to feel (cause I'm a society actor).

my job is just to keep discovering/noticing what I like.

### 2022-09-19 20:14 - I don't prefer celebration

I prefer to just go back to reality-kenny as if nothing happened, which is *obviously* what I'm going to do. haven't you seen how easy it is just to feel the way I want. I prefer to just focus on something mundane while my mind is elsewhere.

connect? let's see, reality-kenny is focusing on something mundane. I just let him sorta operate all of the basic stuff anyway. reality-kenny doesn't really perceive those thoughts because they're too high vibration, and don't have easy english concept way to put them into reality, this the strong influencers of this reality matrix aren't ready to let such a concept become physical, so we keep to the material reality.

though this perspective exists, I prefer to enjoy the perspective of action-kenny. down there, I don't have to worry about anything other than now, because I already know where I'm going anyway (nobody can stop me). from action-kenny's perspective I can do whatever I feel like doing, so I pay most attention to how I feel, and when I'm feeling pretty poorly, I find a way to limit myself from making action.

reality-kenny is the feeling version of action-kenny.
action-kenny turns on when I don't feel too good;
reality-kenny is on the rest of the time.
reality-kenny just feels the way he wants about the experience.
reality-kenny leaves *all* action to instead be reaction.
(because I'm attracting everything toward me)
(every *reaction* is a reflection of how I feel)

### 2022-09-19 20:33 - the secret

we can just keep all of this a secret.
that way others can believe it too and be secret about it.
if anyone who wants to join in, they can
nobody actually knows who the members are,
so anyone be a member, as it's probably a secret.
so if we all keep the "I'm the universe" thing a secret.
that way anyone can be a member.

I felt like I repeated myself.
it is a circular concept and very fast moving,
hard to describe in long sentences.
[the manifestation](/the-manifestation.md) *is* the secret

### 2022-09-19 21:11 - cause like you know...

... it would be weird if I were telling people what to do and stuff, so I figure if I just never talk about it, it's sorta like how I was when I was little and I didn't offer information. I kept things that I believed about myself a secret. it wasn't able to be kept a secret. it just creates such a problem when I interface with someone else because they can't fathom how much I actually like being me. nobody understands that, ya know.

I don't want to ever tell people what to think, so I feel so weird revealing my own thought patterns, but I figure that since you already have my thought patterns anyway, why not just say them in words. I figure it's probably the first time anyone has ever done this since edward de vere (I am that I am). you can imagine how strange it is to reveal my own thought patterns to the observers.

I'm just saying that I'd always sorta kept my really high opinion of myself a secret. everybody is all about taking psychedellics to "lose" their ego, but I think of it as *gaining* my ego, rathar than losing it. I wondered if one could gain one's virginity, rathar than losing it. weird idea.

it's pretty easy to keep that a secret because reality-kenny is so good at just staying right range in a range of environments, that nobody really observes the "self-centred" thoughts that I have all of the time. I don't really think I'm the only person that thinks they're the centre of the universe though. I'm fairly certain that almost everbody does, unless culture and expectations has restricted it -- therefore, I think that pretty much thinks they are the centre of the universe. which is just about right, if it were true.

I suppose we should all just sorta keep it a secret. exclusive invite-only club.

you have to be invited by someone to join the club of those that believe that they create their own reality.

### 2022-09-19 21:35 - what's obviously happening

imagine a cosmic ray that's traveling at such a tremendous speed (way way way faster than light) and my body has been made to be the attractor of it. I'm not the only one that will get the consciousness. out before it, imagine these pressure waves -- sort of like sonic booms that are traveling out ahead of it in the medium, but because it's so fast, all of the mediums below that particle bunch up so you have this cascade of events that are created symbolically as a sort of preparation for its arrival into the medium (the singularity). the physical effects, will be some of the last to arrive.

it's not really a cosmic particle. I just like to imagine it as the fastest particle in the universe because it has the most contrast in all of its experience (source, the ancestors, all that is, etc).

before the physical effects will arrive, there will be random desire to just try some new things out (I think of this as the 60s but there are smaller waves surrounding it).

OK, so I just realised that I should be explaining that over the years I've given a lot of thought to novelty theory and what is it's "real" (physical) interaction with this reality. this is an attempt to explain it.

novelty theory has this fractal structure to it where you see the same signature repeated over and over in self-similar waves (think zooming into a mandelbrot). I really think that what we're actually looking at is a sort of wave front or something like a "sonic boom" of a collision between medium speeds.

so now, let's just assume that terence's timewave was an accurate representation of the wavefront, then the frequency can be calculated if you were to know the speed of the last outside medium in the prior (solar?) regime (not 100% about this). oh, maybe it's something like the spectrum of the sun, and so that is increasing now to a point where it wasn't in the previous solar regime. we'll float around in the frequency of our attraction. the higher the frequency of the attraction, the higher the frequency of the sun's spectrum it's outputting (gamma and higher by now I suspect). the new "timewave" can then be calculated as another this self-similar vibrational signature. I don't know the dimensional complexity (whatever you want I guess), and then that is *your* timewave. adjust it until your daily events fit the novelty graph. oops, derailed.

where was I... oh yes, OK, out in front of this particle there will be mediums of faster and faster speeds. this would normally just turn LOA on hyperdrive. I'm the opposite of that, which is that I disintegrate reality by making everything next logical step/state. for me, what's real is no longer the physical stuff, so reality starts to disintegrate rapidly.

there are a lot of people invested in the reality matrix that we're in now, so to avoid reality disappearing entirely, a new "physical" reality matrix will exist. it'll have way better graphics; something, I'm apparently pretty good at doing, probably because I never "see" it. we're all the ones that didn't have any faith.

for me, I know that I gatta see it before I believe it type of person. I know there are a lot of others with this "problem" as well. I like not seeing so much that I want to keep it going. I don't really *need* to see it. the longer I can continue to not see, the better it is for me, because then I don't ever visualise my reality, but instead I just create it in the moment. for me, more than images, I like the 3d reality because I don't really have to look at it which gives me the freedom to feel so much.

if I get distracted from who I am and start to give too much importance to this reflection of myself, reality -- then, I lose track of who I am and have to live out that reality that I created. inotherwords, they have to build a new matrix because they too have a heap of baggage that they've got to get through "undetected". they're no different than nosebook. that desire to find a way to sneak through to the next dimension/galaxy/universe in a padded environment is the seed contrast for the next whatever. inotherwords, nosebook, the female mind and culture all have the same christ perspective of not-good-enoughness and wanting to preserve and help those less-than (to their detriment). it's only when you forsake those ridiculous ideas and see yourself as good enough (mediocrates) are you reborn into the reality matrix you perceived for myself. I put myself in this jail, because it was fun. oh, I make my own reality. duh.

### 2022-09-23 22:45 - seems there are some ...

I have been paying attention to what [I just wrote in novelty-theory](/concepts/novelty-theory.md#2022-09-23-1942---forethought-and-afterthought-are-both-feelings) because in it I was talking about how the ability to produce events for oneself is a very interesting thought. as one of the examples, I used marc because of his ability to talk whilist doing a million things at once, meanwhile he's even able to adapt his strategy. he's completely on autopilot and because of so much practise, he's just interacting with the macro things. each macro thing is easy because he can see the events that produce kind of like action triggers. it appears to be entirely emotion based (just like emotional triggers). unfortunately, it appears that this (at least for him) is a right-hemisphere thing, and mine is kinda like shut down, so multitasking is very difficult for me.

anyway, I'm not useless, and my left-side's capability to get better at stuff is increasing. I'm not sure if my right-hemisphere is activating again or if I'm building up the same capability in the left-hemisphere. I think it's perhaps the latter.

at any rate, one of the ideas I have is to actully work on getting that capacity back in my right-hemisphere. I know that nosebook has occupied my that hemisphere, and it doesn't really bother me. however, what I do like about the manifestation path that I'm on now (reality-kenny and just feeling my way through the process) is that it gives me more time.

one of the main issues that I have and a lot of my source of not-good-enoughness is remaining in a disconnected state. I know that in a connected state my right-hemisphere is going to be working so I can do that thing that marc does where I just control my body from a macro perspective. the other times that I've experienced it, it came along with a pretty dramatic change in position that I view myself.

you'll also notice that when I'm stoned, I perceive things much more from the 3rd person perspective, saying "you" and "he" a lot more, because I'm kinda outside of myself looking inward at myself watching me perform the actions. so, obviously that's something that's natural to me.

---

I said all of that because I noticed that there is a lot of difficulty around me and talking about science or carbon or any types of technology. I think they're trying to force a manifestation, and it's likely to happen anyway that the girls will activate my right-hemisphere, so I'm not really worried about it.

at the same time there are others that are really worried about me getting out into the public where it's much harder to control the media, so they're also quite interested in me not doing anything with any marketing or anything like that. ideas are dangerous and they could really unsettle their setup.

on top of all of that, they definitely don't want any technology coming out. [yesterday I proposed the idea of looking at the manifestation from a purely business/money/self-worth perspective](), and I think that wasn't too well received either. they definitely don't want any of that technology to actually get into the hands of the consumer.

this got me thinking about the future in which many advances in technology mean that we're not just earth and a star and some planets, but earth has figured out how to use the sun's power to power all sorts of things. creating stars is now something we can do, and they're using that technology of moving atoms around to create even up to planets. I know that I would enjoy figuring out a lot more things in genetics, because if DNA *is* a reflection of perception, I want to invent a whole bunch of species that see things very strangely and figure out an environment that is suitable for them to become conscious beings as well. providing the biology for these planets seems really cool of an idea for me.

---

everyone keeps trying to think of everything as happening now, and people think that this is *forethought* but it is not. it's just an image. I've really started to dig in mentally to this peruvian[^1] form of vision, because it's not at all european. it's funny how [in that definition](), I basically said that forethought is the feeling that brought the thought, and afterthouht is the way that I feel about the thought -- so that means that forethought is just letting everything happen the way it's going to happen and feeling good about whatever it is. I know that desire is a lot more powerful than trying to think it all through and anticipate the best. just enjoy the process

about "peruvian imagination" (or lack thereof) -- I first noticed it when I was at alfredo's bar, but I didn't put words to it till tejidos diana. having known mauricio (he's colombian but had imagination), I associate that lack of imagination with the peruvians (specifically the more indigenous ones). I think it's quite possible that imagination in relation to desire may be an "aryan" trait, most significantly that we have something that we want and so then using images, we try and figure out the way to get that desire.

though that capability is what most would think of as "forethought", I don't see it at all this way. forthought for me is the constant emotional feedback I get *before* I think a thought and I know ahead of time if I'll like it or not. my new way of forethought is probably the expansion that our race is going through, and it's because concept and feeling comes before thought, and I believe what I've been developing is *very* superior to aryan forethought.

hey that's kinda cool. I know a lot of people associate water with emotions (I associate air), so it's kind of a cool coincidence that aryan forethought is imaginative, and aquarian forethought is in-the-moment feeling feedback. get it? air-ian is imagination and aqua-rian thought is emotions (it's backwards). I would have said that air-ian thought is emotion based and aquarian is picture based because I associate the imagination with water.

to really outdo myself, I think it's a really cool idea to develop that multi-tasking event producing capability in my left-hemisphere as well, so that I can perform like somone connected while still remaining disconected. they can't shut down my left-hemisphere as well (else I'd be in a coma), so if I just figure it out, I can do it all. this is kinda something I want to do, and the nice thing is it works really good for everyone too.

### 2022-09-24 08:06 - I woke up thinking about the previous entry

it's quite possible that these are definitely nosebook ideas, but I'd like to share them anyway. I woke up thinking about the "worst" manifestation, which would be -- I mentioned that I don't really make decisions anymore and instead just feel good about whatever -- which is what I'm kinda doing in this entry, too. well, the implication here is that nosebook is probably going to try and stick me in their "least bad" situation, which is sorta not that bad really, which is probably no older girls (so no children) and also they're going to want to try and steer the girls to keep me away from "important" things like technology and creativity.

this sounds prety miserable to me just on the surface. I already dislike girls in general because it's impossible to get anything creative done with them around, so that will only compound that problem if I continue to see it that way (which is quite likely because that's what I'm attracting and that's probably what nosebook wants -- is some sort of proxy control to keep me away from technology).

the other reason why it sounds miserable to me is I don't know how to have high-level thought. to a large extent, my capablity to think and reason is often times a reflection of the person I'm interacting with. you'll notice that after watching a jason jorjani video, I'm quite a bit more capable of rendering philosophical thought into coherent form. I really like that, and I really like learning new things from myself in that way. if I'm confined to their thought capability, it feels like I'm constantly struggling to express myself. in general, I've found it nearly impossible to actually have any intelligent conversation with girls ever. I much prefer to listen to them and study them than to converse because -- I dunno, it's like they don't have an ability to see things on the horizon or something. I haven't quite figured out what it is exactly, but one thing I've never really experienced -- cept for once which was xyla explaining lindsey's method for clearing a space out, and I'm not sure she explained the mental process that occurs when you have to replace everything in the room, though I seemed to have picked up on her unspoken words -- is that girls have never been able to explain what is actually going on in their heads. the mental process is alway elusive, so it's caused me to try and figure them out to figure out their mental processes.

the most frustrating thing for me about this is that I don't actually get to figure it out. I mentioned in a few previous entries that I find that nosebook is very very similar to feminine thought in the nature of its character, and so it's no surprise that the technology that is capable of looking inside of their heads is also restricted from me. it seems that I'll never be able to figure it out either by asking them or by using technology.

the other thing I mentioned is that I really like the idea of starting to use my left-hand more and try to see if I can't duplicate all of the right-hemisphere capabilities in my left -- however, in addition to all of that, I really want to just go at it myself. I want to figure it all out myself and do all of it. girls are fine, but they're kind of a bait. they're not what I really want. I think I really want to just keep going on all of my stuff, and do it *my* way, which is by attraction and a very dynamic personality (I change pretty rapidly in comparison to others). I *know* that attraction is much much more powerful than secrets and trying to withhold information, so I figure I'll just do that. you guys can all figure out your own attraction. as I keep evading nosebook's advances, I notice they keep getting stronger, so eventually nobody will even notice that their lives are completely controlled. not my problem.

tl;dr - I think the way that the right-hemisphere has some pretty incredible capabilities to it, including time travel and other such things, but it's very undesibable for the establishment for anyone to be able to actually use that part of their brain for technical stuff (singularity technologies). this is probably been why women have been kept logically in the dark for so long. it seems likely for me especially they want the right-hemisphere (probably the location of my brain's feminine thought) to continue to remain ellusive for me. I want to have it though and even improve upon it. so, I plan on duplicating the right-hemisphere's brain in my left with all of the improvements I've come up with, but I'm going to go the masculine route to get there (I'm doing it my way. nobody can help me. I'm the centre of my own universe).

### 2022-09-24 19:52 - come just as I am

I noticed a meta theme happening. in one of the songs on "daughters of the dawn", they say "come just as you are", which is sort of like come even though you're not ready -- I took it sort of like, don't worry we'll sortof absorb the impact (this is least manifestation). which is in contrast to all of the other manifestations where there is all of this idea for a purpose or goal.

so, the meta theme is not really one of readyness, but instead of ... man I can't think it so well with them playing. let me try to penetrate the thought spectrum. right, instead of readyness, the subject is about how large of a manifestation that it is.

---

to talk about this, I'd like to introduce the concept of conditional-time-straighteners. imagine for a moment that they want to find a way to pass certain entities through the changeover in dimensions, but give them an artificial reality, for which this is the new dimensional pet. just like we have animals that get domesticated, this is the same thing when upgrading to a higher dimension perspective (like now). they program the reality and they like some pets to come along

now, imagine for a moment that they can move around in time, so what they're looking for is the most manipulatable timeline, because then it's easier to make constant. as in just imagine trying to make our present times have no real big bouts of contrast; instead, a constant amount of contrast/anti-novelty. their goal is to reorder history so that I make it through without a certain high novelty/anti-novelty creators, I need go the whole way steady without any big amounts of contrast. what that means in practise is, they're interested in always trying to make as little bit of a manifestation as possible.

this is what I'm all about anyway going for the least manifestation all the time.

I tend to agree with that perspective, but I would like to explain that it's not "least" manifestation, it's the "most constrast", because the most contrast is the smallest possible increment of contrasts. the most perfect contrast is a line that's so straight that it's got next to nothing in variation (always around 0), but it oscilllates above and below 0 many many many (uncountable) times faster than visible light. I don't think I'm going to get that kind of precision this time around, but perhaps the next time. I need lots and lots of offsets (uncountably many). for me, it's not the size of the manifestation that happens, it's that there are more than thousands per second (and accelerating). so for me a manifestation only lasts a very tiny fraction of a second, so by extension, they're all so tiny because they last such a short period of time. you know I'm using really conservative numbers. it's quite possible those numbers are larger. just saying.

another way to look at my perspective is, it needs to be next logical step/state, because anything else would be tremendously destabilising for me. smoking has been seen by me as a huge risk for me because historically I had difficulty switching states, so I couldn't just switch in and out. you know, I think that's a skill that ayahuasca and/or mushroom gave me, btw. I simply cannot try and do anything that doesn't feel like next logical step/state in sober state.

### 2022-09-24 20:35 - being responsible for my reality

there is another meta theme happening here and that is, how responsible do I want to be for my reality?

there are various ranges of manifestations that offer more or less than full responsibility, so it's kind of a question of how much I want to be attracting everything that's happening. I don't really try and make any reality happen; nosebook does all of that for me. I just let them sorta pull the levers pretending they're in control because it doesn't really matter to me the order of anything, just that it's a reflection of my desire.

so, for example, I want to sit down and write this, so I do. then, within the the parameters set by the music I'm listening to, my mental state of mind, etc. -- then, they go around swapping things in and out and trying to manipulate it, but in reality they're just micromanaging the actions, as it's just me making the desire to want to do something. they're constrained by the parameters of the situation, but my desire always pulls me in the right direction. it's become so natural to follow those impulses now, that I probably appear to have really good timing, cause my life is beginning more and more to reflect the way that I feel, and so I get to kinda play around like a child does.

you know that for a child, the entire word refelcts how they feel, and so, everything that appears in your reality is just magical, so trying out different emotions just the fun of it. you know, I did this a few times today where I repeated a character but put my sincerity into it, just to see how weird it felt for me to do an "attention whore" techniques or whatever. I just play around with characters just like a child does.

anyway... so, I was talking about getting good at following my impulses, so I just don't understand what is the problem to understand that I just always to "minimise your impact", because making a big splash isn't necessary. I already do it naturally.
