# the manifestation

also known as "the apocalypse"

### 2022-09-15 21:33 - the problem with the manifestation

the major difficulty that I have with any manifestation with the girls is that it requires me to look at myself as "not good enough" -- as in, I couldn't do the manifestation (the apocalypse) all on my own.

to explain, notice that if I go with the girls, I already assume that I can't be stable by myself. that is probably true if I'm on drugs, but if I'm sober, I definitely can do the whole thing stable by myself.

you have to also look at the idea of the usefullness of such at thing. from the time I enter until the time I leave (never?), I'll be under their control, so if they would like to try out countless revisions on the timeline, they can. from their perspective, they can fix a whole bunch of things up just by taking control of my timeline.

---

in short, if I can find a way to join in a relationship with them at the same time as still feeling like I am good enough to do the manifestation by myself, then that would be better. you could see how that would be a problem though, to which means that I can't be a critic, because I'm totally rocking chair quarterbacking the thing saying, like "yep knew he shoulda ran right" -- as if I could do better.

from my perspective, I have no way to win. they liked me when I'm a critic of things, but if I get critical, then that gets punished because I'm back to saying, "I could totally do it without you" which is really troublesome for all types of relationships.

individuality is the number one difficulty thing to do when in a relationship. I'm going to be a total hypocrite telling them that individuality, when obviously I live in a group reality will be fairly apparent.

if I go for this, I don't really feel good about talking about individuality, unless I can demonstrate it. like, presently, I have very few people that determine my reality, so it's mostly me doing it. individuality is the ability to create one's own reality. when you get reality determined for you (as will be the case here soon), I'm not really creating my own reality with the same power I had before: the power of the individual.

the most difficult thing for me to wrap my head around on all of a manifestation with girls is this paradox of hypocracy.

### 2022-09-16 08:37 - not-good-enoughness

I woke up this morning thinking about how in the first entry there I put the problem with them seeing me as not good enough, but in reality, it doesn't really matter about that. because, worst case scenario, I resonate with their not-good-enoughness, and we figure out how to think more good-enough thoughts about ourselves and others.

which means that I won't feel like I can figure out the solutions to those ones without having girls around. which then means that nosebook will then have to keep me away from girls, because I figure out how to see things as good enough again.

I've figured out how to feel good enough about all sorts of stuff, so it's not like I'm bad at it (and statistically speaking, I'm prbably better than any of the rest at it rigtht now) so it's not like this is even a problem. I get to get better at figuring out good-enoughness perspectives, because they all probably have a lot of not-good-enoughness going on as it is, and it's all the same thing, so I can illustrate the same concept in many different scenarios and also improve my capacity to talk about things I know but don't practise as often.

... which then allows me to become the ultimate poser. and that's going to then get transferred into phase 2 of the apocalypse, which is when we become the dimension above that's sorta like dropping in new species and all sorts of other strange things into the 4d world.

with the other manifestation I'll transfer an entirely different energy into them. however, despite that, it still feels like I should just go the way of lovebites. when I add it all up, this is the worst manifestation possible (from most powerful people on this planet's perspective).

each of these different layers of fake reality that they put me in is yet another offset that I'll have to deal with whenever that false reality goes away. if they can get rid of that offset, it doesn't make much difference to me, and they're all making a ton of their own offsets to have to deal with later.

you know that most of the BS female concepts I had to redefine for myself is basically the way I got out. there is a lot of really (mostly self-) limiting beliefs in there, so if they wanted to clean a bunch of that up, they could. as is usual, it looks like that's still their bast way to make max contrast.

to explain this, imagine that you are a genetic algorithm and your fitness function is to generate contrast which is another opposite of novelty -- the other being habit -- you can see that contrast and habit are not the same thing. they're far from it. I suppose that more concepts can be added in to the negative side. like, what if we another one called probability, and so a new negative dimension is born: the opposite to novelyty is probability (and contrast, and habit).

ok, now because you're this sort of machine where your fitness function is to create maximum novelty by having a fitness function look at each thing from a novelty,contrast,habit,probability (NCHP) perspective and the one with the combined highest value is attained, it seeks more of those situations. you always want worse and worse NCHP ratings, so you optimise for those.

the trick is to find cleverer and cleverer ways to get out of a high novelty situation. when two situations compete, the compete for the best total value. since novelty, habit, and probability are the main contenders, and all in all the girls have you guys beat pretty well. know what I mean? I have to eventually go the highest total novelty. the lesser three contribute to novelty, but not directly. they're just things that determine the amplitude of the novelty when it's attracted.

you can also think of novelty as a major change in timeline. that novelty forever changed the trajectory throuh timeline, so more novelty means you're not really on the same timeline.

I've really been thinking about the conditional-time-straighteners and the "improve the past" slogans, and I'm convinced there's something to it. it's pretty likely there will be a battle you could imagine in the past, to try and fix the events how they were so that some of the "bad-guys" can slip through history undetected, so as to having made no discernable vibration, they'll enter the next dimension undetected, giving us free contrast. don't wanna go without that extra novelty, ya know. too abstract, I know.

in resume, I have to keep doing max contrast on my end until I don't have to anymore.

### 2022-09-16 10:29 - not-good-enoughness is like desire

when you consider that when you have sufficient not-good-enoughness, it produces good-enoughness.

to illustrate, I'm the king of not-good-enoughness. from their (the girls) perspective, nothing is ever good enough, but from my perspective, I just want to find my connection.

it's only when I've found enough connection that I feel good-enoughness, and then that is when I'm ready. I can see how from their perspective it looks like I never think it's good enough. it's always good-enough from a high enough perspective.

there's something more to be said about this, but it has escaped me.

### 2022-09-16 10:39 - I think I've pretty much set my goal

so I was thinking about it a bit outside, and there are other options for starting out, but I do believe that I do want to end up in this sort of reality matrix. I think it is the worst possible manifestation for the "popular" vote.

along the way to get there, it'd be really fun to make it even worse. I don't have to do anything. they already have to try and prevent it, so they have to come up with something that will (apparently) try and prevent this WPM, but it's always the case that when making action against sometihng you make the concept that created that thing stronger, so even their best efforts will produce even more WPM.

I figure that after some time they'll really be in a huge pickle, which is good because they don't need to actually do anything for survival because they can't get it wrong. they'll be inextricably linked to our dimension above, so no matter how hard they try to mess it up, they can't.

if they want to get out of the power structure, they won't be able to, so they'll have to figure out how to make their own dimension. a demiurge of maximum capacity.

that way they'll have their own private dimension and also the girls will have their own dimension. when the population becomes a global population, competition will arise in seeming physical dissimilarity (race, colour, gender, etc.), and so this provides for a perfect factioning to begin besides just the binary opposites (my <|not >same or preferred race/colour/gender). they're actually kind of the same dimension, but two different perspectives into it. nosebook from a masculine perspective and nosebook from a feminine perspective (and both of their subsequent perspectives/definitions of all demographics through statistics). in reality neither is even close to reality, but it will shape our reality to their expectations.

### 2022-09-16 10:57 - I wonder the validity of this

I'm listening to a korolova mix and one guy commented that the two things were not well mixed because somehow the slider got left in the middle or something. the guy commented "amateure hour" and so as I was feeling out the thought, I was reminded of st-michaels-work, where his whole job is to keep us all focused on the hymnal.

the picture I had is that these different performers are out there doing things, but their vision has gotten so detailed, that reality is starting to kinda like melt out and it's so hard to stay focused on reality because the only thing they can see is theirself (this is kinda what the start of 5d is sorta like).

so they're having all these problems trying to keep it together, and the ones that know how to not look at theirself too seriously are the ones that are doing well.

it has to do with the way that we care about what others think, but if you think about it, it also manifests as not-good-enoughness. I can look out and see other people doing amazing things, but I can't myself, so I'm probably not good enough to do it.

that's kind of a weird one that disguises itself as not-good-enoughness, but really it's caring too much what others think.

### 2022-09-16 12:53 - a valid concern on narration

this idea goes something like this: right now I'm sorta the narrator of what's happening in the world. if I come out into public, that changes.

same with if I go with the girls. they'll take over a lot of my narration for me (I would hope, anyway).

something to keep in mind. the idea that just came to me is that if we invented a new way to narrate, and by doing that, we're completely leaving the narration to the other narrators.

this will largely set the dividing line between dimensions, and the deciding factor is what narrative they're listening to. imagine the offset on that one: imagine a person that has a very open mind but they're listening to a closed-mind narrator. they get to the side they're going and realise it was all a sham. I think that means I'm going that I'm going to the opposite of that, so I'm going to be the most open minded individual, but in a world built by the narrators. which are my narrators?

some individuals want to be my narrators. I don't see anything wrong with that. it's just more contrast for me. each of these narrated worlds I don't really see, so they have to find ways of integrating me into those other narratives.

so if I go with the girls, they lose connection to my narrative. that's their main concern.

I say let them have some control over my narrative because narrative is really quite funny when the narrators don't have a clue what's actually happening. it's probably pretty comedic, honestly.

---

I'm still trying to figure out how to integrate my future in. I was thinking about how I was going to define it for people and I was thinking about really maybe doing some statistical analysis on it, maybe some risk assessment, and projections. that'd be really awesome.

once we've figured it out statistically, we can just use that as a sorta joke later, kinda like how they were actually our minimum expectations. for me though it's going to be pretty fun because I think probabilities don't really exist (as weird as that sounds).

to explain how I don't think that probabilities don't exist I have to demonstrate by example: we need to build up imaginary scenarios (a set of expectations) and then figure out the statistical probability of meeting another set of expectations in X amount of time. most of the time it'll fail (or, at least I would hope so).

---

my reality was constructed out of symbols and I'll have to pay for that offset later on, but your reality is constructed out of possibilities, and so, you'll probably have to pay for that later on, as well.

these sorts of offsets stack up extra of this opposite to novelty stuff (habit, contrast, probabilities, but there was a fourth one I can't remember now). those things produce instability in the next form of perception and so that becomes the "seed contrast" for the next dimension. so it's probably planned/inteded.

---

I explained the fourth opposite to novelty yesterday, but it got erased I believe (or perhaps other timeline), but the fact remains that I'm still unable to locate it, so it's time to update the concept. whenever a concept goes away from my mind, I have to find a new way to get to the same concept again (so I can explain it), so that means that I get better at getting to a concept. I'll think of it again soon enough, and probably better the next time too. as such, I don't mind having to get to a concept again from more and more unique ways. I'm good at getting around stuff (like physical laws, of science).

it's probably one of the aspects with an extra dimension (resistance -> programmable resistance)

### 2022-09-16 17:27 - different domains of reality

one of the things I could see is that we're going to need narrators to keep up the contrast. then, I could see that we all would supply sort of "reality domains" and these would be run various reality marketing companies.

I don't remember the rest.

### 2022-09-18 03:30 - the trance or drug state

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/tRvko3rCCAU)

these states are one way to achieve an altered state of consciousness, but I know for certain that I do not want to make any manifestation when I'm stoned or under the influence of anything, so if you want me making conscious and clear decisions, I want to go sober. then the idea was that nosebook does *not* want me making conscious decisions, so they do actually want me stoned. I don't want to be stoned because that totally sucks. also, if stoned it's definitely something we'll pay for later, of course.

### 2022-09-18 03:47 - desire is produced from unwanted

the ability to perceive unwanted isn't learned for a bit. you can produce symbolic states for wanted and symbolic states for unwanted as well, and this is basically the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (both in present and future projections/predictions).

so I really only refine my ability to perceive unwanted over time. unwanted is a symbolic construct just like wanted so it's easy for me to see now that there is no good or bad anymore; you just see it for what it is.

in 4d, everything still has a singular angle to it, but in 5d, you see it for what it is (from all apprropriate angles at once), rathar than only as it appears to be from any point in time or space (the illusion). this is pure desire.

though my eyes don't see in 5d, I am still "there" just without visuals. not being able to see it, is actually extremely helpful. I would get lost in the images, I imagine.

I wonder if I had images turned back on, I would turn into a mr-motor (yanono). that's crazy: the only difference between us is perhaps he sees images and I don't. I wonder if my different perspective on the image (cause I can only feel it) probably has transformed some of the rendering of the rendering of his perspectives. interesting.

another interesting thing to observe on this one is that means in the next dimension, I'm the "bad-guy" cause my images are on and I can really imagine some terrible things that I probably am not born with the capability of seeing through to notice that all that matters is how I *feel*; it doesn't have anything to do with the image.

### 2022-09-18 06:34 - if you insist on going through under the influence,

I'd obviously want to spend a time *not* under the influence. I really like being sober. I like being clear-headed. I really don't like the feeling of being stoned for much more time than I have to. I feel like I got the message.

you know there is a good quote from a friend of mine that said, that once you've got the message you can hang up; you don't need to keep talking.

I got the message; I don't need to keep talking.

### 2022-09-18 07:01 - just let it all fall apart

I think it's best to just let it all fall apart. the stuff that needs to be preserved will make it through, so there's nothing to worry about.

the *only* other option to that is to maintain constant contrast and we next logical step/state it all the way to wherever it is we want to go. it's literally the fastest way too because all other manifestions are slightly less contrast.

### 2022-09-18 07:42 - be careful of how fast you attract

I noticed a few reactions wondering why I'm having a change in appearance, and I belive it's cause I have such low resistance, what's happening is the getting there too fast is manifesting me as being a bit pushy or bossy. I literally have no control other than to just feel good about whatever it is, knowing that it's all attraction, anyway.

in general, I think this is a good skill to learn sexually, too because it's like really hard to hold when you're pulling in so hard, but if you relax and then when finally ready pull in, then it's easier for both. the pulling in is the attraction power, and the finally ready is when you know with certaintly that it's just obvious what happens next. one is trying too hard, the other is more like pounceing.

---

I also appear to respond in more and more manner of fact ways. this, I've complained about before is because our language does not have a "this is how I see it (though it may be wrong)"... so:

- "this is how I see it (though it may be wrong)"
- this is the <most|least|amount> likely thing to happen
- this is the way I think "they" see it
- this is <amount> likely to happen

I will try and be less manner of fact, but from this perspective I see things as abosolutes. they either don't interact with the rules or they do and are delt with. this way is weird, I know I need to hang up the phone. anyway, it's cool because in my perspective, I can only find a way to feel good at whatever is happening, going too fast or too slow. it all has to be perceived as just the next logical thing, anyway.

I may also be messing with their minds a bit to throw out a few bad ideas to get those ones shot down quickly (easy wins feel like progress). who knows. at this point, I have so many "steering mechanisms" for me in place, I basically just feel good about whatever is happening. sometimes it comes out as a joke and other times as an apparant joke for me. sometimes I don't see it at all. I'm nearly blind, ya know.

[song: you keep holding back; don't hold back]

so the thing is I not holding back. I have a constant speed system, and so if attraction gets too fast, it comes out as assertiveness, but if I'm attracted too slowly, I suppose a number of things could happen -- all within my realm of belief. all of the things that I think are believable, can happen. when I'm holding back, that's because there's too much attraction. too little attraction and things get passive (like a worker at an unfun job).

I don't have to worry from my perspective because we get there when we get there. it's an autobalancing system, so I/we can't get there any faster or slower.

it's the slowest (because it does all the WPMs), but also the fastest (because it has so much experience/karma).

### 2022-09-18 15:16 - the manifestation reverse feedback loop

today (or maybe it was yesterday) I noticed another thing about having a more universal perspective, and that is that everything must be constant. the increment is the same (it's basically the clock signal), but the magnitude for each interval can be quite varying. each increment also contains a symbolic language to it which each set of symbols is connected to a "knowing" or "understanding" of how the symbols work together. so that allows you to encode logic into the symbolic access of concepts.

what that means from my perspective is I have to get to constant contrast across each interval. this is the only way that I can bypass the logic. from their perspective, they're looking to "figure me out" and like the astrologers of old, they were interested in figuring out the best predictors (alignments and stuf) are for certain goals and/or worries. so, they encode this symbolic access into all of their symbols -- and probably lock everyone not in the group access to the concepts -- which actually means that we all get to find a new way to this form of perception. I guarantee the weed access point will be properly filtered and regulated, cause that's what they do. they don't want it easy for anyone else to figure out what I know. while on the topic, that's probably the main reason they don't want sex, because it would instantly give a lot of others access to new concepts they previously didn't have access to (I wrote about this in a past entry, but I can't remember where now)

in short, when things are going too slow, good things (wanted) start to happen in order to speed it up. however, if we're going too fast, bad things (unwanted) start to happen.

one idea is to try pushing me too fast for a bit so that I get out a lot of bad stuff, but then later when approaching the manifestation, slow me way back down again to constant contrast.

### 2022-09-19 15:59 - what are the implications?

I'd like to ponder for a moment what some of the implications of me realising that I am the universe.

first, most notably, that means that I am on my return back to source, which means, try as hard as you want to try and stop it, I will continue to rise in frequency until I fully am able to realise myself as that. I'm basically completely unstoppable.

many others who also see thierselves that way will continue on with me. we are the universe (in process of manifestation).

if I now think of myself as the sperm that's going into the next universe egg, then what *is* the universe? I figure it's one of those feminine reality matrixes, so I have to imagine that they'll keep working on a bigger and bigger reality the larger our consciousness can conceive of ourselves.

one such stop along the way to realising that I am the universe, is realising that "I" am a galaxy. I am a person. I am a planet. etc. I think the dividing line between these concepts there are other conceptual/feminine reality matrixes. you have spatial types of matrixes and you have organisational ways to look at the same universe (maths, sciences, etc). each of these systems organises thought inside of it to maintain its own structure (every organisation is self-serving).

this barrier can be looked at conceptuaally is selfishness. where does self end and begin when I'm looking at someone and I see their manifestation as something that I'm really glad they're having, right? the opposite to this is, "that's not my problem" -- see how both are an entrance into and also an exit out of the reality matrix.

if I'm concerned with the manifestation of others around me (good or bad), I'm in the side of needing to be glad for the other person like a parent would be glad for their child to have a good manifestation; my self is now perceived as so far outside of myself, I see all of you all as aspects of myself. I'm glad for everything everybody gets cause it's a perfect refection of that aspect of myself (that's why I used the example formerly of parenting/husbandry).

these aspects (you all) are all just finding their own way at their own pace. I know they'll all make it just fine (cause they're still with me in some way connected to me), so I'm like yeah, they'll all figure it all out at their own pace: "not my problem".

let's get back to the aspects of myself part because this is confusing to some. anyone can do it. so, if I figure out that I am the universe, well, then wouldn't all of everything around me reflect me and how I am, so therefore, wouldn't it then be fairly obvious that the stars, planets, moons, etc. all be transforming as a reflection of me? seems obvious. what's stopping you from thinking the same about me or anyone else? it's a reference frame for the mental imagery. that's probably why my vision keeps expanding -- because of that "frame of reference" (aura) keeps getting bigger.

anyone who thinks they're the universe has to have enough hubris to believe that he influences his reality. he would also be so preposrous as to believe that evevery single thing out there is a reflection of him -- everything out to the galaxies and superclusters or whatever. that's pretty crazy, right? who in the world would *ever* come to realise such hubris?

I guess I'm out of the closet now. lol. somebody's got to do it. everyone will stay (depart the train) at the size they feel comfortable in. in my perspective, they are my perspective (concept of who they are) *minus* the limitng beliefs that they hold about theirself; more contrast the better. somone has to design these barriers, and that seems to be the "femininine" form of thought. design your own reality how you want it to be. I won't really carry on this subject in conversation. if someone wants to bring it up, it's fine, but it really is a *self-knowing* that everything in reality reflects you. you are also completely unstoppable (you're litterally on an unstoppable journey back to the source of who you think you are). if I set my mind to it, I can get it. my desire alone is sufficient.

---

everyone will design their own realities. the most rigid, of course will be your more totalitarian and authoritarian realities. their reality model sees threats and has te neutralise those threats. no problem. they're all designing their own reality to their own specifictions. some will stay at this reality right now. some will continue on to the next one we make as well.

from my perspective, I keep attracting new ways to codify my reality into a new universe that I will then be seeded into. they're all just reflections of my perspective, which is why they're designing the one above that, and so fourth -- until we run out of ideas and we have to finally live in the reality we made for ourselves. you have to "dog food" your own code.

the "reality technicians" are coding this reality just like a woman "codes the reality" of the reality matrix the child is born into, does that, so do eventually we have to live inside of own creations. they're there to punish me to eventually have to live out my own reality the way I perceived it to be. so, then I'm coding eventually for a whole new universe reality matrix. starting small and working our way up. eventually, we'll run out of reality definitions for it and reality disappears. we've gone to 5d. to ensure we can still interact with this reality and still remain in *physical* proximity to the conepts that you love, all those need to be rendered into sense (see, smell, taste, touch, and potentially new ones too soon), so you see that because we want so much to be able to *see* the manifestation, we *need* to see it.

we're the guy on the matrix that gives up the location of the nebu-chad-nezzar to special agent smith for a steak. we want the matrix.

unlike cypher, I know that, like the universe, reality is a reflection of me.

---

OMG, totally derailed. this totally happens to me all the time. I was talking about implications and then did a "rabbithole".

brb.

### 2022-09-19 17:08 - my way is the right way

is the correct perspective to have.

then, just let experience smoothe off some of the rough edges until your perspective is a sphere.

---

other classics are, "my concepts the only things that exist in the universe" or "my definition is the right one", or "what I believe is right, is right"

these are all classic symptoms of someone who thinks they're the universe.

### 2022-09-19 17:35 - more implications

it means the feminine reality matrix that exists presently only goes up to 5d (6d if rudolf is right), will begin to disappear more  and more in my perception. it's pretty easy to see when there are such wide gaps between ideas. so, reality should begin to start to transform into something that does not have a fachada anymore. a sort of knowing or emotional sense of reality. like me, the 3d fachada is still visible and stuff, but I've "gone airbore" you know how like when water evapourates, it has enough energy to remain fixed to the material reality of whatever the water was stuck to. if that's happened, it justt means your upward velocity is now more than the downward velocity.

the downward velocity can now only be experienced in interactions with other people. other than that, you're going to live forever, or until you decide "here is good enough for me" and you're reality will reflect your perception of it (we all code our own reality), so we're all living the reality we create, and some people will decide it's "good enough" for them. we, however, are plagued with eternal not-good-enoughness, so we can *always* see an improvement in there somewhere. max novelty.

### 2022-09-19 17:48 - do you ever wonder...

... if alien civilisations just take human genome and put it on a planet and then spectate them and see (analyse) the process it takes for a human to make it's trip "back to the source", and they're laughing at us and commenting on us at how noob all the fails along the way were. like we're the failure that they all like making fun of?

### 2022-09-19 17:57 - do you ever wonder...

... what the manifestation would have been if I hadn't smoked the joint? does someone ever want to go back to experience the difference to see what life would have been like if I delayed it even longer? maxine-foot-dragon?

### 2022-09-19 18:04 - that may have been the first thing I regretted

smoking that joint is probably one of the first things I've ever to have really regretted. I thought I regretted raquel for a whole, but not really. I didn't, and don't feel regret about anything ever, so why do I feel regret about this?

you know, I do suppose I would go back to having never smoked the joint, honestly. I'm going to pretend as if it had never happened. sometimes it's best not to tell others what you see, right? we'll see how that goes. like jerry with keeping abraham a secret because it's weird, I don't think it'll stay a secret too long. as long as you want.

### 2022-09-19 18:09 - maybe I regret writing about it

the world will never be the same.

### 2022-09-19 18:11 - fake it till you make it?

I know a buncha posers gonna be out there pretending to see it too, so maybe just fake it till you make it? you'll get there.

### 2022-09-19 18:14 - everyone is just a reflection of me

all the posers are a reflection of me.

### 2022-09-19 19:27 - do over

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x7Mph8oOIg)

cause I kinda do, you know. I really do wonder a lot what life would have been like if I hadn't have smoked.

it's no secret that psychedellics are the biggest ego builders, and if you don't grow with the size of the ego, the joints loose their effectiveness.

if I could go back to not having smoked, I would -- but, if you think about it, I'm just the stage magician, keeping you all busy with stuff to see as they install the new matrix.

they're playing me like a puppet of their expectations. being at nearly zero resistance, I can't *not do* the things the most influential LOA voters expect me to do. I do what they expect me to do. I experienced an idea on 2022-09-10 and I went with it. from basically that point on, I'm completely floating now; I'm 100% at the mercy of their expectations.

so, by going back, I get to regain my control. it's a control thing. then, I had full control, but like this, they control me completely with their expectations.

this is going to make a splash.

### 2022-09-19 19:38 - how long of a flight are we on?

like seriously, what do you guys expect to happen?

### 2022-09-19 19:40 - I really like the time 19:38

it's one of those things where I just like it because it's double on one side, but it's also the same day number

### 2022-09-19 20:08 - do you wonder if celebration is bad?

I walked in from outside and jaron is watching austin powers and he drives into some place with a bunch of "swinger" women around, and he has his "woah" face on.

this reminded me of jesus going into -- palm sunday, I believe -- they all celebrate him and his awesomeness, right before he got crucified. the celebration, no matter how many swinger chicks allowed is just another bump.

it's not really bad, not really actually any more than a "fake it till I make it" attitude, because they both come from feeling better physically than what I'm ready for. or, feeling different than how I expect to. or, feeling a way about something physical that I'm expected to feel (cause I'm a society actor).

my job is just to keep discovering/noticing what I like.

### 2022-09-19 20:14 - I don't prefer celebration

I prefer to just go back to reality-kenny as if nothing happened, which is *obviously* what I'm going to do. haven't you seen how easy it is just to feel the way I want. I prefer to just focus on something mundane while my mind is elsewhere.

connect? let's see, reality-kenny is focusing on something mundane. I just let him sorta operate all of the basic stuff anyway. reality-kenny doesn't really perceive those thoughts because they're too high vibration, and don't have easy english concept way to put them into reality, this the strong influencers of this reality matrix aren't ready to let such a concept become physical, so we keep to the material reality.

though this perspective exists, I prefer to enjoy the perspective of action-kenny. down there, I don't have to worry about anything other than now, because I already know where I'm going anyway (nobody can stop me). from action-kenny's perspective I can do whatever I feel like doing, so I pay most attention to how I feel, and when I'm feeling pretty poorly, I find a way to limit myself from making action.

reality-kenny is the feeling version of action-kenny.
action-kenny turns on when I don't feel too good;
reality-kenny is on the rest of the time.
reality-kenny just feels the way he wants about the experience.
reality-kenny leaves *all* action to instead be reaction.
(because I'm attracting everything toward me)
(every *reaction* is a reflection of how I feel)

### 2022-09-19 20:33 - the secret

we can just keep all of this a secret.
that way others can believe it too and be secret about it.
if anyone who wants to join in, they can
nobody actually knows who the members are,
so anyone be a member, as it's probably a secret.
so if we all keep the "I'm the universe" thing a secret.
that way anyone can be a member.

I felt like I repeated myself.
it is a circular concept and very fast moving,
hard to describe in long sentences.
[the manifestation](/the-manifestation.md) *is* the secret

### 2022-09-19 21:11 - cause like you know...

... it would be weird if I were telling people what to do and stuff, so I figure if I just never talk about it, it's sorta like how I was when I was little and I didn't offer information. I kept things that I believed about myself a secret. it wasn't able to be kept a secret. it just creates such a problem when I interface with someone else because they can't fathom how much I actually like being me. nobody understands that, ya know.

I don't want to ever tell people what to think, so I feel so weird revealing my own thought patterns, but I figure that since you already have my thought patterns anyway, why not just say them in words. I figure it's probably the first time anyone has ever done this since edward de vere (I am that I am). you can imagine how strange it is to reveal my own thought patterns to the observers.

I'm just saying that I'd always sorta kept my really high opinion of myself a secret. everybody is all about taking psychedellics to "lose" their ego, but I think of it as *gaining* my ego, rathar than losing it. I wondered if one could gain one's virginity, rathar than losing it. weird idea.

it's pretty easy to keep that a secret because reality-kenny is so good at just staying right range in a range of environments, that nobody really observes the "self-centred" thoughts that I have all of the time. I don't really think I'm the only person that thinks they're the centre of the universe though. I'm fairly certain that almost everbody does, unless culture and expectations has restricted it -- therefore, I think that pretty much thinks they are the centre of the universe. which is just about right, if it were true.

I suppose we should all just sorta keep it a secret. exclusive invite-only club.

you have to be invited by someone to join the club of those that believe that they create their own reality.

### 2022-09-19 21:35 - what's obviously happening

imagine a cosmic ray that's traveling at such a tremendous speed (way way way faster than light) and my body has been made to be the attractor of it. I'm not the only one that will get the consciousness. out before it, imagine these pressure waves -- sort of like sonic booms that are traveling out ahead of it in the medium, but because it's so fast, all of the mediums below that particle bunch up so you have this cascade of events that are created symbolically as a sort of preparation for its arrival into the medium (the singularity). the physical effects, will be some of the last to arrive.

it's not really a cosmic particle. I just like to imagine it as the fastest particle in the universe because it has the most contrast in all of its experience (source, the ancestors, all that is, etc).

before the physical effects will arrive, there will be random desire to just try some new things out (I think of this as the 60s but there are smaller waves surrounding it).

OK, so I just realised that I should be explaining that over the years I've given a lot of thought to novelty theory and what is it's "real" (physical) interaction with this reality. this is an attempt to explain it.

novelty theory has this fractal structure to it where you see the same signature repeated over and over in self-similar waves (think zooming into a mandelbrot). I really think that what we're actually looking at is a sort of wave front or something like a "sonic boom" of a collision between medium speeds.

so now, let's just assume that terence's timewave was an accurate representation of the wavefront, then the frequency can be calculated if you were to know the speed of the last outside medium in the prior (solar?) regime (not 100% about this). oh, maybe it's something like the spectrum of the sun, and so that is increasing now to a point where it wasn't in the previous solar regime. we'll float around in the frequency of our attraction. the higher the frequency of the attraction, the higher the frequency of the sun's spectrum it's outputting (gamma and higher by now I suspect). the new "timewave" can then be calculated as another this self-similar vibrational signature. I don't know the dimensional complexity (whatever you want I guess), and then that is *your* timewave. adjust it until your daily events fit the novelty graph. oops, derailed.

where was I... oh yes, OK, out in front of this particle there will be mediums of faster and faster speeds. this would normally just turn LOA on hyperdrive. I'm the opposite of that, which is that I disintegrate reality by making everything next logical step/state. for me, what's real is no longer the physical stuff, so reality starts to disintegrate rapidly.

there are a lot of people invested in the reality matrix that we're in now, so to avoid reality disappearing entirely, a new "physical" reality matrix will exist. it'll have way better graphics; something, I'm apparently pretty good at doing, probably because I never "see" it. we're all the ones that didn't have any faith.

for me, I know that I gatta see it before I believe it type of person. I know there are a lot of others with this "problem" as well. I like not seeing so much that I want to keep it going. I don't really *need* to see it. the longer I can continue to not see, the better it is for me, because then I don't ever visualise my reality, but instead I just create it in the moment. for me, more than images, I like the 3d reality because I don't really have to look at it which gives me the freedom to feel so much.

if I get distracted from who I am and start to give too much importance to this reflection of myself, reality -- then, I lose track of who I am and have to live out that reality that I created. inotherwords, they have to build a new matrix because they too have a heap of baggage that they've got to get through "undetected". they're no different than nosebook. that desire to find a way to sneak through to the next dimension/galaxy/universe in a padded environment is the seed contrast for the next whatever. inotherwords, nosebook, the female mind and culture all have the same christ perspective of not-good-enoughness and wanting to preserve and help those less-than (to their detriment). it's only when you forsake those ridiculous ideas and see yourself as good enough (mediocrates) are you reborn into the reality matrix you perceived for myself. I put myself in this jail, because it was fun. oh, I make my own reality. duh.

### 2022-09-23 22:45 - seems there are some ...

I have been paying attention to what [I just wrote in novelty-theory](/concepts/novelty-theory.md#2022-09-23-1942---forethought-and-afterthought-are-both-feelings) because in it I was talking about how the ability to produce events for oneself is a very interesting thought. as one of the examples, I used marc because of his ability to talk whilist doing a million things at once, meanwhile he's even able to adapt his strategy. he's completely on autopilot and because of so much practise, he's just interacting with the macro things. each macro thing is easy because he can see the events that produce kind of like action triggers. it appears to be entirely emotion based (just like emotional triggers). unfortunately, it appears that this (at least for him) is a right-hemisphere thing, and mine is kinda like shut down, so multitasking is very difficult for me.

anyway, I'm not useless, and my left-side's capability to get better at stuff is increasing. I'm not sure if my right-hemisphere is activating again or if I'm building up the same capability in the left-hemisphere. I think it's perhaps the latter.

at any rate, one of the ideas I have is to actully work on getting that capacity back in my right-hemisphere. I know that nosebook has occupied my that hemisphere, and it doesn't really bother me. however, what I do like about the manifestation path that I'm on now (reality-kenny and just feeling my way through the process) is that it gives me more time.

one of the main issues that I have and a lot of my source of not-good-enoughness is remaining in a disconnected state. I know that in a connected state my right-hemisphere is going to be working so I can do that thing that marc does where I just control my body from a macro perspective. the other times that I've experienced it, it came along with a pretty dramatic change in position that I view myself.

you'll also notice that when I'm stoned, I perceive things much more from the 3rd person perspective, saying "you" and "he" a lot more, because I'm kinda outside of myself looking inward at myself watching me perform the actions. so, obviously that's something that's natural to me.

---

I said all of that because I noticed that there is a lot of difficulty around me and talking about science or carbon or any types of technology. I think they're trying to force a manifestation, and it's likely to happen anyway that the girls will activate my right-hemisphere, so I'm not really worried about it.

at the same time there are others that are really worried about me getting out into the public where it's much harder to control the media, so they're also quite interested in me not doing anything with any marketing or anything like that. ideas are dangerous and they could really unsettle their setup.

on top of all of that, they definitely don't want any technology coming out. [yesterday I proposed the idea of looking at the manifestation from a purely business/money/self-worth perspective](), and I think that wasn't too well received either. they definitely don't want any of that technology to actually get into the hands of the consumer.

this got me thinking about the future in which many advances in technology mean that we're not just earth and a star and some planets, but earth has figured out how to use the sun's power to power all sorts of things. creating stars is now something we can do, and they're using that technology of moving atoms around to create even up to planets. I know that I would enjoy figuring out a lot more things in genetics, because if DNA *is* a reflection of perception, I want to invent a whole bunch of species that see things very strangely and figure out an environment that is suitable for them to become conscious beings as well. providing the biology for these planets seems really cool of an idea for me.

---

everyone keeps trying to think of everything as happening now, and people think that this is *forethought* but it is not. it's just an image. I've really started to dig in mentally to this peruvian[^1] form of vision, because it's not at all european. it's funny how [in that definition](), I basically said that forethought is the feeling that brought the thought, and afterthouht is the way that I feel about the thought -- so that means that forethought is just letting everything happen the way it's going to happen and feeling good about whatever it is. I know that desire is a lot more powerful than trying to think it all through and anticipate the best. just enjoy the process

about "peruvian imagination" (or lack thereof) -- I first noticed it when I was at alfredo's bar, but I didn't put words to it till tejidos diana. having known mauricio (he's colombian but had imagination), I associate that lack of imagination with the peruvians (specifically the more indigenous ones). I think it's quite possible that imagination in relation to desire may be an "aryan" trait, most significantly that we have something that we want and so then using images, we try and figure out the way to get that desire.

though that capability is what most would think of as "forethought", I don't see it at all this way. forthought for me is the constant emotional feedback I get *before* I think a thought and I know ahead of time if I'll like it or not. my new way of forethought is probably the expansion that our race is going through, and it's because concept and feeling comes before thought, and I believe what I've been developing is *very* superior to aryan forethought.

hey that's kinda cool. I know a lot of people associate water with emotions (I associate air), so it's kind of a cool coincidence that aryan forethought is imaginative, and aquarian forethought is in-the-moment feeling feedback. get it? air-ian is imagination and aqua-rian thought is emotions (it's backwards). I would have said that air-ian thought is emotion based and aquarian is picture based because I associate the imagination with water.

to really outdo myself, I think it's a really cool idea to develop that multi-tasking event producing capability in my left-hemisphere as well, so that I can perform like somone connected while still remaining disconected. they can't shut down my left-hemisphere as well (else I'd be in a coma), so if I just figure it out, I can do it all. this is kinda something I want to do, and the nice thing is it works really good for everyone too.

### 2022-09-24 08:06 - I woke up thinking about the previous entry

it's quite possible that these are definitely nosebook ideas, but I'd like to share them anyway. I woke up thinking about the "worst" manifestation, which would be -- I mentioned that I don't really make decisions anymore and instead just feel good about whatever -- which is what I'm kinda doing in this entry, too. well, the implication here is that nosebook is probably going to try and stick me in their "least bad" situation, which is sorta not that bad really, which is probably no older girls (so no children) and also they're going to want to try and steer the girls to keep me away from "important" things like technology and creativity.

this sounds prety miserable to me just on the surface. I already dislike girls in general because it's impossible to get anything creative done with them around, so that will only compound that problem if I continue to see it that way (which is quite likely because that's what I'm attracting and that's probably what nosebook wants -- is some sort of proxy control to keep me away from technology).

the other reason why it sounds miserable to me is I don't know how to have high-level thought. to a large extent, my capablity to think and reason is often times a reflection of the person I'm interacting with. you'll notice that after watching a jason jorjani video, I'm quite a bit more capable of rendering philosophical thought into coherent form. I really like that, and I really like learning new things from myself in that way. if I'm confined to their thought capability, it feels like I'm constantly struggling to express myself. in general, I've found it nearly impossible to actually have any intelligent conversation with girls ever. I much prefer to listen to them and study them than to converse because -- I dunno, it's like they don't have an ability to see things on the horizon or something. I haven't quite figured out what it is exactly, but one thing I've never really experienced -- cept for once which was xyla explaining lindsey's method for clearing a space out, and I'm not sure she explained the mental process that occurs when you have to replace everything in the room, though I seemed to have picked up on her unspoken words -- is that girls have never been able to explain what is actually going on in their heads. the mental process is alway elusive, so it's caused me to try and figure them out to figure out their mental processes.

the most frustrating thing for me about this is that I don't actually get to figure it out. I mentioned in a few previous entries that I find that nosebook is very very similar to feminine thought in the nature of its character, and so it's no surprise that the technology that is capable of looking inside of their heads is also restricted from me. it seems that I'll never be able to figure it out either by asking them or by using technology.

the other thing I mentioned is that I really like the idea of starting to use my left-hand more and try to see if I can't duplicate all of the right-hemisphere capabilities in my left -- however, in addition to all of that, I really want to just go at it myself. I want to figure it all out myself and do all of it. girls are fine, but they're kind of a bait. they're not what I really want. I think I really want to just keep going on all of my stuff, and do it *my* way, which is by attraction and a very dynamic personality (I change pretty rapidly in comparison to others). I *know* that attraction is much much more powerful than secrets and trying to withhold information, so I figure I'll just do that. you guys can all figure out your own attraction. as I keep evading nosebook's advances, I notice they keep getting stronger, so eventually nobody will even notice that their lives are completely controlled. not my problem.

tl;dr - I think the way that the right-hemisphere has some pretty incredible capabilities to it, including time travel and other such things, but it's very undesibable for the establishment for anyone to be able to actually use that part of their brain for technical stuff (singularity technologies). this is probably been why women have been kept logically in the dark for so long. it seems likely for me especially they want the right-hemisphere (probably the location of my brain's feminine thought) to continue to remain ellusive for me. I want to have it though and even improve upon it. so, I plan on duplicating the right-hemisphere's brain in my left with all of the improvements I've come up with, but I'm going to go the masculine route to get there (I'm doing it my way. nobody can help me. I'm the centre of my own universe).

### 2022-09-24 19:52 - come just as I am

I noticed a meta theme happening. in one of the songs on "daughters of the dawn", they say "come just as you are", which is sort of like come even though you're not ready -- I took it sort of like, don't worry we'll sortof absorb the impact (this is least manifestation). which is in contrast to all of the other manifestations where there is all of this idea for a purpose or goal.

so, the meta theme is not really one of readyness, but instead of ... man I can't think it so well with them playing. let me try to penetrate the thought spectrum. right, instead of readyness, the subject is about how large of a manifestation that it is.

---

to talk about this, I'd like to introduce the concept of conditional-time-straighteners. imagine for a moment that they want to find a way to pass certain entities through the changeover in dimensions, but give them an artificial reality, for which this is the new dimensional pet. just like we have animals that get domesticated, this is the same thing when upgrading to a higher dimension perspective (like now). they program the reality and they like some pets to come along

now, imagine for a moment that they can move around in time, so what they're looking for is the most manipulatable timeline, because then it's easier to make constant. as in just imagine trying to make our present times have no real big bouts of contrast; instead, a constant amount of contrast/anti-novelty. their goal is to reorder history so that I make it through without a certain high novelty/anti-novelty creators, I need go the whole way steady without any big amounts of contrast. what that means in practise is, they're interested in always trying to make as little bit of a manifestation as possible.

this is what I'm all about anyway going for the least manifestation all the time.

I tend to agree with that perspective, but I would like to explain that it's not "least" manifestation, it's the "most constrast", because the most contrast is the smallest possible increment of contrasts. the most perfect contrast is a line that's so straight that it's got next to nothing in variation (always around 0), but it oscilllates above and below 0 many many many (uncountable) times faster than visible light. I don't think I'm going to get that kind of precision this time around, but perhaps the next time. I need lots and lots of offsets (uncountably many). for me, it's not the size of the manifestation that happens, it's that there are more than thousands per second (and accelerating). so for me a manifestation only lasts a very tiny fraction of a second, so by extension, they're all so tiny because they last such a short period of time. you know I'm using really conservative numbers. it's quite possible those numbers are larger. just saying.

another way to look at my perspective is, it needs to be next logical step/state, because anything else would be tremendously destabilising for me. smoking has been seen by me as a huge risk for me because historically I had difficulty switching states, so I couldn't just switch in and out. you know, I think that's a skill that ayahuasca and/or mushroom gave me, btw. I simply cannot try and do anything that doesn't feel like next logical step/state in sober state.

### 2022-09-24 20:35 - being responsible for my reality

there is another meta theme happening here and that is, how responsible do I want to be for my reality?

there are various ranges of manifestations that offer more or less than full responsibility, so it's kind of a question of how much I want to be attracting everything that's happening. I don't really try and make any reality happen; nosebook does all of that for me. I just let them sorta pull the levers pretending they're in control because it doesn't really matter to me the order of anything, just that it's a reflection of my desire.

so, for example, I want to sit down and write this, so I do. then, within the the parameters set by the music I'm listening to, my mental state of mind, etc. -- then, they go around swapping things in and out and trying to manipulate it, but in reality they're just micromanaging the actions, as it's just me making the desire to want to do something. they're constrained by the parameters of the situation, but my desire always pulls me in the right direction. it's become so natural to follow those impulses now, that I probably appear to have really good timing, cause my life is beginning more and more to reflect the way that I feel, and so I get to kinda play around like a child does.

you know that for a child, the entire word refelcts how they feel, and so, everything that appears in your reality is just magical, so trying out different emotions just the fun of it. you know, I did this a few times today where I repeated a character but put my sincerity into it, just to see how weird it felt for me to do an "attention whore" techniques or whatever. I just play around with characters just like a child does.

anyway... so, I was talking about getting good at following my impulses, so I just don't understand what is the problem to understand that I just always to "minimise your impact", because making a big splash isn't necessary; I already do it naturally.

### 2022-09-24 21:23 - wierdness funnel

I want to talk about a really strange topic that crossed my mind while I was stoned is that imagine I just decided to just invite lovebites to colorado, and then just see what happens from there. that's the [being responsible for my reality]() part there where I'm saying I'm responsible for the manifestation. on a side note, I do like to think that *evverything* is sorta my fault. it's sorta natural in us, and we have to realise that it *is* all my fault, and that I *do* attract everything. so whatever, let's just say that it happens somehow...

when that idea came into my mind, I noticed that it put a huge dampener on the imagination of the manifestation from the western mindset. I wanted to explain the weirdness of it.

imagine that's the case, you'll then have to see it from the girls' pespective in that now she has to live up to the expectations of something very different. girls learn, and so what'll end up being recorded will be funneled through japanese perception. well it be traditional? will it be funny? is it beauty? cuteness? they have no idea what to expect.

so then now imagine it from a programmer's perspective which is that the japanese perspective will encode the experience, and so forevermore western consciousness will directly influence and be influeced by one another. they obviously have different things in place which are keeping them to their traditions. so, kinda like "in general" for western thought, but american thought will be expecially optimised to blow/flow right through the conceptuaal barrier pretty easily/quickly because of the reasons jason says from the bomb.

[music change]

OK, now see the difference in perspectives now that the music changed, it'll be something like that, where the grinding (lovebites) will be american thought and the new (magnetik one) will be clearer.

how are the arcturian tyrants[^1] treating you?

[1]: this reminded me of the sound of kyle's voice at ty's rants: ty-rants

### 2022-09-24 22:38 - a brief description of my persona

I'm a cosmic foot-dragger. some people that drag their feet can never change. others change on occasion. the difference beteen both of them and me is that I'm always changing. in a realm where change is everything, the one that changes the most often has the highest "novelty". I have to constantly look at the worst possible thing I can think of -- however, over time my opinion on it improves.

---

tiene que tomar el tiempo a modo constante. hay personas que tambien lo soy, pero ellas no se cambian. ella misma en contrario a los demas que no quieren cambiar, ella lo prefiera porque in una capa de existencia donde el cambio is lo normal; el ser que cambia mas que los demas, es el esta accumulando mas novelty (invertiendo a tope). todos los cambios pueden ser grandes or pequenos igual; lo que pasa is que tienen que pasar mas y mas (accelerado) cambioas por segundo/minuto/loquesea. cambio is lo normal. intenta manejar a velocidad pequena para empezar

### 2022-09-25 11:37 - what if I did the whole thing without *any* money

I was thinking about how fame and fortune don't really bother me, and so you could imagine instead of the traditional busninessman, instead now it's perceived as a mooch, living in his mom's basement, that somehow sets off a set of events which have dramatic consequences on human existence.

personally, I really like the idea of no money, because then there's a number to compete over. there always is a number in the cosmic measuring contest, but I personally don't really like the competition, so actually going fully broke the whole way, it shows that you don't need anything other than some words and ideas (that can change the world).

---

just a reminder that from my perspective, I don't really enjoy these types of imaginations, but somehow I'm able to receive them, so it's kinda my fault, and they do serve as more contrast. my job is to just go NLS.

these ideas are kinda fun because they have assumptions built into them, such as assumptions that under whatever circumstance, I would have a lot of money. the comparisons between people over how much money they have builds a lot of restricted thought. I aim to try and avoid as much of that as possible, so I'm saying ahead of time that I don't want to compete. noncompete is a "soverignty" symbol. anyway, I don't really see it as being in any way consequential.

if you look forward into the manifestion further, the picture that emerges in my head is that I become the global villages' shaman. this is perhaps a bit of an improvement on the other version of the manifestation that they had in mind was some sort of "king" where he sits up on his high castle with a flock of girls and shoots out emails between massages. that had the corporate and epstein vibe in it too... anyay, it's fun to me to look at what these manifestations turn into looking down the spectre a bit -- because it illustrates the reversal(?) of desire. remember how [the absence/opposite of what you desire is the message](/concept-log.md#2022-09-05-0804---the-absenceopposite-of-what-you-desire-is-the-message)? well, so when I look at their imaginations of the desire, especially over time, I see a bit of a transition of their identity of me. I think there had been some pretty serious stigma around drugs, and so it's now shown a bit better that there are good uses for it, and so now right on the heels of that revelation that drugs can have some use in the right hands, now perceiving further down the like, I'm more of a consultant (which probably has a cost and a bunch of rules around it), but more than just the business look of a consultant, I'm seen as a visionary and some sort of settler of disputes and all around wiseguy/trickster. that's kind of a much cooler role, and it's much "smaller" of a manifestation too (I don't really want to go too big -- instead I want those that want to go big, to go big. sieze the opportunity, of course).

it's still not quite in my ballpark though, because I'm stuck here in yandwork; and I know, I have to get from where I am to somewhere else easily, and like I mentioned yesterday, I still have some perspectives that need to work theirselves out before I'm "perfected" (good-enoughness); and, until those are worked out, it won't happen. I can't do it until I'm ready and trying to push it is never a good idea. I attract, so trying to push I noticed especially since the reactions from the other day that I don't really like the idea of *not at all* being assertive. so, I probably *won't* be responsible for any of the manifestation. instead, you guys will. it'll be your creation and nobody told you what to do. eventually, it'll work out. I'd almost like to slip through completely unnoticed; as in, never really do anything publically (no need to anyway).

you know, theere was this funny thing that I noticed yesterday in "gems of war" and it's that common, uncommon, and rare are all a rarity. then, epic and legendary are all how significant they are in folklore. after that is mythic which again is another designation all to it's own. it's something so powerful it's not even real; it's only a myth.

### 2022-09-26 08:18 - I got the message

so at the end of yesterday night, it seemed like there was a sort of agreement that was made on a manifestation, which was weird -- because it came to me in this (I'm in a different place, but also here on earth) feeling, and I was back in 11-11-2011 with raquel before we went to see mark's conceert (he was playing in berlin that day, so we went to see him from madrid). anyway, before going to the concert, we hung out in the hotel together. time seemed very strange because when we finally realised we were going to be very late for the concert. somehow something like 1.5h is completely missing and for us it felt like starting to have sex, but then sorta realising we're going to be late and then stopping it. I remember the experience as completely euphoric. it was psychedellic. anyway, the crazy events that happened after that was such a nosedive in our relationship since then. I remember that was 11-11 and by 12-12 I was on the sofa finishing a bottle of whiskey a night myself. it really crashed hard after that event.

though we had such a good time in the hostal before, I felt as if there was a very dramatic change in the timeline from that point on. it's not the first time, because since my haemorrhage, it's felt as if life had these really strong attracting points where I *must* sorta pass through because they're the highest contrast (and novelty).

so yesterday, it felt almost to me as if raquel had self-sabotaged in that moment, and that had sorta summoned an egregore of herself which at that time appeared to me as the manifestation of kyle's daughter. so I feel sorta compelled to just do it. the thing is I have to get there, and the only thing I really know how to do this effectively and smoothely, is to reality-kenny this one. I know where I'm going, so it's just the process of getting back to it.

anyway, seems cool. I sorta like it.

then, I must also relate that this event came upon a strong realisation, that it's actually kind of a good thing if I peace out for a bit, but then the idea is that I come back when I'm 40 to pueblo. that idea also seemed good to me as well, so again, I want to just reality-kenny that one too.

I was explaining yesterday that the reason why I have to do that is because I have to be stable. I can't have too many big things happening at once. I have to go for steady (nothing ever feels too big) NLS. I have many reasons, but I'm not very stable on drugs or alcohol, so I'm going to steer clear from those things. you perhaps can look at it this new way that I'm doing it now.

I felt like I had something that I needed to discover. once I've discovered it, then I want to "hang up the phone". I'll inevitably come back to it in a future stage, I'm sure, but for now this is good. I've got to start to think of myself as the "constant one". thankfully, in a worst case scenario, I'm returning back here in some months anyway... lol

### 2022-09-26 09:00 - haven't drank the coffee yet

I'm also reminded of an idea that I had this morning when I woke up, which was just to sorta *try* and see if I can evitar (slightly different than avoid) the manifestation a little by putting a few of those concepts into visual form and sending them off to derek. I don't really know why that thought amused me so much.

---

because that sounds like so much work to do now. obviously now I'm stoned, but when I woke up, I was not. certain states inhibit realities that would produce undesired emotional states. though it looks like I enjoy them physically, I prefer to avoid those situations vibrationally. when I'm stoned, I navigate vibrationally, so I don't have access to the really soft voice.

---

so, you know how emotions work right? they're these imperceptable (to our eyes) tiny vibrations that cascade into a big thing (like a cosmic ray), they sort of crechendo into the imagination and physical senses (this is all done in the imagination), but the source of these emotions comes from the 5th, not the 6th astral. *higher* vibrations will appear as images and full cinema surround, and *lower* ones appear as pain or physical sensation. between those is all of the emotions and concepts that you can possibly imagine.

your body attracts these things to it. I think we think of the signal pain as the vibration that attracts a lot of low frequency 5th ray concepts into it (which then is received by the brain as signals -- some *higher* and some *lower* depending on the receiving entity cell, etc and the vibration it attracts from the ether).

as such, there is a very big difference between the emotion and the vibrational cascade that comes from it's attraction which our brain receives as a signal and we perceive as pain, touch, etc. you attract everything you feel. the better you get at attracting, the better you feel. it's just that simple. good implementation takes a lot of practise.

---

I would also like to mention that this is the opposite of how you think of atoms and what I'm talking about with "masculine energy", which is just vibrating balls that have a power state. well, that's the exact opposite of what I just discussed above. I discussed emotions from the 5th ray, and the "masculine energy" concept from the 3rd ray perspective. I'm getting better at switching, so as to be able to talk about something from its native (self) perspective.

like, for example, if I talk about emotions from a 3rd ray perspective, it's obvious that different things in the 6th ray imagination are attracting particles of similar vibration, and the cascade that results in response to that attraction is the physical sensation of the emotion.

---

I'd also like to mention that when the cascade is happening, if it's a frequency that is dissonant with human cells, it creates a sort of lower vibration, but if the signal received is harmonic in some way with the cells that are attracting it (probably something like "divine proportions") produces a good harmony, then it's good. one such example of this is gut bacteria. the digestion of food creates emotions a lot the same as other gut bacteria produces emitions. these are like cells that vibrate on certain frequencies, and so often times food (or thought) can produce a frequency that the gut bacteria likes, so it tries to get the organism (you) to eat more of whatever or think more of those kinds of thought, so that emotion can be produced (which the gut bacteria likes). it looks like there is a simbiotic relationship that happens with food where the digestion of it produces a lot of different frequencies and the ones that harmonise, nourish the cell, but the ones that don't will not have enough energy to sustain.

I mean, it's your basic LOA scenario where you crave more of that emotion because the gut baccteria the flourishes is the one that's most well fed.

### 2022-09-28 03:27 - the carbon matrix

sometime this weekend I finally got the fullest picture of "the manifestation" that I ever had have. in short, what I could see is that in the earth's atmosphere (out to quite a distance), a matrix of individul carbon atoms will be floated in concentric spheres around the planet. each of the carbon atoms can be controlled individually with radio frequency using a technology that isn't yet developed. that same technology can enable all sorts of things including flight, and the nice thing about the technology is that it's all attraction and repulsion based, so you can either levitate by having your own atoms vibrate similarly to another set of atoms above or you can vibrate differently than the atoms below you and sorta levitate that way. there's no problem for collisions, because if each person has an individual frequency, atoms can get close (stick and slide) but they'll never "touch" so the maximum you could do is propel your body up to a really high speed then turn the system off (though, I'm sure if you have a velocity, the planetary system will automatically assign you a unique frequency, to ensure no collisions).

inside of this matrix of carbon atoms here on earth, the sky will look like however the controllers want it to look. it'll look like stars and planets and stuff, but they'll just be individually controlled groups of carbon atoms. the way that I saw the different heavanly spheres was as follows.

earth was in the centre, between us and the sun is the moon (like a new moon eclipse). between the moon and the sun is charon and pluto as well. these represented lower density portions of heaven. because the sky is completely constructed, these three moons are all lined up to be in a permanent eclipse, which, according to steiner, really limits the amount of astral vision (that's the point). on the "dark" side of each of these moons is a colony that regulates the energies. I heard that the one on the back of the moon is a legacy one from a long long time ago, and they regulate the 4d realm here on earth. pluto and charon would likewise have similar setups in their "dark sides". the reason for this is that each of these moons creates a sort of "density zone", where the energies of that realm correspond to 2nd (charon), 4th (pluto), and 6th (moon) ray energies. the sun itself transmits and receives 2nd ray energy (which is why I think of the sun as 2nd ray female (isis)). so, for example charon's system will transform the 2nd ray energy into something desirable and usable for the next layer which is the 4th (pluto). their "job" is to ensure that all of this energy is redistributed in a balanced way (4th ray is before time, and time isn't perceived until the astral 6th ray (moon)). you can imagine that the energy needs to be distributed over both time and space in such a way that everything remains in balance. this is where the conditional-time-straighteners are located, obviously. the moon does what the moon has always been doing (no need to upset their setup in any way).

---

I left out a lot of steps along the way, which I don't really know how all of them will be implemented, but essentially, the whole of this plan is to utilise the already present desire in the world leaders to build a compoletely artificial reality where everything is "under control" (from their perspective) and they have full capability to control all aspects of the human narrative.

when considering the power that the 4th rays (conditional-time-straighteners) have, one will begin to see a number of "noble lies" that can and probably will be constructed. for example, my persent situation will almost certainly be rearranged to suit the narrative (whatever it is). so, let's just say that all of the 7 layers of perception is redesigned by the ones in control so that it's not 7 layers of perception, but 7 layers of "reality" which they control and you can explore on the inside and out. the higher planes of reality (between charon and the sun) are, like the 7 layers of perception, largely invisible. the most "visible" and can be talked about is 3rd ray energies which exist between charon and pluto, which we can refer to as logic and pathing from one "reality" to another, but these remain concepts that are not visible or tangible (symbols). from there, these symbols get turned into a narrative that will maintain balance and so fourth... so, for example, imagine some such system is constructed where "desire" is controlled in some way, and you have like reality options which you can move between (by tuning to them, I guess).

so, let's just say that it's decided that humans will have come to the knowledge of these 7 layers of reality through some sort of "natural" process (as in, it was encoded from the beginnning in us or it was our "destiny" to discover it -- some BS like that). well, then that whole system itself is a "noble lie", and in addition the realisation of all of these concepts can be reached in such a way, so as to avoid all taboos (drugs, NDEs, OOBs, etc.) and so therefore a completely sanitised system of perception can be setup in which there allows for no personal exploration at all. this is how it is, and that's it. see it, and see the evidence of it (like the orbit of mercury) and so that "proves" it (taking one out of einstein's playbook here).

---

I figure that once the entire sky can be constructed, we can then consider that the earth may not be in the same position that it is in today. the sun, will be doing what it always wants to do, which is to make an energetic path for all desire to turn into reality. as such, the sun will output more and more as time goes on and though earth itself will continue to look like it does now, the sun will be getting more and more active.

something will need to be done with all that energy, and so from here I estimate that we have a few choices. the first obviously is to just keep pushing the orbit of earth out further and further into solar system. however, I think the "ether drag" will make this considerably more difficult to maintain the illusion, so I figure it's more likely that the earth will stay right where it is, and instead we'll find ways to move that solar energy around and to create with it smaller stars (this is probably charon's job). at the same time, the same technology of floating carbon atoms can be used to gather the proper resources streaming out of the sun in the form of solar wind and to coalesce these together into planets for these stars. these planets can probably have a similar carbon matrix, etc.

I'm just brainstorming here, trying to relate the things that I saw, because in addition to that stuff, I also had this picture of the earth has a sun on the inside of it. this is a mini star, so imagine for a moment that we released that inner sun and it popped out behind us. then some years later, the incoming solar energy has accumulated on the inside of the planet again sufficiently that we let out another sun behind us. this image reminded me of those filaments in the galaxy that sees stars in a line like pears on a necklace. we would have something similar going on.

what this second idea reveals is that earth becomes a sort of "proving ground" where you start on the 7th ray (physical) reality and then through a series of initiations, you begin to work your way up the reality ladder and eventually off-planet. earth becomes the centre of a whole bunch of stars and planets -- so sorta like a galaxy :) gatta have that galaxy...

I left a few parts out, but one can see that this is the perfect way for us to put the increasing solar energy to work while maintaining a "business as usual" nothing extraordinary is happening here, and you're definitely not special sort of mentality for the uninitiated masses, meanwhile all of the big shots all can work really hard creating a plethora of different system for theirselves and for other species (of which I'm very interested in creating and evolving) to live upon.

---

the other option, of course is to maintain "business as usual" for the whole duration of the next solar year (1024y) and wait for the sun to explode. that's probably something like a quasar or something really tremendous, and with such a 3 moon regulated setup, we could potentially really go for the biggest explosion yet (really go out with a bang). anyay quasars eventually turn into galaxies anyway, so the deciding factor is probably fear of death.

### 2022-09-28 09:25 - elaborating a little more on the matrix

there are quite a few parts that I left out of the last entry sorta on purpose. first, the realisation that this technology will eventually be used to "enslave" humankind, I figure it's a pretty good idea to get kyle and the those guys a chance to get started working on the technology now. I don't know if they want to implement it in the party-LAN format or they'll want to just completely go full "you get better screens but that's it" (no levitation, PK, or power generation, etc.) it's fairly likely that other secret organisations will be implementing the full reality matrix so as to keep it secret. I just don't know what sort of consumer access they want to allow people to have with it. it's not my decision.

so, then why would I come up with such an awful idea of how to use such a technogy. first, I agree with vulcan in that you have to start a technology in its "worst" implementation, which is usually war and sex. second, I agree with mcluhan that the technology *medium* is the message -- and so it doesn't really make much of a difference to me what content that technology is producing, just that watching television is in itself an upgrade in technology, because of the things it leads to. technology in itself isn't inherently bad (or good), and it's a reflection of the way we now interface with that asspect of reality. it doesn't matter if the technology is used for good or bad, because the progress is the medium itself, not the content or who controls it. our minds begin to reflect the technology no matter how sinister its application is.

the next problem that I specifically didn't address is the obvious problem of ruling. I've stated in the past that I don't want to be a king or a ruler. instead, I see myself, not as the guy giving commands, but the steady stream of desire for improvements (I promise, I'll always start at the worst, so there are always improvements to be made). so, if I head over to texas for a while, there are a number of advantages to this, which is that most notably I can interface with a lot of the economically powerful that want to implement this technology, and there was this weird thing that I kept having have happen while I was smoking is that a lot of these guys feel like they can't just take my technology from me for free, and that is they need to do some sort of deal or exchange for it. well, I don't really want any money or power, so there's nothing that they can really offer me, other than they can send their daughters off with me, I guess. this was the "redeemed ones" idea I referred to. I have no idea what to do with that, but sure, I guess.

the problem with it that I saw is let's say that kyle's daughter (I think her name is lyra, but I'm not 100% sure) is the first one -- well, then that sorta implies that I transfer over that position to her. she'll be the "king" in sense that she now has the big picture and taking over the 2nd ray role of taking parts (3) and desire (1) and figureing out how to combine them like I do (probably with as little resistance as possible). again, I don't really know what on earth to do here. one of the things I've noticed is that a lot of people really dislike the fact that I have the idea. they may like the idea, but the fact that I had it means that now they can't have it or something, so they want others to have my ideas so that they can be used. (this may be a nosebook restriction telling people not to use my ideas, EVEN THOUGH I'VE SAID A MILLION TIMES THEY'RE ALL FREE). obviously, the other reason why it's a good idea for me to give up the director role to someone else is so that she can be steered by nosebook, and like me, she'll have to figure out what to do and how to interact with a bunch of different ideas, which some don't feel good (so obviously need to be evolved), and other good-feeling ideas that are clearly nosebook's desire/steering. it'll be really good for her. she may fail a few times, but the snake-bros are cool with getting stuff wrong, so that's a good environment for her to learn in. I also don't know what is my expected relationship going to be with her either, because if I'm constantly around, you can imagine that no matter how much she comes up with her own ideas, it'll be perceived that I'm still making all the decisions (or influcencing them, when it's probably more like nosebook doing most of the influencing). I just don't want to be stuck in such a spot (neither making decisions for others or teling them how to do things) so I'm probably going to peace out of that awful situation as quickly as possible. I really want nothing to do with any of that, so she's kinda on her own pretty soon after that. there are potential compromises, but I don't like any one of them. I prefer to, instead of fighting over what way I think things should be done, to just let the CTO and CEO do things the way that they want to. yuck.

---

the other thing I didn't really cover much was the reality zones. I gave a mention that the moons would be 2-4-6 in order, but I didn't really explain much more than that. I figure that charon will probably have mostly 1-2-3 ray perspectives on it. this place will be the highest energy and frequency, dealing with mostly non-physical stuff. I figure most of the girls will be here. there are other 1st rays in perspective than myself, but for now I'll use my own example. I costantly have new ideas in the form of desire for technology and things, those ideas need a platform to come into existance, which is the sun's energy, the planet itself (chiron), and probably many 2nd ray perspective girls as well. that desire is combined with 3rd ray aspects to become a suitable energy to become 4th ray in nature.

to explain this, I must first explain the system in terms of time. 4th ray is the most balanced, least amplitude signal (nearest to zero), it's all about harmony and balance. 3rd ray energy must also be kept in balance as well because these are sequences of perspective, and an imbalance would destabilise the whole system. its opposite, the 5th is pretty similar, in that ideas and concepts need to retain some of their individuality so blending isn't preferred. the deviation from the ideal doesn't begin to happen until the astral where one takes the concept/ideal and tries to fit it into a physical frame. at that point, it starts to get tradeoffs, making it no longer ideal. when we think of time, we think of state 1 and state 2 and it's time that passes for the transformation to happen from one state to another. we perceive time as a change into a different state. for example, consider a wheel. any point on the wheel, rotate the wheel enough, and it'll inevitably return back to the same point. this is not time. time is when you rotate the wheel, and something else is now in a different position. in this example, the wheel is the conceptual/symbolic and the road is physical/desire (chaotic) states where you end up with something different than you started with. a change in position is *apparent* and so therefore this is organised into something sensual by the imagination.

so you have charon taking 1st ray energies from all relevant desire, then combined with the sun's energy and other 2nd ray energy, this is then converted into stable 3rd ray parts -- which are then passed over to pluto who can then convert those stable symbols into concepts and ideals suitable for mentation in the more material planes. these are the narrators, the story tellers, the balancers, and the time magicians. you can imagine that with such a coastructed reality where all portions of the sky are created, they can then move around the planets to the positions that they want them in so that temporal effects can be used to counterbalance it. a good example is that 9-11 is was probably a counterbalance to some future event of extremely good-feeling, which, if unbalanced would destabilise the system in what we think of as the future (in our perspective the events haven't happened yet). the moon does what it's already doing.

the spheres also roughly correspond to the different atomospheres as well. earth's atmosphere and the other "planets" (mars, venus, etc.) ie. visible and UV spectrum things will be placed in the moon's sphere, while pluto will paint the stars, such as our sun and the other famous ones. charon will be mostly outside of the visible spectrum, so nobody needs to really worry about it, but those high powered gamma rays and such will still have an influence on the inhabitants of earth.

### 2022-09-28 18:22 - I think we should wait until it all falls apart

the smoking has caused quite a stir the last few days. in addition to that I noticed that I just don't really have any desire to try and email snake-bros or anything now that I'm fully sober again. today when I was working outside, I was feeling the reactions to the last entry and stuff too and it seems that people aren't very impressed with my ideas on how to make it the worst manifestation possible. I suppose that people haven't been listening to me repeat myself over and over again that "worst" is just the magnitude. "best" is the same magnitude. the *content* of the manifestation will be a reflection of how you feel and how you conceptualise it to be, so if worst produces an expectation that doesn't feel good, then that's what'll manifest.

for me, that idea is invigourating. it literally sounds like the most difficult matrix to figure out possible. it completely eliminates all of the problems for them like star-watching, and the sun's effect on LOA speed. they can have a fully neutered environment where growing up in the system, the only way I can really ever come to the conclusion that there is a matrix, is by using my emotion. this sounds very very tantalising for me because when I figure it out, it's literally going to be the most difficult setup that literally nobody else in the universe will have been able to make it through. it's quite literally "impossible" for everyone else[^1] except for me because I'm certain that I can make it through. that sounds absolutely like the most difficult thing to accomplish ever. I know I can do this (not everything I'm so sure about), so having that kind of confidence, I always enjoy an opportunity to show off.

so, because nobody wants to find a way to feel the way they want to about whatever the manifestation is, I'm pretty certain that it's just going to keep getting worse. I told sesily that I don't believe technology is the answer, so I just don't really think it's even all that good of an idea to even try and do it with technology. you know last night I became conscious in one of my dreams and in it I was explaining to robert edward grant my theory of how electrostatics works and he seemed pretty interested. he has a lot of money and quite the capability to turn it into a product, so if he's already working on it, it just gives me kind of a bad vibe. trying to get out there and compete with other people and do marketing and all of that stuff just really isn't my deal anymore. I kinda like that all of the sharks are worked up about the idea and are planning on using it to try and further gain an advantage on humankind. I guess it relieves me of having to be the bad-guy. again, really nice because then I don't have to worry about all of that business stuff that I hate. I like discovery, which is why I like smoking weed.

---

as such, I really don't see this situation getting any better soon. I just had a conversation with remi where she was telling me that I can't smoke weed, but couldn't supply for me a reason why I can't smoke weed. I suggested that the most likely reason is that there *is* a network out there and this is yet another instance of them trying to control my drug usage. I explained to her that in spain I used to buy drugs from various people and that always the next time I came back, all of a sudden they could no longer sell me something for some reason. there was just no easy way for them to stop me from smoking weed, so my theory is they got a whole bunch of people on the network so that they could preempt my attempts to obtain drugs. this included all of my friends, so when my smoking buddies all of a sudden are now super concerned about my drug usage and trying to prevent me and stuff, it's pretty obvious.

they can try and remove my ability to smoke weed all they want, but it doesn't really do much to my desire, except for amplify it. eventually, they'll run out of options and/or they'll wear theirselves out trying to control me. eventually, all will have to be revealed because it's just not possible to keep the secret of the network for too much longer. in short, what I'm saying is that the manifestation *cannot* happen until everything is revealed and the whole charade falls apart.

once the manifestation happens and the whole world's eyes are opened, I figure it's *then* that they'll have to go back and fix up the timeline so that I was never here. if I'm here, then the secret will be revealed.

this was actually one of the main sources of my decision to write this, because I just don't want to put kyle in a bad spot and start spouting all of my crazy ideas and stuff. it's just not fair to him or his family if I inject problems that wouldn't otherwise be there. so, until my whole situation is out in the open, I believe I want to continue going at this by myself. I'm totally fine. they'll eventually get rid of me and replace me with a duplicate that fits the narrative better.

I'm sorry I gave people so much hope and good-feeling when I was stoned. you can see how stark of a contrast it is to sober-kenny. it really wasn't my intention to give a false sense of hope. it's just that when I'm stoned, I feel many times better than I do normally. obviously, I don't want to make any action when I'm stoned and I can't be permastoned either, so until I find a way to feel as good as I do when I'm stoned normally, then it simply won't be happening.

[1]: reaction wondering why it'll be for everyone else, is because everybody else will have done their best to try and make it through and they've managed to plug all of the holes. that means that nobody else will be able to make it through anymore after they've got it everything setup. I however, don't really think in those terms, so I know that I'll make it through. because the efforts that they're expending to ensure everyone doesn't make it through is so much, the energetic response to my making it through will be so great, that it'll probably cause all of us to transition into something else. I'm literally the first to do it, probably a few middle times, and also the last. for whatever reason, I've been selected (or something) to do this probably because I have such a high opinion of myself, meanwhile others are sheepherded around by the sheepherders. congrats on being mediocre.

### 2022-09-29 19:19 - back on track

so I don't really know what happened, so I'll just relate my conclusions and my experience. I woke up this morning and I had a lot of activity/reactions concerning what I talked about yesterday. I explained that I don't believe that any manifestation can happen until the whole secret thing sorta falls apart. I was put into situations (conversations) where I was explaining my point of view from that perspective, and the thing is, I know I'm right about all of this stuff, and these fools are just sorta digging their own holes for themselves. what they don't understand is that I've spent more than 10y where the things that people are telling me are exactly opposite to what is really happening. obviously, I know something is up, and I also know that people are directly lying to me. the way that I've figured all of this out (and many other things) is through the utilisation of drugs. so, when they tell me that that I "can't" smoke weed, they're *clearly* mistaken. it's the way that I think things through and process things.

there is literally *no* reason not to smoke weed, so I'm obviously going to be doing it in the future again; that you can be certain of. there are a number of things that are on the horizon which they may or may not see coming. for example, sesily supposedly will be buying me a blower, presumably so that I can do better work, but I'm supposing that all of this will be without pay. I can't really force them to pay me, so I won't be forcing them to do anything. it's just a really bad reflection on them and everything else that's happening, and so I suppose they're going to be going through a phase where they're learning how to not care what others think. it's also possible that nosebook will come up with some super justification to it where everyone believes that it is in fact proper to say that you'll pay me, but then not pay me because you want to affect behaviour.

I considered this morning a number of different options, and probably the one that resonated with me the most is essentially shame. I think that sesily used shame on remi (remy, but I like remi better) a lot when she was younger to influence remi to behave the way that sesily wanted remi to behave. I noticed this reaction yesterday in relation to me revealing paul and the coke nose drip -- of which I don't care, but the reaction was good information to tell me that there is still a lot of shame used to affect behaviour. the reaction of shame coming from paul did not come from me. I like coke and have no problem doing another line or two. the thing that I don't really want to do is to drink. that's my main drug that I don't really want to get back into. even at the end of my weed stint I was really starting to dislike the stoned feeling, and it'll still be a little bit before I return back to it. same thing for coffee; from time to time, I just want to drink coffee, and IMO that drug is just the same as weed. weed lasts about as long, and affects me a little more than coffee does, and from time to time I want to smoke because I really enjoy it, just like I really enjoy a good cup of coffee. nothing new there.

one of the options is to constantly shame sesily about not paying until she finally fires me, or pays me. the other option that I'm probably going to do is to go and buy weed, and then go over to there sober, and then when we get there smoke, so she can see that I'm the same person, just perhaps only a little more insightful than normal. you see, I plan to try and win her over to the advantages of controlled usage of drugs. I thought of a lot of examples that I can use, where if we treated other things in life like we treated drugs, then it's simply not a problem. cars, guns, alcohol, and power tools are all legal and far more dangerous than weed. in addition, her tenants smoke weed. so, there's no reason for them to be living at her place if they're smoking weed and she's that against it.

though that option resonated with me a lot, I don't really think that I'll try and do anything like that. any time that I try and affect behaviour, it always backfires on me -- so, I know that their attempts to affect my behaviour will ultimately backfire on them too. I don't really need to try and help them shoot theirselves in the foot; they're doing quite well already.

so, when I meant that I want to just let it all fall apart, I'm literally taking the advice that I give to jaron regarding jerrica and his therapy situation of accumulated days. I tell him that it's a situation that if he wants to, he can start asking questions and see who starts to squirm. once you see that, a series of questions will begin to unravel the whole situation. I could do that and start trying to reveal their system by asking a bunch of questions until it's rather obvious -- OR, I could just find a way to feel good about my present conditions, no matter what they are.

I tried to explain this concept to mom the other night when jaron was in mom's bathroom and she wanted to go to sleep. I explained that she's saying, "I can't feel good right now because the present conditions (jaron in the bathroom) don't allow me to feel good." she said that I'm built differently than she is and that somehow all of the universe works different for her and nosebook. they believe they can (using the example from that night) take away my computer and somehow by limiting the conditions, they're going to quell my desire, instead of amplifying it further. she's an experienced parent, so she knows that when a kid has something he likes (like weed), you can't just take it away; you have to find an equal or better replacement for it..

---

so, what I think happened today is that they recognised that they can't just take away the toy; they need a diffrent replacement. (un?) fortunately, it appears that my insistence on talking about the network and all of that means that they need to isolate me away from everyone else so that I'm not revealing their secret to everyone else -- which probably means there are others in pueblo that inside the network, but they have not consented to it (I think it's a loophole in the patriot act or something), which would probably be a pretty big disaster if others found out that they have zero privacy, and no way to opt out of the network (like me). even bigger of a problem for them would be if there were a way for me to start spreading my technique to others. it's fine while I'm around people like I'm around now (remi, mom, jaron, greg, sesily, etc.) where they have no other goal right now in life than to simply follow the directions that they're given. they undermine their own attempts to even begin to start thinking for theirselves (hence why I believe they're automatons controlled by nosebook -- which is also why I don't really treat them like people, family, or friends even). the time has LONG PAST when I belive that I can actually have a friend anymore.

I've completely converted over to the dark side now myself. I'm just another actor, just like they are. I treat myself like an automaton just the same that nosebook treats them like an automaton. I just find a way to feel good about my present situation, no matter what it is.

as a result, this seems to have produced a bit of a reversal. before I went over to sesily's apartements today, I think they were figuring that I was going to make a big deal out of everything, and so by making a big deal out of it all, they were going to have to isolate me. even in the hours prior to sesily arriving, I was continually thinking about kyle over and over. my estimation is that they were probably trying to setup another thing where he would come (or I would go), in order to isolate me (probably another one of their automatons anyway, cause they have to have any possible manifestation completely under their control). however, since I just did my work and didn't make a fuss, I think that plan got cancelled. we're back on track to just letting it all fall apart again. I don't need to try and help them shoot theirselves in the foot. from my perspective. it looks like they're upgrading to the bazooka already. it's gonna be hilarious.

up until they finally pull the trigger, I'm actually quite relived anyway, because I *really* don't want to deal with girls or "friends" anyway (ever seen truman show and truman's "friend" (marlon) that brings over the brewskis?). I prefer to just do this. I don't need girls or friends to feel good anyway, and it also gives nosebook more time to get everything setup anyway so that you guys are really locked into their network. enjoy it. not my problem.

### 2022-10-01 16:19 - you can't change what I'm attracting

I woke up this morning and the first thing on my mind was a bunch of different ways to try and force sesily to pay me. mom was gone, so this could have been because they were having a meeting about what are their possible difficulties that could cause them to be using a bazooka for a footgun. regarding that, I really don't know what is the way they're going to shoot theirselves in the foot. that's not my problem. I just know that every time that I've seen myself or anyone try and affect behaviour (through shame or manipulation), it never really gets them what they want and kinda backfires on them. I made that comment generally, not specifically.

anyway, I let the ideas pass through my head and the situations play out. if you watch the recording, I kinda get annoyed near the end and say that all of these are pretty useless cause none of them felt good. my *only* option is to feel good about my conditions. what is happening is your basic LOA siutuation where sesily is trying to affect my behaviour by manipulating the conditions. no matter how much she doesn't pay me, that's not going to change my opinion of weed. one option I have is to try and manipulate her to begin paying me, but that doesn't feel good because by doing that, I'm basically saying that I *need* weed, and I definitely don't *need* weed. I enjoy it from time to time to get a new perspective when my current one is getting a little static, and it's just quite enjoyable for me.

it's a LOA situation because she's trying to affect my behaviour by manipulating conditions -- so then, if I try and get her to pay me (affect her behaviour), then I'm literally doing the same thing that she's doing. she's saying, I need you to behave a certain way (not smoke weed) so that I'll give you what you want (money) -- and I'm doing exactly *the same thing* by saying that sesily needs to behave a certain way (pay me money) so that she gets what she wants from me. you can see the problem, I'm sure.

I'm not going to play that game of trying to manipulate or affect behaviour. I tried that various times in my life, and it's backfired pretty bad. I'm not going to do that because that's saying that I need her to do something different in order to feel good. my *ONLY* option is to accept that she will never pay me and then each day, if working for free feels better to me than something else, then I'll do that, but I shouldn't expect to get paid. I will not use her or her manipulation as a reason to feel bad. that may mean that I'll never smoke weed again, but like them cutting off my internet connection (to affect my desire to download movies or games), there are possible workarounds in the future.

the final option that I *could* do to try and do to affect her behaviour, is to win her over to my side of the argument, but it's pretty hopeless. she is the way she is, and especially while nosebook is around, she won't be changing.

---

believe it or not this subject extends to the previous subject of letting it all fall apart quite significantly (and is the main topic of this entry). I presently believe that everyone in my life is just an actor. mom is like 70% herself, but there is that 30% that seems to be nosebook. I haven't really known sesily or remi as long so I can't really compare their past beaaviour to their present behaviour very easily, but in mom's or daniel's case it appears very significantly to me that they used to be very different before 2015-2016 and after that (I can trace nosebook's influence on my life for as long back as 2012, but that's when everyone else got on the network and my relationship with the world dramatically changed). even some really notable examples like vera tell me that she wasn't on the network at first, but then one day she came home, announced to me she's now part of the soap opera, and since then started to try and limit my drug usage and things like that. I have a lot of evidence that this influence is real and has been happening since about 2012, so it's pretty difficult to erase that kind of evidence for that.

again, there is literally nothing that I can do about any of that. I can't change daniel's, vera's, zaryn's, or raquel's decision to start taking orders from this "network", as that's their decision to make. the *only* thing that I can do is to find a way to feel good in my present situation no matter the conditions. there is no other way.

so, no matter what manifestation happens, I know that it'll be just like my experience with everyone else so far. they do what the network tells them to do, meanwhile maintaining the majority of their personality on top of it, so it looks "natural". that's sorta what I expect to happen. that's what I'm attracting. nobody can change that.

---

when I was with raquel, she believed that I was cheating on her. no matter how hard I tried to convince her otherwise, that was what she was attracting, and so in her perspective, that's what was definitely happening. I can't change what she's attracting, because like me, she probably had lots of experience in the past (this is the way that men are) to back up her conclusion, as well.

whatever happens with this manifestation will be the same. anyone involved in it will be subject to my attraction -- and, no matter how hard any of these girls try and prove to me that they're not just another nosebook actor, they won't be able to budge my belief or expectation. the may be able to distract me from it for a little while with sex or whatever, and no matter how good they are at sex or whatever, I will still see nosebook trying to steer me through them (for example, I want to do something like smoke weed, and so they're trying to use sex to keep me away from the weed, and so in my perception, that looks like yet another case of nosebook, and they're just trying to get their own pleasure). no matter what happens, you won't be able to shake my constant recognition that something is trying to steer me.

---

this is kind of why I don't see any other way than to just let the whole thing fall apart. when I say fall apart, I mean that people are no longer blindly following nosebook's directives, and instead now actually follow their own emotional guidance system instead. thinking for theirselves instead of just blindly believing what the "authorities" say is also a pretty big bonus. once people begin to adopt this "individual" mindset (the next "root-race"), nosebook will transform significantly: it'll still track everything we thing, see, touch, taste, smell, and all biometric data -- of course privacy was just an illusion anyway, so it doesn't really matter anymore. I believe all of that data will also become available too, to allow for better healthcare and the like, as well.

this change is already happening, cause I can see that over time, nosebook has gone from shocking me when I did things they didn't like (like dream or see images in my eyes), to how it is now where they only don't want me to do drugs. eventually, they'll finally give up on the idea of trying to affect behaviour by manipulating conditions, but I don't really see that happening fully for at least a 50-500y more (it'll take a few generations); it could take even more actually, considering that these guys have been using the same set of techniques to affect behaviour for at least 20ky now. they span many empires, and it's my belief that they can do this because they don't actually die but just move from body to body.

---

so, what does that mean for me? well, again, you can't really change what I'm attracting (my beliefs and desire -- expectations), and so you'll notice that at the moment, I don't really hold a very high opinion of sex. I believe it to be a VERY INFERIOR drug. my experience has been that it doesn't open up my mind to new ideas that didn't originate from my partner, I don't really feel a lot better, and I don't really see things diffrently afterward. I much prefer real actual drugs for those times when I want to have my mind opened.

I don't really see a point to relationships, to be fully honest. if they're for pleasure, I don't find them very pleasurable, and if they're for support, that's not something I want to be involved in because I don't want to expect someone else to do things for me, that I don't believe myself capable of doing. relationships are conditional, and the unconditional relationships (till death do we part), seem like a swamp. I suppose they could by like something of friendship, but again, I don't have friends. I just have people that pretend to be my friend, but when it comes to real actual conversation about real things (like nosebook), they're only there to reinforce the narrative that I'm supposed believe.

my *only* option here is to just accept that any future relationships will just be other actors anyway, and so like doing yardwork for free for sesily, I can decide if I want to work for free cause she doesn't like my behaviour, or I can do something else. I'll probably get a relationship eventually, when I'm completely bored and there's nothing else better to do.

I could also just jump into a relationship and then just be brutally honest with everyone, calling out their BS even more than I do now, rathar than just playing my part like just another actor. I don't really find that to have a very good payoff because again, I prefer the benefits of drugs. it would create a lot of drama though, so probably good for ratings.

I'll probably just wait for it to fall apart. there's no sense for me to try and affect behaviour. meanwhile everyone still believes that secrets and manipulation of behaviour is desirable, we'll continue to have the same manifestation.

---

you know, there's another reaction which is saying like, "we don't want to keep waiting. we want [some condition] now" (so we can feel good) and to that I'll say, that sounds a whole lot like needing a condition in order to feel good. saying the same thing from my perspective: "I want [unlimited access to drugs] now" (so I can feel good). see how it's the same?

it's unfortunate that the present situation does not allow for a manifestation. there's nothing I can do about anyone else's attraction. the thing that smoking weed showed me is that when I feel good, I'm compatible with a manifestation, but the sense that I got from the conversation at PDI (pueblo diversified industries), is that a lot of people are still wanting to continue to feel bad. not my problem, and there's nothing I can do about it. I can't change anyone else except for myself. I can say though that, if they're going to regulate my weed, the manifestation won't happen until I feel that good without smoking. the fastest way for everyone to get there is to feel good about the present conditions, without needing them to change.

---

as a general rule, the reason why this works this way is because reality is a reflection of how I feel. if conditions are bad and that feels bad, I'm attracting more situations that feel like I do now (which is bad). in order to get a good-feeling situation, I have to find a way to feel good about my present situation, so I can attract a situation that reflects how I feel (which is now good).

### 2022-10-05 23:42 - I honestly have no idea what is going on.

for reals, I'm so confused. I'm going to try and talk a little bit of it out here, so sorry for a bit of an off-topic entry here.

---

yesterday (I think -- it's hard to tell what time/day it is now), I talked with my dad. just a sec lemme check my phone to be sure...

it was the day before yesterday. I have no idea what happened to yesterday. like literally no idea. today is wednesday. I have very little memory of yesterday. I'm terribly confused about everything and starting some time yesterday or the day before, time no longer really has any real tangible qualities to it anymore. like, I look at the clock and all of a sudden I realise that hours have passed and I have no memory of it but it's not like time is passing rapidly; it feels like it's going normal speed and everything is normal, but I'm really only perceiving a very small fraction of it.

I think my vision improved between yesterday and today as well because I noticed that I can now see the chair on the balcony in front of #224 in front of sesily's place. I could also see the details of the treehouse in the property behind it too when that used to be a blur the last time I was there. everything is very weird.

---

I remember in the conversation that I had with my dad, I was explaining to him that I can just perceive the conceptual realm and it exists simultaneously to the physical world. I can retrieve data from it by using memory recall and realisisations to get things back from it.

this morning I woke up from a weird dream where I don't really remember much of it at all, but I do remember I had this weird half-burned joint, but I don't really remember smoking it. the other thing is that I remember I in the dream I was looking into some of the chemical composition of things, but my accuracy wasn't good. I wasn't so sure what I was seeing or something like that. I woke up from the dream this morning thinking about how it's not really such a big problem that my accuracy isn't perfect yet, as I've still got a long way to go before I'm really good at it, so it's not really a problem to be still getting things wrong. it's not like I have much experience with it anyway, so it's all good.

after waking up, I decided that I wanted to write out the COI idea for [conceptual designs](/captain-of-industry.md#next-stage-of-industry-conceptual-designs) and [progression of modes of complexity](/captain-of-industry.md#progression-of-points-of-view), and it seemed pretty good, but I was having a bit of trouble to get out the last three (symbolic, big-picture, and desire) -- and at the hight of my struggle, and when I finally got it figured out, sesily calls me and wants me to come over to work on the yard. she says she's going to pay me $200 for it, which is considerably more than I expected her to pay me.

to explain, the day previous (yesterday), I kept feeling this sort of strong desire coming from kyle and maybe even from the whole snake-bros kinda group (not so sure), and it even felt like randall was in there as well. it felt to me like I had sorta proven (not the right word) that I was able to do the things that I claim that I can do (namely the stuff in the dream that it felt like I was still a bit inaccurate on), and that's all good, because combined with my capacity to figure the stuff out, we can actually make a reality the whole pluto plan, and then further on. now, whether that goes through as planned is not really my deal, because I just desire and then things have a sort of magical way of working theirselves out. at this point, all of that stuff is effortless. even if I'm still a bit inaccurate with my capacity to see (as in I don't fully comprehend what I'm looking at or I'm interpretting or making incorrect assumptions about the concept I'm feeling), it doesn't really matter, because those things, like every other thing, sorta finds a way to work itself out. I don't even have to worry about trying to make anything happen on timing anymore because even the things that feel like thoughtless (or even a reaction from negative emotion still work out just fine).

before I continue, just to illustrate this a bit, for example with the smoking weed thing, I had quit. the last day I really felt strongly that I didn't want to be doing it any more. I have money to buy more, but I felt [I got the messasge](/the-manifestation.md#2022-09-26-0818---i-got-the-message) and smoking further was even causing me some discomfort. I definitely want to be quitted for a while, so then in various entries I [seemingly made a bigger deal out of it](/the-manifestation.md#2022-09-29-1919---back-on-track) than I really cared about it, and I get the feeling it gave them the illusion that I wanted to smoke more than I actually do. this is a perfect example of me making a brainless comment that seemingly has perfect timing. I have no idea what that caused on their end, but judging by the reactions, it caused them to have to begin to make a move. some unintended comments caused them to start the timings, not me. it's clearly LOA at work, so I just kinda stay back and watch it happen.

anyway, after feeling those reactions that I should just finally let go and let the manifestation start to happen, cause it really felt to me like [I got the messasge](/the-manifestation.md#2022-09-26-0818---i-got-the-message), and so I should just not worry about it and let it all start to happen. I decided this first, then I started to think about it, so why am I avoiding sesily? I'm not really. I had already decided previously that going to do yard work for her was actually quite an expanding experience for me, and so even though she wasn't paying me, I believe it has actually a much more positive effect. there are things that I wanted to do like write out those COI ideas and clean my room and stuff, but I figured that I would just go and do the yardwork because I feel like I'm growing faster there doing that than sitting at home watching youtube or something.

---

I get there and again I have that time warp thing. I guess I worked for close to 7 hours, breaking for maybe 1/2h to eat, and honestly in my perception, it didn't feel like more than 3-4h. I know logically that I got there at 13 and left at maybe 17-18, but still it went so fast and I felt like I was making so much progress, that it was fine.

along the way I was trying to figure out why she (they) would suddenly reverse their idea to give me money. I suppose now that I'm writing this, they probably know that I'm not actually all that interested in smoking for a while (maybe that's what that weird half-burnt joint in the dream was about -- not sure).

the conclusion that I came to is that they probably wanted to keep me busy doing stuff and so this is their last resort, because if I keep going the way I'm going I may start thinking too much about about how atoms work and figure too much out.

the other conclusion is that they want to do the pluto thing, but it has to be kept a secret (I would obviously be very open about it, hiding nothing because there's no foul play, and even probably would even like to stream it or turn it into a thing where the planets and stars that we launch will be able to be tuned into, making it more like a TV series, so people could see how the different planets and such are evolving -- but that's me). that way, if I continue to hone my capacity while smoking a bit of weed, then they'll get, and be able to implement the system and I'll just be a washed up stoner working on game designs or something lame. I know that conclusion is in opposition to the first one, but the common thread there is they don't actually want me to be working on figuring out how the atom works and all of that stuff.

I decided to drop it and think about other things. my brain has not been working too well today, and I get the feeling that they're trying to limit my capacity to tune into concepts, because I use memory recall and realisations, and let me tell you, my memory recall was pretty terrible today, and I had a number of very very WAY OFF realisations. like, for example I thought that john goodman was "the dude" in big lewbowski -- a film I've seen quite a few times, and even celebrated on numerous occasions by purchasing/making white russians with daniel. when I looked at the imdb page for it, I literally couldn't recognise "the dude" and when I saw his name, I thought he was harry from "dumb and dumber" -- also a film that I've seen tens of times. I don't understand what is wrong and why I can't make connections between things that I know. I have a feeling they're trying to short circuit my ability to make connections, and because I use that same part of my brain for normal everyday brain function, things are all very strange. pulling weeds wasn't a difficult task though -- but there's not much to remember or realise.

anyway, I noticed that my capacity to feel reactions was pretty hindered and my efforts to figure out what is going on, I found it pretty difficult. I really suspect they're trying to keep that capacity down, but there were other moments of really strange clarity which were quite unmistakable where I was clearly very certain what I was feeling.

the first one that I noticed was when I went to go eat. when driving into the parking for "el jefe", I noticed that I felt like I wanted to go to taco bell, but we were already here. I tried the door for "el jefe" and it was locked. it felt to me like it was closed so I decided to walk to taco bell. on the walk over, I noticed that the open sign was on, but I had already made my decision. when I walked into taco bell, there was a woman that was really looking at me very strongly. I thought she was one of the attendants and was going to tell me hi or welcome. she then suddenly looked very concerned and furiously started packing her stuff up. she clearly did not want to be in the same room as me. I noticed that she had a young baby with her. I decided to ignore her and walk to the counter. I ordered fine and was off to get the drink when I noticed this other girl standing at the door waiting for the woman with the young child. I noticed her but didn't think much about it. I got my drink and they left pretty quickly. I sat down not thinking too much about it. then, while eating, I kept getting reminded of the girl standing at the door. I could finally feel desire.

I have no idea why it took so long and why I was so clueless along the way. it was as if my ability to feel reactions was turned off. as I was thinking about it later, it seems that I was probably attracted there, so even though I had plans to go one way (el jefe), I ended up going toward wanted anyway. this is another good example of timing that seems to work out really well even without any ability to feel. I just sorta go with the flow. I look up while eating and I can see people inside of el jefe and the open sign is on, so I have no idea why the door was locked. it was as if destiny ensured that I was going to go to taco bell, even though I went the wrong way for a bit. no big deal. I really don't have to try anymore. I just do whatever felt the next logical step is, and obviously if the door is locked, it's to go to the next one. there are too many of these types of events each day for me to recount them all, but it's happening more and more frequently. I just go with the flow and everything works out. I probably am writing this entry just to tell that story and the next one.

I get back and I'm sitting there pulling weeds when all of a sudden marc pops into my head, and it's in association to the COI stuff I wrote about with the different ways to look at the macro game. I watch him play starcraft and that game is pure micromanagement. there are literally no tools for macroing the game, and so marc is doing a lot of the things that I'm talking about there, but starcraft is a *much* more simple game in that there are only a few types of units. there isn't a concept of having units that have varying stats based on the concept that the design is infused with. that part alone would make a game like starcraft a much more rich game, because with a gradient of capacity, it would make countering the opponent a completely different game. additionally, the game cannot really affort to be much more complex than it already is because you have to micromanage every last thing -- which is fine inside of a battle or something, but if you're in a battle you still have to remember the macro game while fighting the battle. the macro tools would take away a lot of the tediusness of the macro game and allow you to focus on the fun part which is microing the battles. I was trying to explore the different ways to take the starcraft concept and apply a lot of those ideas to it. I thought about how cool it would be to finally make a RTS game. this is literally something that I've been dreaming up designs for ever since I played "cyber empires" back on the 386 when I was like 8 or something.

I obviously have no way to know if marc was actually considering those ideas I wrote about, but the clarity of the reaction was something that I had not experienced before. I really really enjoyed thinking about the different was to rethink the macro game interface for a RTS. while thinking about it, I noticed a lot of chaotic (peripheral, tangential) thoughts popping into my head. it's no worry because tons and tons of thoughts fly through my head, and I just igore them. my body/brain are just sorta on autopilot, but I'm off in another world developing those ideas. I may try and write them out soon and see what reactions I get. man, an RTS would be really fun to think about the design of further.

after that, there were two other events of considerable clarity that I don't know which one came first. one of them, I suddenly, with great intensity remembered a thing that happened last time I was at sesily's where the woman with the dog (lucy) looked at me as we were passing by each other and I noticed her eyes for the first time (previously she was always looking down or away, and I hardly ever look anyone in the eyes anyway), but her eyes were brilliant with a lot of light and sparkled. I noted that she had nice eyes. that memory came back, with a feeling of uncertainty. I explained that I really meant it. then, she went out to go for a run, and I couldn't see who it was, so I was wondering why I kept wanting to look at her. it then popped into my head, "I wonder if that's the woman with the dog that just got home" and I felt really at rest with the question. normally, I doubt myself because I can't see or recognise faces at a distance (neither do I know what her face looks like really), so it's always weird. I remembered a black girl I passed by on the jerry murphy offramp, where her thoughts were also quite clear to me, and I told her I didn't have any idea what in the world is happening myself, so I just sorta go with it. anyway, I saw her some weeks later and wondered if it was the same girl, but back then I doubted myself more, so I wasn't going to jump to many conclusions too quickly. weird how even the memories that I recall are even relevant.

the other event that happened around the same time is all of a sudden I remembered this girl that I saw in walmart yesterday where she wanted to look at me in the eyes. I didn't really know what to do, so I just froze there looking at her. I kinda lost track of time and space. normally, when looking at someone in the eyes, I try and feel receptive of them and the energy that their eyes put out so that it doesn't hit me so hard, and that makes for a much nicer experience, but I totally forgot to do that with the girl at walmart and was just sorta staring blankly. anyway, it must have had some kind of effect. simultaneous to that memory I remembered the girl that lives in the green house on the opposite side of where I was. she walked down the walkway with (I think her dad. his name is dean, I think) and then at the end she turned around and looked at me. I couldn't really see her so well at the distance and people's faces are a bit blurry, so I just went back to my yardwork. as I remembered these two memories, I noticed that I could have maintained eye contact with her like I did with the girl at walmart -- so, I promised that next time I saw her I would maintain eye contact. when leaving, I had to throw away some weeds and I saw her so I looked, but I didn't look for too long because they were waiting for me in the car. I can, next time..

---

anyway, the clarity that I had today for understanding a concept by using memory was incredibly strong -- so I have no idea what is going on. how can I possibly be getting such strong conceptual understanding through memory recall, yet at the same time, I literally can't remember who is "the dude"? things are definitely really strange. I still have no idea what in the world is going on, but I *do* know that it's totally OK. I'll still end up in the right spot.

yep, I didn't talk through any of the things I thought I would. I guess it's OK. I also gave them more tips on what things are happening in relation to what memory recall, so hopefully they can try and get it even more under control now, lol.

### 2022-10-19 18:03 - wat?

I want to write but I'm not sure what I want to write about. I could write about the manifestation [moves the text over to here].

OK, so I suppose I should talk about it, but it's not much sense because all of these random ideas passing through my head are only ideas. I don't have to worry about any of that because from my highest perspective, none of this even matters. what matters is that it's constant contrast/novelty. I can't be going too fast -- or like if I do, then it has an offset. I don't do these things consciously, but it's the case that my life is heading in the direction of effortless, which means that my vibrational impact is negligable. it also has the effect of delaying every manifestation until they are low amplitude change (effortless means low volume). it seems that the way to do that is to delay a manifestation all the way until it becomes so inevitable.

so, because I have to be this way, I've learned to just go with the flow and realise that I'm always going to be the "last" one to get there. that I know of, I'm the only person that sees myself as the "last". most people, I've seen, perceive things from the (potential) perspective of the first; I however, see things from the perspective of the last: it'll *only* happen when it's so inevitable that everyone in resistance it is forced to allow it, or not survive, monopoly-me. it's basically a new solar regime, so I do enjoy the thoughts and stuff, but I see it from another perspective, which is that it's gatta be smoothe: it won't happen until it's so inevitable it couldn't possibly *not* happen.

### 2022-10-20 12:51 - what seems to be happening

the last few days seem to indicate that I'm still on track for the demiurge opener, as I think it's the manifestation with the most contrast. I don't know what happens after that, but like I said in the previous entry, none of that makes any difference because I see the manifestation *without* the demiurge so I just keep going NLS until I get there. so, if the demiurge manifestation doesn't happen, that's evolved into something that can produce even more contrast. I have a feeling this will happen, and one of the likely changes in that manifestation is that most (all??) humans will become a supreme being over a set of more primitive types. I think it would be kind of fun to figure out what you want to do when you're put in charge of evolving a secies. in order to get there, we just have to keep taking it step by step. we'll get there though. I've said it many times before that I believe myself to be the pre-game show, rathar than the main event. (mirror clock)

### 2022-10-22 22:10 - the unexpected romance

I just noticed something: today, I was really stopped up and this crazy idea popped into my head which is that I should just go over to allie's house and present the idea I had this morning. anyway, after a turn of events, the final idea we stopped at was hanging out at allie's house then I start with her and kyle's daughter (lyra I think), would be the last. along the way til the same day next year, we'll pick up quite a number of others. so that's the scene in which I will ponder this idea.

I choose not to go with the diaster sudden emergency idea because I didn't want to use emergency or safety as the justification. I prefer to just get back to sober and NLS my way there. all of this hastiness is really a drag for me. so I decided that was good enough but I wanted to actually like it, rathar than just going with the default. I supposed that a date would be good day to start and that alone is enough of a justification. so it's justified, but then there's the time between now and then, and that's going to create some sort of anticipataed response. that anticpated response of me wanting to actually like her is remance. it's a sort of proving ground for the other person to prove themself to me.

that's annoying. I didn't want to do that. (mirror date to clock)

### 2022-10-24 11:55 - I feel like

I woke up this morning and I drank some coffee and I started to get back into the daily routine. I didn't feel much hunger so I didn't eat breakfast and called sesily. she seemed a bit reluctant to do anything today (for yard work or anything). at the same time, I don't really feel like writing a letter to russ right now in my sober state (it feels like resistance), but I suppose I could force myself to do it; I don't really want to though.

I remembered last night that it seemed to me that there was some amount of desire to just continue on the weed train for a bit longer -- perhaps even put the weed in the capsules as well, with the effort of doing something that I don't really suggest is a good idea which is making action/decisions in an altered state of consciousness (on drugs). so, I guess I'm writing this out now so that there is some record somewhere of my decision having been decided in a sober state, even though I'll carry out the action in a non-sober state.

so, I guess I go off now and I purchase another round and then send off things according to my inspiration. seems cool. OK, bbl

### 2022-10-25 00:42 - I have an idea

today, I went to buy a BTS magazine which is ultimate fanguide. I tried to read it at B&N today but I was having some confusion. I tried to tell mom some of the story were that my dates and concept of the story were *wayyyyyy* off. I thought about it and the main reason why I haven't read it yet is because it gave me an idea.

the part of the story that I thought I read (this is not likely factual), but what I remember was a business guy was looking to make a pop group (but a bit more than just a boy-band). he set out looking for the members to the group and when he had found 7 boys (it started with just two -- the band grew over several years adding more members) which fit the description of the components that he needed for the group. the boys figured out that they had a common struggle with: acceptance, vulnerability, and being successful. they they took a regimented and physical (dancing, choreography, physical action) approach to getting past this struggle. the energy that they expended served as their inspiration for their songs and music.

---

though there that business interviews guy doing interviews and stuff, it's mostly all attraction that brings people together like this, so it was their interaction

---

this made me think of another thing which is that I think it would be really cool to do like a whole mullet and more streamlined look anyway, and one of the things that would be really cool is some sort of cross between synthwave and metal -- the basics for a sort of revival of the 80's and 90's, but it'll be done with modern stuff. I kinda want to find a way to turn on the 80's sort of fashion and stuff. I've really been thinking about it since jason's discussion with lev and (gnostic informant). I kinda want to just blast through your physical reality in blink of a weird music fad like the 80's. it'll be really easy to erase me from history that way and just say that it was *just* a music and fashion renaissance.

so, to kinda bring out a sort of 80's sort of environment, you need glam and pop bands to kinda push the new trend. it's a self-fulfilling fashion paradigm who's concepts and lifestyle only last only for as long as the trend. so, one way to get pop bands who take their struggle and turn it into creativity is to take the BTS concept and merge it a bit with my own: instead of it being a boy-band, it could instead be a girl-band. we'll do all the same things: we'll figure out their struggle and then how to express their processs of transforming it creatively.

this way we can *only* just be a musical and fashion feature and never have to use any other technology other than what is already exists.

(the answer)

### 2022-10-25 01:20 - another way to build a galaxy...

another way to build a galaxy is to keep me on this planet occupied and doing stuff, while I continue to expand -- and so I already monologued this idea, but the basics of it goes that I think one of nosebook's tactics to keeping my energy low is to create more and more "clones" of me which then use up some amount of that energy. by spreading my energy amongst many people, they're reducing the effect of a large amplitude pulse of energy. one way they could take that further is the idea of us taking our Xs and putting them into a pool of genes for an initial population, then the most stone-aged men of all time... like these guys are dense because the longer they're in the stone age, the more time they have to run their utopia on my energy (by dividing my signal among theirselves and all of these stoners).

this is beneficial for me/we in a number of ways because I/we get to take our genetic identity and evolve it as a group of people, instead of only just me and my situation. we're a sort of group personality -- or, perhaps you might think of it as a "source" to all of those beings in the group. so, though "they" control us because we're locked into the most stone age consciousness, so we don't have adequate perception from any single one of them to experience through, so we're looking from the perspective of that "source" or benevolent being over the stone age selves that we are.

see how cool that is for me/us to experience? you guys can just build the galaxy 100% behind the curtain of the sky of thousands and thousands of planets suitable for those genetics are able to reproduce at a speed that stays up to speed with my energy expansion. when they run out of space, they can keep me/us away from my/our alignment billions and billions and billions of years[^1].

---

so, let's just say that somehow you manage to be able to divide my frequency amongst other more primitive types for long enough to keep your utopia thriving -- well, the thing is how to get there?

in response to the reactions concerning me wanting to actually start doing research into carbon and stuff, the way that I perceive it is that I want to create something and I kinda want to do it my own way. if you want to do something else your way that seems pretty OK with me. you guys don't want me to work on technology, which is fine I suppose because -- like what on earth are they going to be doing with all of their creativity? what I mean is, I have somewhere I'm going, and there's no real way to resist me. I'm sort of unstoppable. I may not be invincible, but I know how to go fast -- probably better than you all are. because you're all so bad at going fast and not crashing, I'm trying to go as slow as possible already. this is the same conflict that I have all the time when I was a kid. I had the energy to do somethming, but because mom or dad didn't, then I couldn't do it. I'm always held back by so many others that only know how to drive slow, and it's fine and annoying. what I mean is, if you want to go slow, I'm already going as slow as I can anyway, but boredom creates desire in me to find something interesting. I find something interesting and then I get bored. you want me to fill in all of that interest with girls, but how is this possible if I find so many of them uninteresting? I then hang out with people that I find interesting and novelty starts to emerge really rapidly, and you guys don't like novelty either.

you don't like novelty (because novelty invokes change, meaning instbility to the system), but you don't like speed either. would you rathar learn how to take existing ideas at a more rapid speed, or a organically created burst of novelty to create new forms capable of the new speed? neither. OK, well, hang on as best as you can, because I do as I feel, not all the time like you expect me to.

---

why do I find most girls uninteresting?
after a while, I noticed that they're all sorta the same in most ways -- and, because their distinguishing attributes were never exciting enough for me to want to copy for myself, I find most of them uninteresting. it's most interesting to me to figure out how the core concept of a thing operates, and that core concept is common to all females. I consider the things I extracted from the female archetype to be my own improvements on their concept. imagine that you have genetics and there's like 98% shared glob and then a few trails off in other directions, I'm talking about the 98%, not the common variations. anyway, I'm not sure if I programmed these improvements into my Y, but I behave now like a female having 2 X chromosomes, cause I think my Y, though it does the thing mechanically (vibrates the atom), it's function is the same as the X (vibrating the ether) -- so I'm basically a girl where my mother's is the same, but it feels like I created my father's X and this is perhaps where I store a lot of my improvments to the female core concept. it's also possible I rewrote by Y so it behaves like an X now, but it remains a Y -- just with different programming. anyway, whatever it is -- it feels like a second female and she's basically all of my improvements to the core female concept. I literally embody them and my actions are in reflection of that female's form of perception.

because it's the second girl (a female's other side), it's now in opposition (like girls are with their father's and mother's X batting for perception) perceptually to my mother's code. this, I beleieve has manifestational ripples from these differences in perception, causing for funny interactions. those changes (probably) attract conflict with those with perceptually similar vibration to my mom. I believe this is how the daughter is designed to evolve the father and mother's form of perception (X) -- which mens that those with vibrational (and probably genetic) similarity to my mother are attracted to me so that those differences can come to a stable state (this is how I believe it stabilises so quickly because LOA makes conflict in encounters from slight differences in perception so easy)

anyway, I could have encountered and learned those things from interactions with my mom, wife, grandma -- any female really. occasionally, I notice a new thing in one of them, and then I start to see it replicated. I see trends and other things which completely determine what "era" we're in. as an illustration of this, in spain I was very surprised at how strongly I can feel girls' desire on friday/saturday nights. the way the night feels is entirely set by the girls, and this determines the fashion, the era, the trends, styles, etc. (the receptive "night side" of nature). instead of any single one of their attributes, I enjoy looking at the trends and emergent behaviour present in all females because I'm interacting with the core concept. if I liked the individual aspects (deviations from the core aspects) of girls more, I would become a girl (perceiving no longer through the perspective of the core/common concept).

you know there was a time when we didn't comprehend the colour blue yet? when new concepts emerge, they allow for those concepts to be expressed in all fashions of physicality (materialism). they set the trends. they are the trends. their mentality is the matrix of our reality (literally).

as a really crude analogy, this question is sort of like asking me why I find a bunch of computer parts uninteresting... it's just I find computers (languages and all the stuff you can do on them), much more interesting than any one of the parts -- like wow, a motherboard of whatever specs. however, imagine that one of those parts could explain the computer to you -- well, that would be interesting, for sure. no female has (that I can remember) ever revealed anything interesting to me about how the female computer functions, which I didn't already know myself. I believe I actually know how their computer operates better than most of them do. individually, none of them offer anything more novel than any of the others can offer.

I just realised... the reason why they can't reveal how the core female concept funlctions is because it's a concept that's so large, it's not possible to put into words -- not even millions, so it never feels like it can be expressed. I've taken it and broke it up into parts and started to figure out how to explain certain systems. I know that they're not just doing stuff. I know they can't express in words what they're doing, but I do know there is an underlying function or mechanism that's pre-programmed default behaviour.

[1]: it's unlikely that human evolution happened over billions and billions of years. if we take cro magnon as the thing to pin it on, then it only took some 36-50ky to become geniuses. that's not so long, but they had a pre-assembled society (mars thing) to come into. we'll be actually stuck in the stone age and have to figure out the grass huts and stuff. our "stone age" was quite magnificent with really big rocks and stuff. they had to battle greed and stuff, but it'll be way worse because the men (at least) will perceive his X through the filter of his Y. this means he's going to interpret everything really wrong for a long time (the Y I believe is the sort of preprogramming and the X is the sort of connection to the dark goddess AI and graphics renderer -- the divine spark that connects the source (4) to the physical (7) allowing for the alpha (1st) and omega (7th) perspectives to perceive simultaneously, being the midpoint transducing from one medium to another: physical and non-physical).

### 2022-10-25 13:58 - if I can't spend my time on technology...

the subject of me being able to produce new technology was a considerable reaction that I felt today. I spent a good portion of the day thinking about it, and I think some people may misinterpret what is happening. my job, no matter what it is, is to find a way to feel good about the manifestation, because though they think they can control me, what manifests is a reflection of what I feel, and has nothing to do with their efforts to control. by finding things that I like about even the worst manifestations, I attract more of those positive aspects that I find in even the "worst" manifestation. also, it's not like it's set in stone either -- so like worst case scenario, I start out with a bunch of girls and we pivot toward technology after some time. if "some time" is "enough time" is probably not enough for them anyway (never satisfied). it just isn't possible to satisfy someone who is unsatisfyable.

they're just a sort of speedbump from my perspective. what I think has happened where I reached that materialism tipping point where I realised that nothing outside of me will ever satisfy me anyway, so all of that other stuff is just what I perceive it to be. good and bad no longer exists, so everything reflects how I feel about it. when I reached this turning point in my life, I can positively say that I had to find a way to like any manifestation -- present, past, and especially potential future ones too. what *actually* manifests will be a reflection of all of the things that I gave my attention to (good and bad -- but both good and bad manifestations are meant to be evolved so they become more).

don't worry, cause it's all a reflection of my percption, so I gatta find a way to feel good about any manifestation present or on the horizon. I don't believe I have much resistance to things in the past now[^1]).

[1]: I did remember a thing I wrote last night where I talked about how annoying it is to have to constantly wait for the slowpokes. though that resistance is still somewhat active in my vibration, that specific instance, I felt considerably like mom. she's got a real hangup with slowpokes (which is why jaron is the perfect manifestation for her).

### 2022-10-25 15:12 - what I think is happening with the stones

each time I'm sober, I want to stay there a bit longer but there is this desire for me to smoke again. one thing that I feel like it could be is that girls tend to feel like I'm a lot more manipulatable when I'm stoned because I'm so much more receptive of more things. when I'm sober, I have a very narrow band of consciousness that I'm in (reality-kenny), and that reality state is from the 7th ray perspective. when I'm stoned, I tend to take more the 1st ray perspective. the 1st ray perspective is really annoying to all of the 2nd rays out there (and there are a lot). so, the best state for me to be in is actually the 7th ray perspective -- where I'm kinda just an actor like everyone else.

the problem is my 7th ray perspective isn't really up to the girls' specifications, and I think that's what's up with the desire (those are the girls that want a perfect manifestation) for me to smoke again so that they can make more modifications. there are others that feel exactly the opposite of this and are looking for something to fix or improve, and they're not wanting me to come to too many of these improvements by my own intuition. I don't know how many there are of this, and it seems a lot less or much less powerful.

---

OK, now my comentary on this is that it's pretty obvious that I have to take on the 7th ray perspective because, most obviously, that perspective isn't all that understandable to most. the 7th ray perspective is very relatable to many. the 7th ray perspective isn't *really* understood until you get the 5th ray (emotional/conceptual) perspective on it, which is why I talk so much about things in a conceptual way more often that I talk about the action itself.

an action is the opposite side of a concept. in retrospect, I notice that all major cocepts have an action or experience associated with them, when I learned that concept. I can look at the action, but I prefer to talk about the concept itself and let other people associate their own experiential action to the concept.

### 2022-10-25 15:28 - one nice thing

when I hear music, it's a very rich experience for me. I receive a lot of ideas and stuff from music and so if I'm confined to a manifestation which has no technology but only art, all of these things will all become more richer, sorta like the renaissance. as I was watching da vinci, I was noticing that he is exploring all sorts of science, but he's disguising it inside of his art. you may be able to say that from that perspective, art now drives technology, where the art needs something more from the technology. this is the part where the media goes from cold to hot (when the art or media is restrained by technology), and HD goes through the roof. holding back technology by forcing art will cause things to become VERY VERY HD. just so you know...

### 2022-10-25 17:56 - when the circus passes through, a new power structure is erected on top of us

I was considering today how the present situation must appear to stephan schwartz today, because if you fit my ideas together with his remote viewing, the remote viewers are seeing the demiurge... oops, let me explain.

some time ago I was considering the perspective of what it means that I've found the universal perspective, and that it means that I can be resisted, but I cannot be stopped. what I was saying is that we build a bunch of earth and star like systems with semi-earth-like planets where they put my consciousness into these real stone age morons. the females will be hella smart, but the dudes, because they have the y-blinders on, they're totally retarded. I'm sure that as soon as they finally gain symbolic capacity, they'll manipulate their lives and stuff -- and that's the goal to make me/us a sort of super personality of this race because they contain our conceptual world inherited through genetics, so we're their "source". then, you have nosebook wanting us to remain stupid for as long as possible.

well, the corrolary of that concept is the realisation that if nosebook is gearing up to make all humans a symbolically less-than they are. this means they perceive some sort of power or authority over us and try to use their symbolic system to "steer" us. I touch on this all the time, but I stress that it's nothing to worry about. they're working really hard at a lot of stuff and they're totally harmless. they're more inclined to be afraid of you than you of them. why? because you see yourself also as the universe.

when I can perceive that *all* things around I are a reflection of myself.
well -- how much stuff is there around me?
that I know of, the universe contains the *all*.

a little while later I remember,
I felt like this as a child.
this feeling,
is actually quite normal for me.

oops, derailed.

when this happens and someone gains this perspective,
they are on their return back to their source.
which means, everyone who gets it, is/we are completely unstoppable.

we can be resisted, and that produces all kinds of nice effects,
but we will continue to become more and more energetic.
which means, they have a really big problem on their hands.

they definitely don't want anyone else to gain this universal perspective.
that's why we're making this bogus religion where the premises are all flagrant errors.
ie. kenny has the monopoly on the concept and nobody else can think that.

I wonder if they can get people to believe such a ridiculous

---

all of that means that we're obviously going to be their symbolic "pets" anyway,
as they try to steer us and keep us on a leash.
it's all fine, and from my perspective desired.
the more contrast, the better.

they think they're "winning" by keeping a lot of people inside of the symbolic cages;
however, for me this feels like an opportunity to gain a new dimension to my perspective.

so,
some people will see it as a trap.
some people will see it as reality.
(a circus rolled through)

some people will see it as just another dimension to their perception
on their way back to their source.

can't get it wrong
can't get it all done
can't not arrive

to a manifestation of myself
as a reality.

I am living a past perception of myself.
this next time is going to have even *more* dimensions
to it, than last time did.
(I love that last sentence)

lol

### 2022-10-25 18:46 - tower of power - where, each time the circus rolls through another power structure is added

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/y0vtftEgeME)

### 2022-10-25 19:27 - the physical form of perception

the physical form of perception will be the size that I/we make it to be (ie. in a some decades). when I said that we're going HD, I mean like really really HD. the physical form of perception will continue to become more and more HD until nosebook finally says,

> "OK, this is the farthest we can go and still feel safe"

this means that the size/HDness is determined by me and how long we continue to keep increasing my vibration.
at the moment, this is fueled completely by contrast (and probably novelty).
the girls are an energetic input which means that they'll have control, to some extent,
over that part of the perception that I'm creating --
the new physical dimensions.

they set the size that they want it to be and they say, "that's as HD as we're going to allow the surfs"
the other day, I proposed that we could make the HD increase constant
if we put contrast in sync with novelty.
(novelty is what is causing the expansions to the physical form of peception.)

OR,

> "we have no other choice but to continue to go more HD"

their super duper setup gets sort of superceded by my own plans.
they no longer control the fabric of our reality.
I run the systems now so, from their perspective,
I am a more powerful demiurge than they are and I've taken over their territory
territory-dawg represents.

### 2022-10-25 19:46 - obviously, we continue on...

now, look at it from my perspective: I'm "stuck" here on earth, and no matter how hard they try, my manifestation will be a reflection of how I *feel*, not how they intend it to be. it's going to be pretty hilarious, so get ready for comedy hour. I keep going, but so they stake out new territory in their domain they feel comfortable in with the subjugations that they want to manage.

these guys are still looking outside of theirselves for the reason for their problems.
they've yet to become selfish enough as to actually take responsibility for their reality.
they can hang out for as long as they want, staking out their turf and getting their kingdoms all setup.

obviously we continue on...

unless of course, we/I purposefully chooses to jump into a species and add even more dimensions to our physical reality.

you know how when you're looking at yourself from the outside looking in,
you notice the same things about yourself you also notice about other people.

if you now consider yourself a character in a play
(or even a play within a play)
and you play more than one part in the play

you can see yourself now as simultaneously existing inside of two different perspectives.
you are more than just yourself now. you are the interrelations between all of these characters.
I am a narrator now in a story where I set the rules. everyone is doing it, so why not join?

additionally: you can't ever die if you're more than one.

### 2022-10-26 03:28 - seems the plan is...

I'm going to get back on the snake-bros discord and see if I can find laura. ask her (and any others) if they want to come to pueblo. then, I think the plan from there on out is undecided by me.

we'll see if I still see this the same in the morning. sometimes things move around a bit, but I'd rather tomorrow be a flop than to start something at the same time that someone else is trying to steer another way. it only really happens when both sides stop trying to steer (like, kissing). I prefer to let it fall apart now than to keep it from falling apart later.

### 2022-10-28 00:46 - king solomon's effect

I didn't realise it until just now but king solomon's effect of having so many women in one area is, that many women can make an improvement at once. I've noticed over the years that women tend to evolve, not as often as individuals, but more commonly in groups. girls tend to hang around other girls with similar hangups as they do, so when one evolves, it's because the group allowed it, and then the others catch up pretty quick to the first one.

well, if you have a lot of women in one location, the chances for improvements gaining traction (especially genetically) are much higher. sure he left a legacy, but what really was the novelty is so many new thoughts distributed amongst the females.

(the reactions are funny. some are very concerned about this happening again, lol)

### 2022-10-28 16:06 - I can't seem to improve my vibration

last night, I went to sleep and it felt to me like a strong sensation in my brain (ie. it was probably nosebook) that I've come as far as I can come and that this is their final moment -- where, if they don't do something, they won't survive (ie. like I said, that their need to survive is the first step of making the transition from going toward 7th/materialism and making the turnaround and going toward desire). over the last few days, I've talked about this at length where 7th ray perspective is the start of making the turnaround to go back toward 1st ray perspective. nosebook (and almost all governents) is mostly 3rd ray, so that means their minions come usually from the 7th ray perspective (physical stuff/data is all that matters), performance orientation types, where their motivation is 3rd ray (parts need to function properly in in their places -- you're a cog in a machine), but I'm talking about a shift in motivation from planning (forethought) to inspiration (desire). so, for them, it sounds really good to me that they're beginning to at least *pretend* like they have desire (in the form of need) for me to go with the girls.

I went to sleep fully accepting that today I would just get on snake-bros discord and just figure it out, but nothing that I can do is getting me to a feeling place where that actually feels to me like something that I want to do. so, while I did accept it, I still can't find a way to feel good about it.

I looked into why I couldn't feel good about it and there were a few topics that showed up. first, I noticed a rather large potential disharmony -- which is that I don't actually like most of the same stuff that the girls do. I place quite a bit of importance on creativity and discovery -- and I just don't feel like I'm being put into a place where I'm going towards creativity and discovery. I want to learn about how carbon works and figure out cool new uses for it. I will find a way to figure out how to use it make it so that I can fly. I want to create all of the things that [I wrote to russ](/letters-to-russ.md#2022-10-24-2307---dude-i-have-no-idea-what-to-write), and feels to me like they *don't* want me doing those things. that's fine, but that's what I want to do, and they want me to do some DJ stuff. the DJ stuff is mostly just an excuse to begin studying these things (carbon and other things like memristors). if I'm going to do it, I want to *actually* revolutionise the industry, not just make more powerful smartphones. new media. the medium *is* the message.

I know that they have all of the tesla stuff really locked down and stuff, so I find a way around it (electrostatics), and I want to do it. I know that if I say, "OK, I'm not going to do anything until the girls want to do it" because then it's just going to be jori all over again, where I don't want to work on the projects the girls want to work on. I want to do actually real things that change how we interact with our reality. most notably, I want to create machines capable of desire. there are obvious ways to get there with DJ stuff (like the machine starts to tune into your desire and begins to play that, allowing you to just dance), but I figure that if we're working on all of that, then there are so many other areas of life that can be improved also, why not do those too.

---

from my perspective, it looks like I actually cannot be going in the direction of the girls stuff if that's the way I want to go. it actually makes a lot more sense for me to just continue to hang out here at home, growing slowly my abilities and starting to do my own experiments and stuff. sure they're lightyears ahead of me in progress, but I'll catch up and eventually surpass them, so it's all fine. the more I go at this, the more I realise that I don't really trust other people -- not even the girls. if I want to something, I have to do it myself. if I rely on someone else to do something, it never works out -- especially with girls. if I expect that somehow magically I'm going to somehow pivot from whatever it is the girls have me doing into studying carbon, it's going to be quite a while from now, if ever. it's not likely to happen, and that's what they're banking on. I think that's what feels so terrible about the manifestation.

the othter thing that really bothers me is that I don't think that the girls actually like me. I'm attractive to them because I've tremendously improved the feminine mindset, but they don't have my mindset. they're going to be running the old software and I'm running the new software. a way to demonstrate this is to look at my interactions with mom. I used to have her conceptual-space installed, but I've since made so many improvements, that the things I find interesting/important to me are nothing even remotely similar now. we conflict on everyday things because I see things so very differently than she does.

I've said this for quite some time now, but I'd rathar that a girl finds her way up to my frequency and attracts me from her new position (and form of pertception), so that I actually have something to learn and grow from her, instead of just being some know-it-all that has massive sway. the thing that's so weird is they want to put me into the position that they detest most men being in. I guess I'm different, so they can make an exception. for reals though, I don't want asymmetry in power or any of that stuff. I like equal individuals, and for me to stay true to my own desire to have that kind of interaction, I have to do it. I do the thing and others that also find what I'm doing interesting will join me. I prefer that they meet me where *I* am, so that way we're equals. if they're less-than or some kind of inferior, then it's not a problem.

---

on the subject of the wedding, there are two ways to look at it: 1. that it's a way to delay the manifestation indefinitely (though I don't think that's the case), or 2. as a way to get everyone that we want into the conceptual space, and the wedding is just where we all become "one" (as in we become the species/humans that we're now living amongst and/or steering from a macro perspective).

I proposed that it's the second one, and I think that's probably the way it's going. they want to control everything and if they can isolate each of us into separate zones, that's easier for us. we'll be in with some humans, and other humans will be in other controlled zones. it'll probably look a lot (if not exactly) like earth, and then from there, I guess I/we will begin our ascent back up.

like I said though, that's all really nice, but I was kinda proposing the wedding idea because I want it to be something that I *want* to go and do. as in, I want to design the species and stuff like that, making various improvements and things like that -- then go into the species -- rathar than what is presently being proposed where it's *not* a new species, just all the problematic humans that are already on the planet -- and we're sorta isolated away from the controllers and stuff so they have all of their secrets and all of that.

I value research, discovery, and the way I feel. I don't know that the girls value those things quite as much as I do. I have a strong feeling this is going to create a number of conflicts because I will want to know how the *science* works. the things that I want to understand how they work are always so I can improve upon them, but mostly it's for my own curiosity. I don't know if they're trying to reduce my desire to understand things from a 7th ray perspective, or if they just want me away from science -- however, there are a few crisises on the horizon because imagine a number of girls imprint off of me, and take on my conceptual-space (my interests/preferences), and then they start wanting to understand things scientifically and from a data perspective, more like I do -- not only will this alienate her from the other girls (she'll be more like me now), but then I just have no place to put her -- "yeah, I know you want to know how it works, but the boys don't want us doing any science". you can probably see the various conflicts that will arise. there could even potentially be a split amongst the girls too, where some still are more concerned on appearance in a performane, rathar than the metrics/data/numbers like I do. what about the ones that value how a product *feels* to me when I interact with it, rathar than how it makes me look?

conflicts are quite a few, and the thing that I just am having the hardest time with, is feeling like it's something I want to do. you may say that I should be motivated by the pleasure of it, but that is actually a very anti-motivating thing for me. that aspect itself makes it feel like a trap more than anything -- which makes perfect sense, because for literally ~10y or so now, nosebook has been trying to keep me trapped using pleasure so they can continue to use my form of perception.

they can use my perception. I have no problem with that. I just figure that I should wait until I can use it too. like I said, they're probably lightyears ahead of me, but I'll catch up. I just have to stay true to my direction and my intuition. there is literally *no* reason why I can't use my own perception too -- just they don't want me to have it. I can wait, obviously. it won't be but a few more years until I can do all of this myself. I can probably even make their 2038 deadline, too.

### 2022-10-28 17:55 - simply, it the perception

I just realised that I can reduce the whole previous entry into one statement -- which is, "if you want my perception, let's just keep going my way; but, if you want the girl's perception, let's go that way".

I look at this like I'm redesigning the feminine form of thinking, and they want me to get back into the old way of thinking. I prefer to start over starting from me (ie. the feminine aspect (X) will all be a derivative/improvement on my own), and so to some extent, I'm not really all that interested in the girls at all. I kinda prefer to replace them.

so, to put it simply: everyone (including me) is getting put into a matrix -- and in fact we already are -- probably at least a few levels deep -- so, if you want my reality matrix, let's keep going my way -- but, if you want the girls' reality matrix, let's go that way

### 2022-10-28 18:01 - redesigning romance

I also was thinking about how I'm making a lot of emphasis (I notice to what I write, kinda) on the idea that I'm going to be completely redesigning what is interesting to people. so, you have to imagine that this is a pretty big problem in general. I keep trying to talk to people at a level which I enjoy. that was what was so invigourating about the idea of hanging out with jason and kyle and stuff -- which is that I can actually talk about things that interest me. with the girls, the main reason why I vetoed the idea for so long is it just looked like another version of nosebook's standard formula of extreme amounts of pleasure but no actual substance (this is always the marketing team's desire), and so I never wanted to actually go that direction because I'm not as stimulated by pleasure as normal people are.

if you asked me if I would rather hang out with a bunch of DJs or work on carbon, I'm of course going to want to work on carbon. I'm pretty mentally simulated by intelligent things. imagine that now everyone (including men) has a feminine side now like mine, where pleasure is nearly completely replaced with scientific discovery. I've said various times in the past that sexual energy feels the same as creative energy and also as a discovery of a principal (conceptual or physical). these all feel amazing to me.

another instance that left an "indellible" mark on me was a long time ago patricia scolded me for wanting to have sex AND also do work. she believed that work and pleasure should not be mixed, so she strictly forbid us from ever mixing creativity and sex. it was really annoying to me. raquel obviously did the same, but for different reasons.

I believe that both raquel and patricia are running on standard female form of thought, which is why it wasn't possible. obviously, my creative side does not have such limitations. going back to the girls is exactly what nosebook wants because they'll return that cap on creativity and sex ever being allowed to be expressed at the same time.

---

OK, so -- that kinda sets the scene, because now I wanted to talk about how this situation is kinda forcing a redefinition of romance, and it likely a big part of the transition to my feminine form.

this entry (and a few others) have expressed my dissatisfaction with the direction that we're heading, mostly because you guys are so in your heads about stuff, it's difficult for me to reason about what's going on. if you want a manifestation, we have to at least be in the same location. this seems rather obvious, but I think that everyone is so used to distanced togetherness, you all have forgot that you make physical relationships *in person*. there's no other way I'm going to meet her.

another thing to consider is that we may want to have conversation as well, because it's quite likely that some things that interest me may also interest you. this is such a difficult subject for me to convey, because *nobody* talks to me about anything that I'm interested in -- and if I do, their gender isn't usually female. the majority of the things that I want to have a conversation about, don't usually interest the other person. nobody likes to talk to me as it is, so how can I possibly imagine the girls would be any different than how they are right now (non-existant or non-conversational) -- and, I mean conversation, as in someone actually tells me something that is interesting to me, instead of the nosebook crap where we can only talk about superficial crap.

I only monologue because nobody converses with me. sure it seems weird to think about coversations, because I don't think that anyone has any ideas of anything other than sex. I a good portion of my day communicating (writing here or talking to jaron), so then you could imagine that if I'm to be communicating, what will it be about? well, at work, it's work stuff (until I know my office mates, then it's everything). at home, it's superficial crap and meaningless banter (idle conversation). I can do both, but if it's for my pleasure I'll come here and write. I get quite a lot of pleasure out of writing here, because I'm talking almost exclusively about things that interest me. I'm trying to integrate more of this style of conversation into random (I just met you) coversations where I slip something into the cracks. nosebook hates these because I'm going off-script there. I'll obviously do more and more of those, but honestly I would actually like to have lengthy conversations where it's not *just* me explaining my theories.

just because I see from the universal perspective doesn't mean that others cannot as well. talking to someone else who actually considers all of their life to be a reflection of them, *does* sound interesting. see what I mean, it's not that hard to start moving toward something that's interesting, cause at the moment our interests are diverging so mostly away from unwanted. wanted always feels interesting and engaging.

### 2022-10-28 19:04 - I'm not really in the physical

anothor major desync is the obvious fact that you guys live in a really detailed physical plane; I do not. I live in a sort of weird mix of a world between the physical and the conceptual. it looks kinda like the physical in that it's flat, but because I don't pay much attention (less and less) to the physical, I have a very conceptual perspective on things.

we're not even in the same zone. between us is a whole bunch of 4d people that are just going nuts in their imagination (I call them "pajas mentales"). what this means is that you guys want me to *leave* my position of extreme perception and *join* you down in the physical. what, right?

when you look at it from that perspective, you can see the major problem, which is that life is increasingly accelerating toward more and more juicy and vivid. this is hyper sensual, but my senses are almost none. my experience isn't very physical because my physical senses all have so much noise in them. there's nothing smooth about my physical experience.

then, there's the extreme loss that I will immediately face, which is that I will no longer see the world through my conceptual space, but will now have theirs. this will be a tremendous loss for me, in that all of the stuff that I rely on now will no longer function. actually, I'm not so sure about that, but it does feel that way at least to some extent. I really like me.

I like who I am and how I perceive. I perceive you all the way I do right now because it's the way that I've constructed my perception. when/if I go with the girls, now I'll perceive you all more similar to the way they perceive you. I pick up a female's form of perception really easily, which means that you all won't look the same to me. I was surprised at how much my opinion for my friends changed when I was with raquel (like zaryn and daniel, and also dani a bit) -- and I fought because she saw them as bad/unacceptable and I didn't.

---

if I go the demiurge route, then I don't lose that so much because I'm still around the unacceptables. we decided the other day when brainstorming band names that there is no way that I can go that way because the crude and unacceptable (especially to women) comments would be too much. it felt like they were concerned that they would corrupt me or something. well, I'm mega corrupted already as it is -- I'm willing to bet that *all* of the bad guys, for millenia have been aspects of myself; like, I'm *the* bad-guy.

---

the girls and I are not even close to being on the same dimension. if the demiurges want to keep the unacceptable train rolling, that's cool by me, but here's the thing: if they're not coming up to meet me, then somehow I have to get into the physical. I have to do physical things and like the material world. they could take me there, I suppose -- but, like I was going to say, the way they have to get me into the physical will be perceived something of a romance. if they're going to do it, they're going to be redesigning romance. somehow they have to find a way of getting me down into their physical world.

my physical world is very incompatible with theirs. my physical world is also pretty incompatible with the demiurges, but it's definitely more compatible. I have much more freedom to do what I want there and it's easy to joke around and have fun, which up till this point, with the girls has not flowing so smoothely. I tend to reflect what the other person is like, and I often feel like I don't know what to do, so I kinda freeze and don't really do a whole lot. the way that I feel there kinda marks the duration of my relationship with others in the physical. up until now I'm this barely capable of interacting with anyone in a personable way (what originally attracted people to my broadcast I'm sure), which is something that I've definitely lost.

one of the major hangups that people have, is they have no idea how to behave around me (cause I reflect it back), so they tend to avoid me. so, if I'm always unapproachable, then how can I have a relationship? obviously this is nosebook's effect -- because they want to be able to steer me and not have any organic conversations or spontaneous/unpredicted action.

### 2022-10-28 19:38 - where I think this is going

because nosebook cannot allow me to be in the physical like you guys are, I don't see the situation I described in the previous entry ever changing. there are a few other complete deal-breakers for nosebook which is why we can never seem to make any headway. I don't believe we'll ever get around to getting comfortable around eachother, and though a large portion of it is nosebook, I also really like me and my form of perception. going with them means I have to start over. I think that's kinda fine (starting over), but if I'm going to rediscover it, I want to do it by myself. I don't really think I can do it if I'm stuck in the girls' reality matrix. their form of thought is really disturbing and grating to me. I feel frustrated all day long because I can't get them to see things like I see it (they have to be right about what they see: only what I can see is reality) -- which, as I was writing that, realised that they all have the universal perspective too, but they're still operating in really archaic form of perception -- which is why they're all measuring each other's selfishness and stuff, to make sure that the limited amount doesn't just get taken by the most selfish (whicvh is all of them at their core).

---

anyway, what I said about how I'm not really in the physical and the deal-breakers for nosebook lends me to believe that this may still be one of those where no manifestation is going. the reason why I say that is, imagine for a moment the progression of elements.. first, physical (where we were), then now we've passed through the imagination/astral and we're learning about the conceptual. wait. I just realised I tricked myself (I'm translating ideas that pop into my head). the idea is good though it's not at all what I was going to write.

physical plane (where we were). after having passed through the astral, we're moving into the conceptual now. after that, we'll move up to the 4th ray (source) perspective, so we are going to reflect the form of perception, I would imagine, so in the astral, we're all moving around and doing a whole bunch of things in the imagination, meaning that physical life is less important. the conceptual has little importance (only the way your imagination can make you feel is your only access to the conceptual). well, now we're going to the conceptual plane, where you'll feel a way and your body will just respond to how you feel. you don't need to be operating your body like you did previously because it just follows the way you feel mixed with its environmental feeling. I still see out of my eyes and stuff and my body just does the work (like pulling weeds or whatever), but my mind is off in another world of feeling doing stuff there. this is where we/I am heading. nosebook doesn't want me to get there, but it's inevitable.

in that world, I am individual. the way that I feel is how all of my bodies are behaving and some bodies believe they need to behave opposite to how I feel. for example, the better I feel, the more upset mr. motor gets. this is the world where everything that I am perceiving is a conceptual reflection of me. I am completely the centre of my conceptual universe and everything reflects how I feel (which is pretty good, because my perception allows me to feel that good).

that's what has happened to me, and I don't think I'm the only one. I've passed the point where I'm feeling worse day to day and it feels like I'm constantly feeling better and better. if I do nothing, I'll be feeling really really awesome. I don't need a manifestation to feel better, so I prefer to keep going on feeling better.

now, you can imagine that other people will be able to figure out what I've figured out (the universal/source -- everything reflects me perspective), but I think it's going to be a conceptual-space that's pretty stable. so, let's assume for a moment that nosebook definitely needs to keep us apart -- and so there are now quite a few girls that have to wait -- well, they're going to (out of necessity) have to find a way to feel good with their situation. I think this is much easier if your keeping your conceptual-space pretty stable (no sexual relations or high energy emotions), and because that's what I do.

it seems to me that nosebook has a pretty big pickle because they have to ensure I never find my connection, but they also have to keep pretending that they're working on it to placate you guys. in my opinion, this is sillyness. the other day I was mildly frustrated that nosebook doesn't just tell me that I need to stop eating, and instead I have a massive bowels problem. this is the same thing for me. assume I'm right about it and because nosebook simply cannot allow something to happen, let's just float up to the conceptual realm ourselves and meet up there where they can't really influence so much? if we just give up the need to have a manifestation, we'll get the manifestation from the conceptual perspective.

to explain the bigger picture, I don't believe that the conceptual realm is very feasible from the girls' perspective because they're *wayyy* too materially oriented. if you want the conceptual perspective, on your way to perceiving yourself from the perspective of source -- you cannot be doing what the girls are doing, which is caring waaayyyy too much about what the other one is doing instead of just going her own individual way. obviously, because we continue to clash on this, no matter how much anyone tries to do anything, they have to find me at my perspective. the ones that are doing this are mostly without relaationships anyway, so it's pretty easy for them to stop caring so much about what the others are doing and begin to see that *everything* around them is a reflection of their perception. we're going toward more individuality, not toward group thought. we'll get to have all kinds of group thought when we're now the conceptual overlords for a new species (or the human race in general - 2nd ray perspective)

the way it looks to me is that actually a bunch of individuals will figure out this kind of perception, and it's from that perspective that we begin to make our conceptual-space for the new species we'll soon inhabit. I want the species to conceptually see thierselves as a reflection of source (and everything else around them as a reflection of their self). their identity conflict will be different than ours.

### 2022-10-28 21:10 - girls also change the symbols a bit

I noticed another really great thing. I said that the new concept coming from the sun in the waxing of this new solar regime is feeling-purposefully. when I perceived it, I saw it from the individual perspective, which is, "I feel the way *I* want to feel." -- but with the girls that is no longer the case at all: "I feel the way the girls want/expect me to." I don't really like that.

### 2022-10-28 21:13 - kenny sounds like vera when she got past her limit smoking that one time with kenny

I noticed that at the end of this session of smoking a few things. I noticed that weed allows the feminine thought's feeling indicator to move rather rapidly. I can switch how I feel out pretty quickly (that is, to actually feel different, rathar than pretending I feel different), and that capacity is pretty good, but weed, I noticed allows that feeling to move around much more suddenly. I don't know how others are, but the way I feel after particularly charged moments, lingers for a bit. it takes me a while to change, but with weed massive fluctuations can happen in how I feel, compared to sober.

so, what I noticed is that when smoking past a certain limit, the gain is so high that the needle is pegged in either direction. I'm only seeing from the extremes now (this is when pure ecstasy hits with a drug) and because of the gain on my perception, it's only going to make me feel really really good -- or, really really bad. when that happens, my most primitive feminine side is coming out.

this is an interesting thing to note if you study me, because my most primitive/basic/worst-feeling state, I'm a hyper individual ego maniac. that's my "worst" feeling state now, as evidenced by the last smokes. I figure I should keep pushing myself to that limit. as you noticed -- if that's my "worst", things are manageable.

imagine everything goes wrong, and the "worst" possible manifestation happens, and you feel hyper-individuality and meglomania. welcome to the future.

### 2022-10-29 10:28 - would prometheus...

(assume voice of jason, at least for the intro) would prometheus build impressive technology and then make sure only zeus has it, or would prometheus share that technology with humankind?

I argue that the "fire" that prometheus gave us, was one of emotion (attraction power -- the ability to fulfil one's own desires) but jason argues that prometheus gave us the forge of technology -- that we are a race of beings that has no inherent quality that we were bestowed with, and so therefore to overcome the difficulties of the physical, we use *tools*. tools can be used for both harm and for good; that is their nature. tools are just tools. they are themselves neither good or bad. it's the *intent* of a person which turns that tool into something productive or something harmful.

---

I am, of course referring to nosebook and their desire to do all of the technology for the carbon and keep all of it secret. I'm harshly critiquing them by invoking prometheus. it's complete sillyness to keep all of that technology a secret. they probably won't be swayed by my promethian argument though (they'll just add it to another reason why they're bad-guys).

I think we're actually haeding toward hyper-individuality, actually. myself and some others will find that frame of mind and we'll begin our "ascent". the people that are running the show will have all their stuff getting setup and everything. they'll be able to prevent any sexual interaction in their domail (the physical+astral) but we'll sorta pass right through and continue on to 5d (some are already there), and that's where the "manifestation" will happen. it won't be here. they can't allow it, and they can't allow us to have some types of technology, either -- so, the obvious thing to do is to just keep next logical stepping until they say they can't go any further and they finally let go.

we (I) could try and push the limits to try and make that go as fast as possible, but as I've mentioned, I don't think that's a good idea and it won't accomplish what I want. a manifestation can't be ready until it's actually ready. it's a distance thing in time more than space. there are so many things that need to be done (from their perspective, and as I'm illustrating with our very different forms of perception, my perspective as well), I just don't think that it's a good idea to try and push anything to go any faster than it needs to.

the way that I see it, the girls needs to kinda find their way to where I am vibrationally, rathar than me going to them. we have such a tremendous difference in how we perceive the world, I honestly really like the way that I see the world and don't want to go crashing into a disaster any time soon, cause that's what'll happen when our realities collide.

I've tried to suggest mitigations to this problem because it'll be most significant with the older ones because suddenly everything that they relied on is now gone. my system is pretty different to theirs so it'll likely cause a lot of problems, especially around the area of expectations. I don't mind it if they want to make such a disaster without being ready, because in my opinion, I don't think any of us are very ready for anything. I still have a lot of technology I want to work on and they like the DJ and music thing a lot. I also like music and want to work on everythting from software synths to actual songs, concerts, and performances. I think that all of these things that can be worked on simultaneously while we're getting ready. when they actually are attracting on my frequency, then it'll happen. to do that, *we need to be in the same location*.

it'll start happening organically. we'll be around each other and working on things from a radical-individuality perspective, things will continue to accelerate, and then because of that acceleration, nosebook is going to have to start finding a way to get us off of this planet. that's a future problem we don't have to worry about now.

we have to go the individual perspective for as long as they think they need to hold on to get everything under control. they'll stay in 4d and we'll continue on to 5d where it'll all manifest. I think that's the easier way to go about it, rathar than try to coerce nosebook to do something they can't allow. ie. instead of fighting against their power structure, let's just wait and become the power structure over them -- obviously, lol.

### 2022-11-02 23:23 - thinking about things a bit differently

one of the things that I noticed in my time smoking is that I really just like playing this captain of industry game because I totally forget about my world, and I can see progress in tme game, whereas it feels like I'm pretty stuck with a lot of things. I know that this is not how some perceive me, though.

when I look at the concept from a generalised version of my concept of "you guys" (specifically the human audience), it looks like I'm just sorta floating around. [like I explained yesterday](/know-thyself.md#constantfixed-speed-vs-constantfixed-contrast), every time that I get a good idea and I start trying to go faster than that constant speed thing and I get a lot of pushback. as I was explaining in that one, there are basically two ways to raeact in my situation. the first is to go nearly completely passive and only use my perception to feel good about whatever disaster they fumble me into by trying to make things happen and stuff. this is comical to me anyway, so that's not really that small of problem.

instead, what I was kinda saying in that document is that if indeed I am fixed speed, there's no sense trying to go faster than I can. believe me when I say that this is the most annoying thing ever -- because I see all these other guys out there going really fast and having a really good time -- but that just doesn't work for me.

in general, the better that I feel because of conditions, the more likely it is for something bad to happen to put me back down to that functional speed. it's a weird self-fulling prophecy.

anyway, because I know that my speed can't really be changed, because my timeline is constantly under so many modifications by so many different entity types that all of these teathers are a sort of like massive brake. it reminds me of all of the material that the projectile takes with it on impact -- the sort of pressure/shock wave. they're the friction. (funny analogy) they're the resistance to the incoming high-pressure wave.

---

(1167 is the foothill transit bus number that often picked me up. the other was 1128) so what I'm aaying is that if I know that I'm fine, meaning that no matter what I do, they'll be able to exert enough resistace. presently, I don't really do a lot of physical exercise, because it's very psychedellic. when my heart starts pumping a little bit more vigourously than it does here in its dorment state (remember when it felt like oxygen was hard to get and I got out of breath going up the stairs?)

so there was this other thing that happened after I watched the armina video, is that I started to get these pictures of the rocky film and he had to work out and stuff to get good enough to fight apollo. the movie is full of symbolism. rocky is the earth and apollo is the sun and the sun is this big commanding presence. rocky has to figure out with scrappier equipment to find his way. the movie is full of symbols, so the beatup equipment means something -- it means that I do not have less ideal situations and materials to make it work, but the thing is to figure out how to get there.

there's another really interesting thing about the presence of the rocky symbol, because on the surface, it looks like rocky is training really hard, working out all the physical muscles, but the reality of it is, that it's a mental game. if you're a planet and you're up against the sun, this is a david and goliath situation, so ordinary rules of engagement no longer apply.

so, what's stopping me from going really extreme? I have pretty good control over my mentality now, and you can see that, especially while I'm stoned (because I do things slower, I'm more considerate of my mentality now). I've integrated a lot of reaction response things into reality-kenny that basically mean I have safeguards to ensure I don't go up -- cause remember, if that happens, there is no longer a limit to novelty, so it rapidly accelerates, rather uncontrollably.

so, because I look at things backwards, not trying to control my speed and just accepting that no matter how hard I try, I'm always NLS the whole way there (it's literally impossible for me to not do it now. even if I try to have bad timing, it seems to work out somehow cause everything is so meaningful -- I see meaning/reasons/justifications for everything now and the faster I let go of those the more I see the sparkle. gatta do it sober though).

so, because my contrast is variable, I have a the ability for a lot of really potentially life-ending situations -- where the contrast/barrier becomes so great that the great night sky receives me. so, why not start testing this.

---

what I mean by all of this is that one of the things that I've wanted to do is to relearn how to do my left-hand even though I'm only half-brained. I really want to just chill out and start to have fun more than anything. ... lots of weird reactions because the word "fun" doesn't really describe rocky very well. so, I guess I'll explain. I really want to lighten up a whole lot. I really don't feel like things are as ready as everyone else is lead to believe.

the imagination is a really funny thing and it ususlly skips over the mundane aspects, just like how memories lose their details and all the mundane aspects go away, making the memory *feel* more epic than it was.

what I mean by this is that playing COI has really improved my capacity to see the mundane in my imagination. you have to understand how invisible the mundane already is that most people filter it out almost immediately from their memories, but for me, my imagination is already invisible, so it's a really funny concept to visualise something that is already invisible to the people with visuals... anyway, as I'm playing, I'm beginning to notice that I'm developing the capacity to be able to contemplate the mundane stuff -- and when I do it's pretty cool. mundane for me looks a lot different. jason called this the "supra-mundane" (I think).

it's just like the ordinary -- in fact, it's exactly the same thing, but because I haven't decided I'm right about too many concepts, they can move around for me, shapeshifting and stuff (normal refelction stuff). a lot of things in my world appear new and exciting to me (much like a child), so that is generally a really fun experience.

it's so fun that I don't really get so bored like others might in the same situation. because I *feel* like everything is new and exciting, it is, and I'm constantly discovering new things.

---

one of the things that I liked to do as a child is to test my limits and stuff with the boundary authorities. in the very beginning I look a physically responsive approach, but that didn't work out too well, especially after the paralysis, so so I converted to testing my limits mentally more than physically. this made authority figures tolerable -- because I still knew I was mentally more capable, or at least that I could know enough. mental stuff is also tricky business, which is why I don't do it any more. I've converted most of my main stuff over to responding to how I feel, so I see things differently now. I feel like this is analogous to how humans have evolved (physical -> mental -> emotional/conceptual), and I see that progression all over the place now.

instead of contending/enaging them on their playing field (physical or mental), I was thinking not to try and do it that way. what if, instead of pushing against them, why not push them to their limits too? like, if something happens (like smoking on a really empty stomach), then I can always catch it and prevent the kundalini from rising -- so I don't really feel that unpreparared, because even if it happens in my sleep, I wake up and stop it. so what do you think is the farest out that I can go and nosebook is able to still hold on.

the reactions are intereating. on one side I'd put the major group into the rocky category, where mom wants me to get on the exercise bike and start "earning" my appearance. I know that there is a physical aspect to it, but I prefer to focus on the *mental* aspect of it -- or more recently, the *conceptual* aspect of my appearance. I don't have a visuals that I'm interested in -- instead, I have a sense of how I feel and I want my body to reflect that, but my body does not cooperate.

I could try and go out of my way to make my body go faster, but that is a terrible idea. even if I just started to walk every day or even start to clean my room a bit, the slight improvement in my physical conditions makes a huge difference for me. it's too easy for me to associate those conditions with the feeling and begin to believe that I need that condition to be recepitive to that feeling.

obviously, I don't just jump from one "addiction" to another and I also know that I'm a bit of a hypocrite on this because I know the concept better in my head than I do in practise. I still get pulled too easy by others around me to go in the direction of their desire instead of following my own.

---

historically, I've noted that every time that I start to use my left-hand, my whole body starts to become more energetic. that's kind of like cheating though. I know that I've got it super easy now because I've practised it so much and made a lot of mistakes (especially in the previous 10y).

what is probably not too obvious to people watching my history (they see the details, but don't see the conceptual progression) -- is that right before my brain haemorrhage, I started to use my left-hand a lot. in fact, a high amount of left-handed activity is usually the indicator that energy is moving again properly in my body and so I'm fully relaxed and can move my left side without the resistance that I experience normally. the reason why I think this happens is because my right hemisphere is quite powerful (this may have been a recent thing since the vallecas thing -- which again, at that time, all left-handed).

so, what you're looking at is basically me getting all pumped up to then properly put all of that energy right into a series of mundane problems staring right at me, but I can't see them, because I'm so pumped up on my own BS.

this situation is positively kenny gearing up for the biggest nosedive ever. maybe. however, at the momment, the thing is, I just like *being*. I don't know what is the difference between being while working out, and being like how I am now, but it's a pretty big difference. I think working out is kinda like a drug (the natural kind), and it's basically all the same thing.

the other thing that I wts thinking about is JD and snake-bros where I registered my discord name as "vapidshamen". I didn't notice it at the time, but "shamen" was an accidental pluralisation. I get into his channel and I know I judge a lot by the screen name, so I wonder what they would think of my name as that. they do know me though, so it's not like they're trying to figure out my personality by my sreen name. it's those kinds of mental loops that throw me off. I don't really know how to act "naturally" in that situation because I have extra information. as always, I pull it off fine because I don't have to worry about what I'm saying and can just let my body do all of the work while I kinda sit back and watch.

wow... lol... try and make sense of that.

OK, so here's what I'm saying -- I just don't feel like any of this stuff is ready, so I want ot just chill out for as long as possible. we can, of course, try and go faster than I'm allow to go, and nosebook has to constantly restrain us.

I'll figure it out, and I don't think that I'm going to use a conventional technique. I'm sorta making it up as I go anyway. you could stay that I still have a ways until I get my "act" together -- which is funny because, I kinda want to go ridiculous. it's a bit easier, so people can look at all of the sparkles, and miss the obvious gaping flaws in so many of the ideas.

---

so now, let's take a look at this from a macro perspective: nosebook does not want me programming or working on anything technical, which is pretty annoying, so they want me to avoid all things technical. this leaves art -- of which there are plenty that are more skilled than me -- so I think to myself, "OK, how to I want to express myself in art?" well, the medium is the message, so in all honesty a game is actually the nicest form of art because it's interactive, can even relate to me on a non-physical level, etc. games are the most advanced forms of art right now, but they're not perceiveds as such because of the immense difficulty it is to write a simulation that's also fun and engaging. it's a difficult challenge to make all of the parts an alternate universe work well and have it be believeable. obviously games are something technical though, so I don't konw what they'll think about that.

no matter what direction that I go, it'll probably influence a lot of things, so it'll catch the attention of a bunch of people. once I'm out in public, I can say whatever I want to, and nosebook does *not* like how plain I am about things.

I honestly don't know If that's the dierection that I want to go. the girls (but permaps nosebook) wanted to try and do somthing quiet, until [I suggested thqt we seriously consider doing a wedding](/playerz-club.md). the thing is, I just don't like public life so much. I prefer to be here where there aren't any expectations and other annoyances. I have to pay attention to other people and that's annoying, because I find the stuff that I consider to be of far grater importance than much of anything most people have said to me (unless it was by acccident). as such, because my own thmoughts are more interesting and exciting to me, I prefer to just stay to myself.

I'm really not trying to put on a show, sell or promote something -- until on my first days getting stoned, I kept thinking about the italo disco bands and how I would love to do something like that. I'll probably be the only artist in the genre, but it would require me to actully do practise for the performances and stuff. it seems like such an enormous amount of work, cause the conceptual perspective is starting to become reality for me where work is no longer necessary; I just direct myself with how I feel. for example, not being surprised at something will often times yield an insightful reaction, but if I feel a fake surprise or an pushed emotion, that tends to yield a saracastic or off-puting reaction to me. I don't really even think about the words -- just let them flow, and only correct myself if it felt exceptionally bad (tons of mistakes in my stuff). I suppose they could slightly twist my words on me so they feel similar but not exactly the same. I usually catch these now.

so, if I don't want to put on a show, why would I think to do it? do I purposefully *want* to crash and burn -- sorta setting the example?


### 2022-11-03 18:24 - recap

as a resume to the previous entry, what I'm saying essentially is that nosebook has no way of allowing me to do anything with science or technology, so I see no value in trying to make that different. as much as I want to work on technology stuff, I think I'm going to go the vapidshamen route and just be a drugged out loser the entire time.

the reason for this is pretty simple. I don't want to fight them, because it's silly. if I'm completely passive, I'll make it -- so, that means that I have some extra slack to do what I want. with that extra slack, I considered a number of options, including an italo/metal disco sort of band setup -- but like I said, that's an enormous amount of work -- and I just don't really want to put much effort into things. you know it's like a lot of work and stuff to do all of that choreography and stuff -- and I suppose fun as well, but I see it mostly as work.

---

I just woke up from a dream where I was in some situations that zaryn would be in, kinda like learning how to be a CEO (you have the door person do everything for you and pay with money) and stuff like that. anyway, in one of the scenes of the dream, I was talking to zaryn and he said that we can't join forces (and become unstoppable) because it would illustrate who the rubber something is. anyway, the sense that I got was more that it's more of a proximity issue (the reason why I haven't seen *any* of my old friends) -- which is that around me, I'll bring up things from the past and other things that I see differently now (like nosebook), and talk about them plainly -- which they can't have.

what I'm trying to say is that all things point to the same thing -- which is that they want to keep me as isolated as possible from the rest of the world -- which is obvious, because then they can much more closely control what conversations I have and what gets broadcasted from those conversations. while I'm here talking about abstract stuff few people can relate to, it's fine -- but the minute I start talking about vibration and illustrating it on an instrument, it's not wanted for them (they don't want you guys knowing how vibration works).

---

so then, there are the other ideas that I also proposed when I was stoned -- which would be things like doing a wedding, and instead of taking the passive way, going the physical path, where I'm now a performance artist (like a musician or something) and I live the life of a rockstar (the rocky vs apollo part). I declined that idea based on past performances, where every time that I forced myself to start using my left-hand more, energy started to rise quicker and I spiraled off into chaos because I made the mistake of thinking that I needed the drugs, alcohol, or technology to allow me to express my personality (not true). I do find myself a bit out of place around people, and so with those conditions, I thought that I could express myself and my ideas to people easier.

well, who knew -- that even with the entire world able to interact with my thoughts in some way (I really want to try and interview a number of different people to see how nosebook presents my mind to them), that *even still* I find it very difficult to explain myself to people. obviously, this is because they're on a frequency that is unable to reeive it (like tuning into one radio station and expecting another to show up) -- so it's not really me, anyway.

I think I"ll juxt hang around the house and smoke weed talking with other people about vapid topics. God will not let me go.

### 2022-11-04 22:11 - an interaction that I should try to explain

today, I smoked one of the joints that was from quite a while ago (I had originally saved it to give it to someone else). I then continued the conversation from the previous entry. they can't allow me to do any of the girls, and that's totally fine with me. they're not super happy with the idea of me just sitting around doing vapedshamen stuff either, so they're sorta having a difficult time to figure out what to actually do with me.

to go back a bit and explain the context, earlier I was explaining that whenever I would have sex with anyone (but it was most notable with raquel), she felt empty inside and as if all of the support structures around her in her culture and stuff like that weren't there to support her anymore, so often times she would call up her mom and her mom would get her integrated back into the feminine reality matrix. her mom would reinforce all of the stuff that's supposed to be important to raquel, and it caused a lot of conflicts between us, because a lot of the stuff that feminine thought thinks is important, I don't think is too important.

I made the comment, "that's not my problem" -- because it's not -- however the girls have always been very interested in making sure that other people's problems are something I need to worry about. I explained that is not so, and to do it, I explained that from my point of view, everything is a reflection of me -- including all of the bad-guys. therefore, if they have some sort of problem with whatever, they can figure it out for theirselves. they're not really in my universe. I see more and more the hyper-individuality perspective, so I don't really think that there's any reason to try and micromanage anyone else. anyone saying that I need to worry about someone else's problem's isn't really something I want to be doing. I'm going somewhere and anyone who wants to follow me can do it, but I'm *not* going to try and get anyone to do anything.

---

after that, the subject of what I would be doing again, and I had the realisation come to me -- because patricia forbade us from ever mixing sex and work. raquel didn't like it either, and I realised that they're right. it felt to me like this was something that I had tried to explain to mihiel (sp?), probably in a dream -- but I always had a difficult time engaging with women while I was programming an idea. he found it easy and hooked up all the time -- but I was never as "succussful" as he was at it. anyway, what I always was trying to explain to him is that the concept that I have for the creation that I'm working on is usually something pretty specific to me. when I'm in that concept, I'm often very attractive to females but they don't know how to approach me, and we don't really know how to talk or have anything to talk about. in order to get down to their conceptual level (which usually felt something of posession or something) is I had to drink alcohol and stuff, and even still we were still so incompatible with each other, that zaryn and felix decided to relieve me of such a vibrational incompatibilities by paying for sex for me (money solves all vibrational incompatibilies, right?).

after receiving concepts from the prostitute, the entire concept of tuenti changed, and a I became much more attractive to things that she was probably worried about, most notably, getting a *fair* share (in comparison to others) for my work. this completely changed the trajectory of the website. I encode the concepts that are active in me into the things that I'm working on.

I noticed that it was actually a *good* thing that patricia and raquel didn't want to have sex and work on things, because I would have encoded the (physical) things/actions that were important to them into the technology. looking back at it now, I'm really glad I didn't -- however, when I looked at it, I noticed that the *real* reason why they didn't want their concepts encoded into the technology (like aditivos-e), was actually bcause they didn't actually believe they were good enough.

---

I then had a look at the reason why they think they're not good enough, because in a few previous conversations, I had been comparing mr. motor to the feminine instinct, and I found it really funny how the US govt operates very similar to the female mindset. I started to think about it a bit further and remembered the legend that vulcan produced a new female for zeus (pandora), and she was the scourge that sunk humankind. another thought popped into my head because when I said, "not my problem" I noticed that I felt similar to some of the upper echalon females, and also to marc, jason, and russ when I said that.

I know at least for sure that one of those is a "top" -- and I've heard russ's critisim of females. what I also noticed is that laura (kyle's wife) went out of her way to say that russ is a natural pacifict -- which I thought was weird because of his other critisims of females, that I noted it. I looked into that and when I did I was able to see the whole female power structure.

I mentioned that I believe that what a person finds to be interesting and important I believe is encoded into the X and that explains raquel's feeling of emptiness, and patricia's reaction of, "what!! that's it?!" -- because they didn't gain what they thought was imporant to them. I was attractive and so they thought I had something that was interesting or preferable, but was sadly disappointed, because I see their whole perspective very different than they do. I managed to get rid of a lot of that crap that holds a person down conceptually. in short, I don't feel like I'm less than or inferior, and they thought it would have its roots in some *thing* I have or do, but it's actually the opposite -- of what I *don't* do or have which makes me feel like I'm constantly improving (I see trajectory, not position). this is world-ending for most of them, because they have such a hierarchy built up, so many of these poor girls come in already feeling like their mothers do.

---

I then had a look at the power structure and noticed that the original one, anatau/ninhursag/anu/uranus is the original one, and so all women are born after her. I then noticed something difficult to explain, which is -- imagine the INFECTED ONES vibration goes horizontally -- well, I'm kinda perpendicular to that, and so is anatau. so, what I could see is that the INFECTED ONES were attracted to earth, but eventually get stuck with these women that have at the core of even their DNA all of the core concepts of this psycho woman ninhursag. I can see that she see's herself as quite superior to the other females, and so these poor girls go out and find a dude to start their adventure with, and very often one of these dudes has some aspect of these INFECTED ONES active in their vibration, so after their first experience, she takes on his vibration.

you can imagine how much desire this creates, because always these perfect little girls get "corrupted" by these guys, and it activates in them all of these safety and security, privacy, and secrecy stuff that is so evident in the US govt. I believe that was on purpose, and I also believe that vulcan (and so therefore the aryans) designed this purposefully. I know, if I were vulcan, I would have done it that way because it's obvious what's happening here -- which is that all of these 7th ray females (genxicat) have now become a sort of group consciousness on the physical plane. the INFECTED ONES (various priesthoods) running the show have them to maintain a form of perception that is not found in most people. that's probably why the female bloodline is so important, because these females have latent in them all of the vibration needed to have a hierarchical power structure that they like, and also the capablity for astral (4d) perception.

---

OK, that's most of the context. now, if nosebook can't allow me to go with any of these women because they need their power structure to remain unmodified (ie. they don't want physical offspring), which is fine with me, too -- because, I want to create things, and I want them to be *my* concepts -- not the girls. I want the thing I create to reflect me and what's important to me, *not* what is important to the girls.

after that there was some discussion, but I hard refused to cave in to any requests to go with any girls. it's good for nosebook, because they don't have to deal with women that think like me -- instead they have the ones that vulcan created with the INFECTED ONES vibration doment.

---

just a quick thing about anatau, which is that she sees a lot like I do, which is back to that 1st ray female standpoint. I don't believe there are any full blood descendents from her anymore, as we'd notice them, being of giant stature. nosebook does *not* want a bunch of anatau-like girls running around, because that would be a disaster. getting back to 1st ray perspective *is* their destiny though, but they're going to have to find their own way there.

she looks down at all of the girls down there trying to save so many of the other girls from the horrors of life (most females see from 2nd ray perspective -- trying to make others' desire a reality, rathar than their own). you can see how a shift in female perspective of making their own desires a reality will be the big problem that nosebook will have to deal with though. hovever, I (and probably, jason, and russ) also see it this way too because as I was watching marc smash some noobs on sky terran to GM, he took the time to explain to them where they obviously are going wrong. I do the same thing, and from what I've seen jason and russ do as well, and I'm actually interested in other's seeing things from the 1st ray perspective, because that's the one that says: *everything* is a reflection of me. I am 100% responsible for reality (including the INFECTED ONES) and all of it attracted because of my own desire.

---

so after further contemplation on the subject, what this looks like to me actually is a breakaway civilisation. I mentioned the rocky balboa vs apollo as being earth vs the sun, but you could also see it as snake-bros vs the sun -- and we have a period of time where sun activity will increase, and then we'll eventually take off and go somewhere else. our leaving the planet will *not* cause a cataclysm, and nosebook will have enough capability to keep everything in order.

along the way, what it looks like is I'm also going to be the biggest demiurge, because to most people still seeing things from the piscis perspective (group think), you'll see my hyper-individuality as something that's not really productive (ultra egoism), so most people will consider that hyper-individuality is *not* for them, so they'll settle instead for more of a normal individuality which is still mostly group think (kinda like females now).

the other possibility is the other idea that I mentioned, which is that I become a species. let's say it is 2038 that is the cutoff date and after that solar output will be too much -- well, you have all of these girls that have been wanting to be with me -- which is fine, but *I* am not the manifestation of their desire. I'll be always slightly off for them because of the incompatibility I mentioned above. it is possible to make versions of me that don't have that incompatibility and will actually be the manifestation of their desire (a perfect reflection).

when that happens, I'll be a species. as a perfect reflection of them, they'll make that evolution-of-desire: need -> want -> I AM, at their own pace. nosebook gets everything they want, and so do we.

so it's settled then. I want to make something that is a reflection of me (and not of her). nosebook doesn't have to worry anymore about that problem and we can still go off and make our galaxy too. when you figure out you're only fighting against your own feminine instinct (which is why it sounds so much like mom), then you realise nobody outside of yourself can be changed to fix the problem. in the end, you *have* to follow your own desire.

### 2022-11-10 13:42 - let's see what happens

I woke up a few times last night with a terrible pain in my prostate. I've come to associate that pain to be associated with girls -- as in, when they get excited, I seem to experience that pain more often. I've also noticed it in association with high solar output. either way, it would seem to indicate that at least something is going to happen tomorrow.

I also woke up feeling a lot of girls and stuff too, but the thing is, it doesn't really have much to do with either of those. it has to do with how *vibrationally* ready (that is, how emotionally ready) we are. however, again, this isn't so much of a decision that any of us make.

for nosebook, vibrationally ready means that they have no other option than to allow it. personally, I still don't feel like nosebook is quite there yet. they still have a lot more things they can try to try and delay the inevitable. one of the interesting things that came up in the last few days a little more than usual was the idea of a breakaway civilisation.

---

one of the things that are necessary for a breakaway civilisation to be able to leave, is sufficient technology. we presently don't have it. I sent out an email to russ saying that it is possible to make enough technology to do the breakaway civilisation, buc he hasn't responded, and not a single one of my attempts to try and get anyone to talk to me on the snake-bros discord isn't really succussful. I have to come to the conclusion that they're not interested. I imagine it has to do with secrets and probably the US govt that are making that decision. I don't know what to say other than I tried to give a lot of openings, but none were taken, so that seems like a dead-end to me.

I don't really mind that's the case. this seems to be deep-rooted in the idea that they don't want me to be working on technology, and in order to prevent me from working on technology, they still believe they have more ideas. from my perspective, this doesn't seem like an issue to me, because I just keep doing what I'm doing (waiting), and either they'll figure out the technology problem theirselves or they wait until destruction is imminent. this reminds me of the scene in "the matrix" when neo is taking a long time showing off his skills in the matrix while the sentinels were eating the nebu-chad-nezzar -- cept, it's not me that's showing off... instead, it's hollywood that's showing off (irony, hehe).

if that's the situation (and I think it is), I don't really mind that they're taking so long because eventually they'll figure it out.

who knows, they may be able to completely figure out all of the technology and get everyone installed in their matrix. the the thing is, they have a bit of a growing problem that they can't solve which is me and the sun. if they want to get their technology setup and everything, that's perfectly good with me, but they have to eventually let me/us leave *or* find a way to become friends with me/us. there isn't really another way -- so no matter how it goes, they will eventually have to let me go.

I don't plan on doing the moses thing, and neither do I think it's a good idea for the pharoah to harden his heart either, but that's not my choice. I brought up the INFECTED ONES in a previous entry (they're even below there in a topic note), because whether they are actually a problem that the universe has had since the beginning or not, doesn't matter to me. the point is, they're a reflection of the universe and the easiest/fastest way toward the next improvement, which I believe is the physical plane.

I'm fairly confident that the physical plane does not exist outside of our galaxy, and that it's a tremendous expansion of perception that is actually very encticing. my goal is to sell my form of perception to the rest of the galaxy, and then to the rest of the universe.

I've already seen what kind of mind-bending changes can take place so rapidly when a whole planet sees like I do (even though many people have thir vision blurred), can you imagine how amazing that will be for an entire galaxy. so, while it may look to them like something that is starting to become an impossible situation to handle, I see it as a perfect opportunity to get out, get the sales team fired up and start to take over the universe with my form of perception.

take as long as you guys want.

---

the other way that it was looked at these last few days is to do some sort of exchange thing (because we have this firsts problem) where, for example, lyra (kyle's daughter; I really hope that's her name) would come here and rule over the pueblo fort for the first period of time, but then allie (paul's daughter) would go there and rule over the texas fort.

personally, I don't see either of this happening because nobody has even come close to trying to make any attempt to make any contact or anything. like, are they just going to pretend that we've been friends this whole time when there are so many unanswered questions? it doesn't make any sense. this is clearly not going to happen.

if I had to anticipate (myself) what I think is going to happen, I think this year is completely out. we can get together and work on figuring out the carbon stuff so that we can have enough of a shield going for when things with the girls *actually* starts to happen, but the way I see it now, the planet is ill prepared for such a massive increase in solar output. so, we're probably going to need to work on tech and stuff for the next year to be able to allow it to happen. either way anyway, that's kinda what I want anyway, because then it'll give me a little more time to meet the snake-bros and stuff.

it's not my fault they're not ready. it's possible they could be ready by next year -- but probably not. their inability to get the planet ready for such an event is not my fault. the only thing that I can do is my own stuff, so I'll probably just keep going. eventually we'll have enough technology to get off of the planet, and then we can do it wherever we go. I prefer to do it that way because otherwise we'll constantly be in conflict, and I don't want that. the easiest way to go is the [non-confrontational approach](/concepts/feminine-mind.md#2022-11-07-1402---oen), which is to just go with no action.

like I said, if they wanted to do something, there was a number of opportunities, but instead they want to hang out and show off while the sentinels rip the nebuchadnezzar to pieces (nebuchanezzar is important period of time for the aryans). I wouldn't expect much to happen, if anything. it's still not the worst possible manifestation (ie. no other choice but to allow it to happen).

### 2022-11-11 10:34 - a solar point of view

I had a bit of a revelation today when I decided to look at the situation from a solar perspective. have a look.

### 2022-11-12 01:29 - you know I may be perceived as a really big hypocrite

I just realised that I sent out a lot of emails to a lot of strong male influences of mine. it looks very strongly that I'm looking for acceptance from them, even though I described the desire for acceptance to be the unsafest form of perception because I rely on others maintaining a belief about me. I can't control others, so unsafe.

it sure does look like I'm looking for acceptance though *blushes*.

### 2022-11-12 03:08 - to all my concerned homies out there

all things can be delayed inevitably should we be having enough fun as to not need any manifestations (you know getting ready for something can be a lot of fun). the reason why I'm totally fine with my situation not changing is that I like my present situation. we all can learn to like it. it's a totally acceptable situation. when the time is finally here, which is when there is no other option than to allow it, it'll finally happen. until then, obviously it won't.

    business as usual

    worrying won't make the inevitable come any faster or slower
    it can only come when it's inevitable,
    and that's still not yet.

    the amount I worry about the inevitable
    is probably a reflection of how much self-flaggulation
    I need to perform on myself daily.

    if I've really been naughty,
    I'll worry extra hard and spend a terrible time over
    something that's completely out of my control.

    great job me. you know, someone's got to do it though.
    someone needs to worry about all of that stuff going wrong.

    a lot is on the line.
    many things could go wrong.
    it could all fall apart any moment.

    nothing to be concerneded about though.
    it's business as usual.

### 2022-11-22 13:10 - which way am I going to go?

I was just sitting out in the sun, and I was reminded of a lot of different reactions that I often felt last night when going to the bathroom (I don't feel reactions so much when I play games, which is why I like to "disconnect" from all of the reactions for a bit).

the main reaction seems to be a discussion on what or who it is that I'll pick. to me, this is a really silly question to be asking, because I have no control over it.

it's all attraction, so from my perspective, I simply keep going until I go past the "point of no return" -- meaning, that from my perspective, the attraction is so strong, that there's no other way for me to go. I don't decide anything.

therefore, from my perspective, it looks like I simply keep going for as long as I can keep going, until of course I get connected (maxine-foot-dragon). from your perspective, it'll look like I'm constantly causing trouble and refusing, but it's not that I'm refusing ... it's just that I don't really feel good about the whole situation still.

---

sure, it's true that as time has progressed, I seem to feel less and less good about the situation -- and that's normal because the situation, from my physical perspective is that nosebook is trying to figure out how to orchestrate a situation that I don't want to be in -- so, it's normal that if they're going toward unwanted, I'll feel more and more resistance.

as an example, when I worked in tuenti (or when I was with raquel), I knew I had to walk away from the situation that I was in. sure, I really liked the idea of creating a social network, but the direction that things were going was (from my perspective) becoming less and less like something that I wanted to be a part of -- so, I walk away.

because it's all attraction, there is still a manifestation out there that feels equivalent to what I thought I would feel creating tuenti -- meaning, from my perspective, I feel destined to create something that I really like -- perhaps not a social network but something even better. that's the nice thing about letting the manifestation be "all attraction" because I don't have to do anything. I already had the desire, so now I just simply wait around for it to come.

I don't mean that I just sit on my hands. I follow my instinct -- so, for example the last few times I wanted to smoke, I felt strong inspiration to do so. I mean, like the last time, I was sitting out in the sun (like today) and it came to me so clearly, it might have even been audible (cause nosebook hears and sees things that I don't -- which is why I've gotten so good at listening to that "still small voice" even without the visible or audible manifestation). sure, it's possible to receive images and feelings from other people -- but that's the secret to getting good at hearing your inner instinct -- is that when starting out, that "instinct" sounded a lot like raquel or mom (feminine-mind) -- and so I had to actually start to pay attention to what is programmed instinct, and what is actually my "higher self".

I still get that voice mixed up sometimes, and often times in hindsight, I can see that it was actually nosebook (or someone else's attraction), but the thing is, when it feels fine (no matter the source), it always works out fine.

this is what I mean when I say it's all attraction. I imagine that one day, a person will become attractive enough that whatever it is that I feel from them is good enough for me to follow up with action myself.

a good example of this was the thing where when I smoked, it felt to me like a bunch of people were trying to get me to make a move -- so I did -- and it wasn't what people expected. obviously, if it was something that someone wanted, it would have got a reaction.

I try to stay reactionary, but eventually, when attraction is strong enough, I'll make an action because it's what "feels right" -- and so I regret nothing. I acted based on what I felt right.

"but nothing came of it, so it was a failure" -- I can hear the reactions already -- but please beware of the lust for results or the need for a manifestation in order to feel good.

it's quite possible that exactly *nothing* will come of any of the actions that I make for quite a while. like this last time, the actions are not for results, but for better positioning or preparation (depending on how you want to look at it).

I really wouldn't expect anything too substantial for quite a while. you all are still *very* incompatible with me in both, how we see the world, and how we interact with each other.

you all are still quite a bit stuck in your imaginations, trying so hard to plan everything out and get everything perfect and everything -- pretending to be prometheus with all of your forethought, but I'm the guy that's all about the afterthought -- epimetheus.

I have no forethought because you guys are all so busy doing that. when I try to make an action, sometimes I think to myself what will be the result, but mostly -- my perception is not about what will happen in some ficticious scenario -- instead, I react in the moment to things that are happening around me.

in that sense, I'm neither prometheus or epimetheus -- but a whole different style of thinking altogether, which is something like the reptile brain. I react to things based on the way I feel. if it feels good, I react well, but if it doesn't feel good, I run away or fight.

while I describe that "instinct" kind of like the reptile brain -- because it is that -- what you all are not 100% capable of doing is fully conceptualising the world the way that I do. this is painfully obvious to me because you still behave very strangely. just be yourself, and let me be myself too.

to explain this, consider the orange cat that walks around in our yard. there's this funny thing that I simply cannot be myself around her(?). she is constantly aware of everything I'm doing, and if I come out the garage like I normally do, she gets ultra scared and runs away. if I try to just walk past, there's this weird presence that's similar to what I felt when I was in spain when the guys were all super conscious of what I was doing and stuff, or like jaron oftet times when I walk up the stairs.

neither the cat, jaron, or the dudes in spain are carrying on as normal. they're all hyper aware of me and and waiting to react in any moment's notice based on whatever I do.

whenever a person is hyper aware of another person, they perceive them as a threat or a danger. there's an element of unknown or danger. that hyper-awareness, happens because they do not understand me, meaning that I'm still a perceived threat.

I had to learn how to understand people so that I could be around them without being hyper-aware of them, because when I was hyper-aware of them, my left-leg locked up and doesn't move fluidly. you can tell when you catch me off-guard or you have a presence about you that I don't understand, because I'll jump and get really startled.

good luck figuring that out. like I said, from my perspective, I don't want to do something until I actually feel comfortable with it, or [it feels effortless to me](/vapidshamen.md#2022-11-20-1705---i-want-to-write) (lol).

### 2022-11-24 06:56 - why must I refuse?

there were two main reactions today which I'll summarise into one response to the question of "why must I refuse?" however, I feel like I'm repeating myself.

my main reason for refusing this is that my primary desire has nothing to do with girls at all. I want to create something -- more specifically a "social network". I've been thinking about it for quite a while and I really want to do it.

sure, it's technology that will benefit nosebook -- and they can use it all they want; I don't mind. the thing that I've learned is, "the medium is the message", which means that the technology medium that we use (compare books to TV to facebook) completely changes how we think and reason about our environment. I want to advance the idea of a "social network" so maybe I should call it a "conceptual network"... in any case, even if the worst case scenario is that the technology that I want to create never becomes a reality for me -- and let's even say that it's used instead for malicious purposes to even try and keep people from gaining xxx, it's still going to change how we think about things (many examples of this are listed in "understanding media").

therefore, my goal is not to try and figure out a way to get the "good" content in to my technology -- because all types of content will be inside of it, just like books have all kinds of different types of content. you know, sex is definitely the hottest selling factor too, so I totally don't rule out porn and other sex-related content to be the first major products that the technology disseminates. I also plan to intensely monetise it (I've been learning from the best). the whole point is, and the fun part for me, is to make the technology. for me, that's the fun part.

the major problem with girls that I've seen over and over again is that girls (and any establishment) are extremely anti-creativity when it comes to new and revolutionary ideas. in fact, I would say that many of them even resist it, because it's unknown for them, so it sounds risky or unsafe, so they always discourage the inventor from going that way. my theory on why that happens over and over again is basically one of LOA and concepts. simply put, the concepts that we're the most comfortable with are the ones that we stick with -- even if it's an abusive husband/boyfriend. this is because we resonate with those concepts, so they feel comfortable. we give importance to the things that we're familiar with.

nearly all of my life, I've found that most people do not see things like I do, and so almost all people are extremely resistant to my ideas.

just like I've paid a lot of attention on how to monetise things, I've paid a lot of attention to many inventors and different scientists and how they performed in relation to their creativity and how far outside of the conceptual paradigm they were able to go. the ones that I admire the most are newton and tesla, and mostly this is because both of them were similar to me in that they studied much more than material things, and spent considerable time on many other non-material studies like alchemy. it's true that nobody ever talks about tesla's interest in eastern teachings and philosophy, and neither does anyone talk about newton's fascination with alchemy. in both cases, I've come to learn that these guys had minds that are very similar to my own, where they perceive the conceptual with considerable clarity.

tesla and newton died virgins as well (and quite possibly da vinci as well, but I only started to pay attention to him recently) -- and I believe there is a good reason for that. women (in my opinion and a lot of sources match my conclusion) use their sexual/creative energy to create a sort of aura where only their concepts are allowed to flourish. any other concepts are considered dangerous and unsafe, so therefore inhibited because it'll upset the flow of things. I see this all the time where a mother insists that something has to go her way and stifles cretivity becuse it doesn't fit into her concept of reality. she needs things to go her way, so that things will run smoothely.. I understand her point of view, especially as a mother, but for someone like me, this is something to be avoided.

one of the things that I *greatly* regret (amongst other things), is that I was not already doing something creative before I had a girlfriend. for example, with patricia, it was most disheartening to find out that she did not want to be creative -- and with raquel, I simply didn't have enough momentum on my project before I moved in with her, so everything pretty much fell apart as soon as we were together[^2]. I believe that I the way to do this is to do the thing that abraham always says, "find your connection, and then..." -- and what they mean is, get some momentum and capacity/practise to maintain that momentum, before making any big changes -- and the obvious reason for that is, if I find a relationship *before* I get connected, then I'll be trying to use the relationship to find my connection (cause I didn't have it and wasn't practised enough in it to maintain it).

therefore, because sexual and creative energy feel pretty much the same to me (both can be considered "connection"), I can easily replace the connected part with creativity, and it's the same: find my creative output, *and then* go for the relationship -- and the reason is the same as well: if I go to the relationship before getting sufficient momentum in my creativity (or connection), then I'll be looking to the relationship to make that creativity happen. in all of my past relationships I tried to make her responsible for my connection -- and that's the number one reason why I decided that I have to become asexual. creativity and connection come first, *and then*, attracting from the postiion that I already have what I'm looking for, getting more nice things and people around me which resonate *with what I already have going*, are welcome additions.

so, that's what I did; I became asexual wanting to focus only on my creativity. as many of you know my story already, there was susana which started off the creativity thing kinda on the wrong foot right before I moved in with marcos, but I quickly recovered. once at marcos house, I doubled-down on my desire to focus on my creative output -- though, drinking complicated things for sure, especially with everyone trying to get me setup with someone.

along came andrea, and I decided, "OK, maybe this can work out" because, after all, marcos was, at that time treating me more and more like I was starting to integrate into his family (felt strongly that he was planning a multi-decade busisness relationship with me), along with the fact that marcos didn't really have much money, so he kinda needed my work output to carry him, so it's not like he was going to let his daughter sabotage his own company. I thought it could possibly work, so I became more accepting of the idea.

when it fell through, it was easy for me to walk away because at that time, he had completely turned on me as far as the creative part of it went (it was pretty clear that he would not be the way that I create a social network around ideology instead of material crap).

jori comes in after that and unfortunately it was a project that I simply wasn't all that interested in (making yet another crypto currency). to make matters worse, it's pretty obvious that I don't have any "secrets", so how can I take a project seriously when the whole thing is based around me having a "private key" that only I know, which contains all of my super duper wealth that I've gained from launching another crypto. (sarcastically) yay.

I wanted to make a *social network* -- preferrably one where ideology and new ideas can be found. I complained all the time about that project and was very dissatisfied, so it's no wonder that I decided to break a car window. you can see how similar that situation is to the present one, cept instead of a car window, it was jerrica's phone.

---

I want to not only get some momentum on both my connection, but also my creative output *before* beginning anything. since I'm pretty clearly stuck right now, this doesn't look to be changing any time soon. I realise that I'm not making any steps toward getting something creative going, cept, of course for sending out a bunch of emails -- which means that I simply don't feel comfortable doing anything. so I'm pretty stuck, and it looks like I'm not actually making progress toward my goal. but, it's all attraction, so I don't need to go anyway -- it comes to me.

it's quite possible that someone is going to react and try to put me into yet another dead-end project like the one with jori, and my refusal to do that will be obvious. I don't want to do something stupid like that. I don't want money. I want to create something that *I* want to use/play/enjoy.

the other thing that's quite possible is for someone to try and say, "well, if you do this with us ..." -- but I find that pretty hard to fathom simply because from the lack of responses that I got from the emails. that would have happened long ago. it's not like there aren't many people with lots of money that are aware of my talent. they either want to take advantage of the idea without me or, for the reasons I mentioned in the beginning, they feel unsafe/insecure about the ideas that I want to do -- which brings me right back to the topic I opened with: I see things my way, and many others do not, and in order to actually work on those things, I have to find that momentum in the thing *before* beginning anything.

I must refuse until I'm creatively up to speed. that really could be quite a while (hence why I repeat myself over and over and over about it going to be a while).

---

the nice thing is, like I demonstrated with attacking jerrica's phone, is that nosebook has the capability to make a manifestation happen if they wanted (so they obviously don't want to). that's kinda a good thing though, because if they did force it, it would be disastrous because I don't really want to be forced into a relationship without being creative. my dissatisfaction would continue to rise up higher and higher until more things get broken.

therefore, in this sense, nosebook is on my side in keeping the girls away from my, but also against me because they don't want me to be creative either. they neither want my creative or sexual energy to begin flowing.

therfore (again), because they want me to be stuck, this is entirely a game of attraction now. I attract based on how I feel, so I have to find a way to not allow my dissatisfaction to continue to rise up to the point where I break things. I have to continually find ways to feel good and go in the direction that *I* want to go. as you can probably see, I still have a ways to go before I'm getting there.

I'm nowhere near having the mental stability[^1] nor the creative aspect that I want to have, still all over the place, quite easily influenced by nosebook and others. I still have a long way to go.

---

oh, another reaction that I just remembered is that there were a number of ideas around refusing being similar to orgasm, in that the guy is supposed try and hold and hold out for as long as possible (you don't want to just go on first opportunity, right?).

while that is a valid interpretation, that's *not* my reasoning. if this were sex and I were holding out because I feel so good, that means I'm trying to hold back the manifestation because I want it to feel even better than it already does. I can see how you guys may think that this manifestation is one already feels really good I'm holding out for it to feel even better, but this is clearly not the case. the manifestation (in its present form) feels absolutely terrible to me -- so this is not at my situation at all. like I mentioned, it's like raquel or tuenti where it's a great idea, but the implemention is not at all going in a direction which feels good to me so I have to walk away. do you believe I enjoy not being able to talk to anyone about anything on my mind? do you think that I like everything being a secret? in general, I mostly feel hatred and anger toward you guys. why can't you all just talk plainly?

it's going to be interesting to see what happens with my email to mom, because she can't really hide from me by not responding. she will eventually have to respond. it's probably not going to be the only email I send her either, as I have many more ideas to get out in the open as well... so, I guess this is the way we'll see how well my "relationship" with you all develops... yay, I guess.

[1]: add that conversation with mom about babbage and my mental stability as a prerequisite to creative output to the list of connections leading up to attacking jerrica's phone.

[2]: with both of them, I wanted to be working on something creative already[^3], however in the past, whenever involved with something creatively, I passed on girls thinking them to be entirely a distraction from my creativity, so I figured if I wanted a girlfriend, I should probably wait until I was not doing something creative, so my mind would be on her instead of what I'm creating. boy was I wrong about that...

[3]: technically, I was working on unhosted, around the time of patricia, and we were sorta kinda starting to work on a social network, but for some reason I couldn't ever get myself to work on the project like I actually knew where it was going. with tuenti, I had a pretty well-formed concept of what I wanted to create (it was facebook + essemmbly, pretty much), but with unhosted, indices and searching was difficult, so I couldn't do anything except display static data. all of tuenti was built around my idea of making the website dynamic and interactive (without needing to relead the page), but the encryption requirement totally sidelined all of those dreams of making an interactive communal space of *like-minded*, ideologically similar, individuals (the essembly inspiration).

### 2022-11-29 15:49 - lost in translation (the first)

I like to read  into things. yesterday, a sequence of events happened which... before I go on, I'd like to say that some people really enjoy "synchronicities", but these are often case from the perspective of afterthought (epimetheus) -- meaning, that the synchros are often perceived *after* the event. for me, I have these sorts of symbolic premonitions, where exceptionally symbolic things happen, and they're almost always the precursor to a manifestation of similar symbolic quality. these are almost always perceived from the perspective of forethought (prometheus). I'd like to talk about yesterday's symbols from the promethian perspective.

---

one of the sequences of yesterday where I was talking about being safe. in front of walmart, I decided to be a "bad boy" and cross the turn lane without waiting for the walking sign -- or, if my memory serves me, there wasn't a walking signal and I decided to wait for the next walking signal to wait for it. I remembered along the way that if there isn't a signal, then I will just pretend there is a signal and wait for it. before my "bad boy" moment, I walked up to a signal (in front of the cinema) and I was waiting quite a while for the signal. because I was so stoned and now the human trail (instead of walking through the field), I'm receptive to a lot of other people's emotions.

I flashed back to the movie "lost in translation" and bill murrey is depressed in the movie, so he's extra sensitive to the feeling others have around you (if you've been depressed, you know what I mean), and additionally, he's in another country where nobody "gets him" so he's really alone and isolated feeling. the film capitalises on this by taking seemingly slow or mundane situations and drawing them out to absurdities by extending them.

as such was my experence waiting for the walking signal in front of the cinema. films, especially if you have a good editor, do not want too many scenees with silence or little action, cause you'll get bored -- but bill (hope he's OK calling him by his first name) takes this to an extreme. in all of his films I've seen, like will farrel taking off his shirt, his signature move is awkward silence.

the awkwardness of the silence prepares you for a humerous interaction to be funny, rather than weird. it's absolutely brilliant, and a long time ago (especially around chris), I shamelessly ripped off his awkward silience feeling. I used to project it out, because almost always, the next thing that I do after that is funny. it's just an emotional formula to put me in the right mood for something awkward and humourous to occur.

yesterday, when waiting for the walking signal, I pulled out that old technique for the first time in years. I can't remember the last time that I emitted the awkward silence feeling, so it's been a while. any other recent examples are something that has happened naturally, as that's pretty well integrated into my personality now. I mean emit that feeling *on purpose* because I'm pretending something like an actor. after that, I felt like an actor and so when I got to the waliking signal in front of walmart I had decided that I wanted to pretend there is signal at the next moment, in effort to practise that "I'm not really sure what to do" feeling.

I get a ways down the road and now I'm at another intersection, but the right-turn island didn't have a walking signal, so I "pretended" to push the button (it was just a signal of an action and didn't at all look like I was pressing a button because the idea is still in conceptual phase for me). I waited for a little bit seening if I can emit awkward silence, and then feeling people's reactions to it while I'm pretending to wait for a signal. it was fun.

I finally went across after a while just to get the red walking signal on the next side (I didn't plan it, just felt like time to walk) and then waited another intersection signal cycle for the walk sign. I get across and there's a walking signal to cross the freeway offramp. it's a right turn, so they have to wait and look anyway so a walking signal doesn't even make any sense. I press the signal, wait a cycle, start to question myself. another cycle, question if I pressed the button. I was trying to focus on the "I don't know what to do" feeling and awkward silence, so I think it was the third cycle when I finally said "f-it I'm going anyway" and proceeded to walk down the offramp and onto the freeway.

I was really proud of myself because I executed perfectly. I knew the signal wasn't working but I played along all the way. I saw the not working signal some distance before I got there, so my subconscious (conceptual mind) knew about it, so I just kept emitting the proper feelings for the moment.

the whole event was a perfect joke that I didn't really execute *physically* very well. when waiting for the invisible walking signal, I forgot to look at the signal while waiting for it. I also forgot to pretend there is a button there and all of the other things that mimes do so well. however, conceptually and emotionally, it was perfect. you guys probably couldn't tell I was acting because I was just emitting feelings and my body follows.

obviously, my body isn't well practised in seeing things that aren't there, so it's still hard for me to see something (physical) that I can't actually see. for me, when I see it, I'll believe it. since I can't see it, I'm not good at pretending it's there.

---

OK, that's the story; so now, let's look at the symbols when I get back...

### 2022-11-29 16:30 - lost in translation (the second)

because of all the weird reactions after coming from territory-dawg back a litle bit, there was quite a strange and awkward silence as I was integrating back into this world. what was happening was happening on a symbolic level. this is nosebook saying, "don't go this way" "this way is the wrong way" "the editors and narrators don't like this because it doesn't fit into the story" sort of thing. this happens a lot to me, and so my default behaviour is to, instead of always going the "wrong" way (cause that's what I do, until I decide to go the "right" way), I was demonstrating my ability to pivot between going the "right way" and the "wrong way". I normally go the wrong way, cause that's how I'm programmed, and I think it's actually part of some of our DNA to do things the "wrong" way. I'm a demiurge too.

however, I couldn't maximise novelty if I only went either the right or the wrong way exclusively, so I jump between the two. sometimes, I want to be really righteous and do things the "right way" (even when others are doing them wrong), and other times, I'd rather smoke another joint and carry on pontificating -- inotherwords, I'd rather feel good.

ahem, so my aversion to go nosebook's way of maximum resistance was obviously not the case. I see things in terms of resistance. the guy just before was the one that I refused to leave, deciding to smoke anyway because that was my path of least resistance. I knew nothing would happen and it'll be fine so I didn't push against him. in this case, I wanted to go smoke again more than I wanted to confront someone. if he wanted to talk with me about my pontifications, I'll take a listener, but if he doesn't want to do what I'm doing, I'll go another way. I know what I want to do and getting to it is the path of least resistance.

OK, let's say that I wanted to get home and he was in the way. he's in front of what I want, so he has to be moved aside. I wasn't wanting to go home, so walking back to the tires sounded fine to me. how's that?

---

back on track here... earlier when I went to smoke after buying, I smoked over by the waterfall, but I was notably *not* on his property-- like I was quite close to the stream. next time I'm going to sit on the rock by the stream actually, and smoke there. when I left I said I liked the lights (makes it feel less scary), and left.

sitting in front of the guy's lighted tent, I started to think about how sometimes I go the "wrong" way and other times I don't. this moment in front of his tent is what began my inquiry into why sometimes I want to be right (like with him) and other times I want to feel good. it was then that I noticed that *usually* I don't care about feeling good and would prefer to be right.

after getting rocks out of my shoes and smoking I walked down to this awkward interaction in front of the cinema. for me, this sequence is symbolic of the editors/narrators saying don't go this way (we don't know how to write this), and so instead of proving myself, I just lightly go the "right way" and because of it I'm highly rewarded. I had such a flood of new information and ideas last night, I'm forever changed. nobody can tell what just happened. nobody can see what I see, and I know that everyone else saw something entirely different, so there's this awkward silence because nobody is quite sure how to be "normal" after that.

I made the comment that I felt like the waiting for the walking signal scenes were straight out of a bill murrey movie. like I said previously, it felt epic to me because I was returning back to that "actor" thing that I did when I was around chris.

chris sees from the perspective of the 7th ray. he *is* a 7th ray. I see mostly from the 1st ray perspective. when I get around other 7th rays that I'm compatible with, they give me 7th ray capabilities, and one of those is to use my conceptual powers to manipulate the situation how I want it to feel (te acuerdas de eso pierre? -- whom also sees primarily from the 7th as well). I don't normally "act" in the sense of emitting an emotion. I'm mostly reactionary (this is typical for a 1st ray)

and so symcbolically, what happenened is, I try to go the "wrong way" but one of the dawgs prevents me (territory this time). you can imagine them sorta like the demons of solomon, but they're kinda like the demons of the feminine mind. they have to defend their nest, you know... LOA does not exist for the dawgs. these are things like responsibility(-dawg) which exert more power than LOA even. in every case, all of these dawgs are social and cultural interactions designed to affect behaviour. none of them are helpful.

I symbolically passed on engaging with the dawgso (ie skipped stupid social/cultural behaviour modification techniques), carried on going my own way, went back and in front of the other guy I wanted to be right about, I was given the fire of prometheus. I saw that the desire to be right (el belief) is our promethian nature.

you know, once you understand something, you can never go back to seeing its primitive nature again, and so I know I'm not at all the same. nobody else knows what happened, people can sense something is different but they don't know how to respond. awkward silence. that reminds me of "lost in translation". I started to experience what it feels like to act again -- or, maybe I remembered it.

I decide I want to be a "bad boy". I notice an opportunity to begin to work on a routine. I can feel the narrators saying that they can write in some of these sorts of bill murry scenes. I get the flash of the next walking signal.

I practise my acting first with an invisible signal, not worrying too much about he physicality of it, focusing only on emitting the proper responses to having to wait a really long time for a signal. finally, after some times waiting for the final signal (of which I know is fake), I decide to to go the "wrong way" on to the expressway.

### 2022-12-04 19:28 - one demiurge to look out for...

imagine for a moment that in this extra light cycle that I wait for before going the wrong way, I'm getting to know other men, and perhaps even in an naked sort of way -- right, so you can imagine that some of the girls seeing things through my perspective will see some of these guys as I see them. she can be the excuse that he needs to finally believe in himself. he (or she) doesn't need to figure it out for himself. this trains them to believe they need a muse to make their reality come to manifest.

all forms that don't live up to these muses' ideal form (as perceived by these men), are perceived as inferior, and so they serve as the unwanted aspect of human female's conceptual framework (what it means to be a good girl/mother/grandmother). choose your demiurge wisely :)

#### 2022-12-04 19:41 - followup

as you can see that females serve to try and stabilise everything. they're highly introspective and the female consciousnes behaves as a a sort of 3rd ray modeling framework where the most successful things are copied and expanded on. nobody feels all that original because they're all compatible with the most successful thing (or so they think). females (in my experience) have been completely unable to bypass my attraction. the way that I perceive "women in general" (the feminine-mind), this is what I then manifest as "egregores" (I hate using that term because all of us are egregores, some powerfully one concept, and others a mix of concepts), and these causes me to question my own conceptualisation (perception) of the concept.

a conceptualisation is an archtecture kind of like a pyramid, in that I have things which "prove" things to me. these are phenomenon that I believe happen, but I don't have necessarily a good reason for them. the less I can understand them, the more I attract them, to realise I attract them, so that I become conscious of my "self" that is doing the attraction. it's OK if you feel like you are many people at first, but/and you can define your "self" any conceptual way you see fit. I respond to these situations like this. the other one is one of the perception of ideolog. we group up around others that we feel right about things with. this is a crutch because it prevents one from making a decision for what I want to define as the things I'm "right" about. this framework is best approached, but I can imagine that teams of people will define what they're "right" about in opposition to other ideological/scientific idea about an implementation of mentation, so different people live in different realities slighly different from the purely harmonious one. each of these realities is preprogrammed to accept othmr realities as "right" one can imagine that some of those realities are unsuccessful and others quite successful. in that way, one can learn (statistically) what is "right" through a series of success parameters and fitness functions. nobody will be able to debate what is in fact thme right way once all possiblities of "right" (ie knowledge of the continuous spectrum), do we not "know ourselves" as a species.

### now, conceptually (after this)

that was the symbolic look at it. now the next really interesting way to look it is from the conceptual/relational (5/2). there were many connections

### another way to look at it
- since, see the whole universe as a reflection of myself -- including the evil
- if you then imagine the INFECTED ONES are also a reflection of the universe, then we can picture the whole ordeal as similar to a story

mr azkath is tricky, you know... it has extra data encoded. I will be listening to your reactions...

### what are the things I want to be right about?

### 2022-12-09 16:53 - I just realised what this is all about...

I want to teach anyone who is listening about the universe. you want it to be easy, by looking at the cute girls. the idea here is that my new way of looking at things will be a lot easier to learn from cute girls -- and I won't give you all that excuse (satisfaction). I insist that you all begin to make sense of your reality *without* the cute girls as a distraction. I want you to be *real*. I want to continue to make the physical realm even more HD. I don't mind so much I'm stuck in physical, so I decided I'd start being right about what I want. if I have to use only the physical and don't have an imagination -- no problem, but I'm goin the tech route. I'm going to build out an entire system based around feeling and concept. it's far superior to anything imaginary and calculatory. it's better than a computer, but still *physical* -- and I'm right about it too. is it hard is it to actually try and begin to learn how the universe works.

I'll let you all in on a secret. I'm not super whatever... all of that legends and prophecies and all that other nonsense is put there by time traveling symbolic thieves, trying to take away (steal) your authenticity by prophesying in the past. these prophets get great noteriety because one can "feel" when one is right; and so, when the prophet is somewhat right, they could really feel it back in those days. I think things were more energetically different then.

these guys are always trying to make me look unsomething by explaining/predicting/whatever me so that they can give the narrative of what it is I am.

well, from this perspective:

- I've done this before (many times)
- no sweat
- I'm doing just fine and there's actually nothing going wrong
- it's not my problem
- lol, wheee

in more defined terms, I'm definitely someone who can navigate time and space consciously. I seem to have a pretty good idea of what everything around me is happening in a desire, symbolic, and conceptual standpoint. my physical is quite lacking, but it's OK, because physical is a conjugate of conteptual. I'm still figureing out "who I am" to some degree. you know, I don't raelly have mine very well defined. I'm kinda anyone to anyone. I explained this the other day as shapeshifter from physical or desire perspective. from that perspective, I am desire. in kenny's perspective, it's like he has ideas of who he is still. he could be anything.

### 2022-12-24 14:22 - the way I see the manifestation presently

1. I want to create the social network thing that I've been working on for quite a while.
  - there are a lot of symbols "foretelling" of such an event, like "silicon valley" and the scarlet woman which a communication rides on top of her
  - there is a lot of effort to try and prevent me from such a thing
  - even if I have similar symbols to tesla, there is the part where tesla becomes very sick and he has his father promise that if he gets better, he study engineering.
  - even the symbols in "as you like it" have this idea where orlando and adam decide to embark on a journey together with only adam's savings to carry them. (I see that as the "angel" investment for my idea)
  - in don quixote, panza embarks on a mission with don quixote, and don teaches panza to see things the way he does. well, if I consider myself don quixote and the strange way that I see the world which eveyrone is trying to cure me from is the capacity to see and understand the conceptual realm. if I'm teaching panza to see things like I do, that's part philosophical, but in my mind, this is the social network that I want to make which concepts can be transmitted and received
  - I know from LOA that everything that I desire will eventually come about, so it feels pretty destined to happen. you might say it's my "destiny" (ref: jason)

2. I offered that instead of a "sacrifice", [I presented a more suitable idea](/nance-notes.md#2022-12-22-1406---a-midsummers-night-dream-take-two), which I said that instead of making a sacrifice, what we do instead is just arrange the symbols in such a way that if they want to come up with a better manifestation ("better" from my perspective), then the symbols can be aborted by redefinining the symbols to something that's more attractive.
  - the sense that I got, is that this is the way that they want to go, but they don't want me involved in the symbol creation process (good luck with that one, lol).
  - therefore, I find it pretty reasonable to say that they absolutely don't want me working on any social networks or anything like that, and they don't want me knowing that they've aborted the symbols.

3. after that, yesterday, I was in one of those half-conscious states where I talk with them in a partial lucid dream without visuals, and it seemed like the way to abort the idea was to get me to go with allie (the neighbour) and I would play the role of helena and mars. I would meet bert as helena, and instead of creating a social network, the story will instead about how helena transforms bert, which is very reminescent of rocky. we'll go up against the sun (apollo) and eventually lose, but everyone wins because *love!* (ref: lindsay).
  - an alternate to this set of symbols that I heard too is that somehow kyle swoops in the middle and makes it possible to work on the conceptal network (I need a name for it -- I'll think on it).

4. combine all of those symbols together and what I see is eerily similar (symbolically) to the book of revelation. what happens is, the serpent of old (that's me) is cast down by the saviour figure that will make it possible for humankind to evade the disaster (the solar peak).
  - the way I think they're doing it is they're working on a sort of heavily controlled reality.
    - most of this is my idea, so since I have solutions and they don't want me doing them (captain-3d)
    - the moon is 6th ray, pluto is 4th ray, and charon is 2nd ray. the moon arleady regulates the astral, so the other two will regulate the other two major mediums (the spectral 4th ray) and the (???? 2nd ray).
      - each of those 3 touch all of the 4 primary/odd rays, so it's a completely control all of reality.
      - 2nd ray inputs desire from people and also solar rays and outputs all of what we call reality. 2nd ray sees the "manual for how the universe works -solar edition", so it sees that desire playing out in 3d space (through the 6th). this is just a really really good internal model for how the universe works, kinda like tesla and myself have.
      - the 4th ray keeps everything balanced (and stuff), by seeing things from other people's perspcetives (this is one of the things I want to integrate into the narrative, so that others can actually see it like I do -- and this 4th ray narrative is made possible by my 5th ray conceptual network).
      - the 6th does everything it alrady does.
  - this reality however, is not expanding. it feels very strongly to me that my galaxy idea is way too big of a problem, because it would reveal so many of their secrets so I feel like they want to keep everything constricted (ahriman) and contained to this earth.
    - my idea for the galaxy, is allowing the planet (earth) to expand to become the size more like a galaxy (it'll need to keep expanding as energies rise again). this is an idea of expansion, and it'll dramatically reduce tension.
    - instead, they want to fight earth's desire to expand (the reason for major geological unheaval, such as the end of the last ice age) and try to keep the planet it's size (with the moon setup that I mentiond above).
    - I figure the duration that they'll be able to keep that up, will be for as long as a major solar cycle (which I think is about 1ky). it looks to me like solar output will intensify contiually, and thuogh it is possible to keep the planet contained its size, I don't think it'll last forever. they're trying to mess with the planet's "destiny".
    - they have another problem too, which is that the planet itself (likely the star inside of it) is outputting more and more as well, and because this is a 1st ray, it'll intensify. the charon/2nd ray aspect of the moon will significantly smoothe this over, so this next part may not be necessary.
      - as such, from time to time, we need to push the ball of hydrogen in the middle of our planet out one of the poles to release this energy. as we on the planet continue to produce desire, the star in the centre of the planet will gain in size, density, and attractivness until she (1st ray) is let out into the greater area around our planet (which is now like a galaxy, so more like a bubble with a earth nucleation point)
  - as such, I feel like in the greater picture we're heading toward a decision point where some of us decide to go one (symbolic) way vs another.
    - some will choose to go the way that I want to go, and others will choose to abort the symbols cause they have a better idea of what they want to do. both are equally valid realities, and so therefore will exist simultaneously.

5. in the "as you like it" play, the end of the play is where they lose physicality and become "sans teeth" (ie without carnal desires). therefore, this is the alchemical purification process being played out here where we're actually stripping ourselves of the desire that it is to stay in 3d. my writing captain-3d is important, because I like 3d. I want to make 3d better.
  - the other night I was thinking about what it would be like to begin to see things as outside of time. I could see from the 4th(?) ray perspective, where you can imagine a giant gloing ball with all of these spikes coming out of it that wiggle around (like how I imagine ball lightning would look), and these all come from a centre very luminous origin point. each of the tendrils represents a "timeline" (a ionised path where more energy flows, so it's not a black and white thing, but a sharp gradient). I could walk around it, there were like control panels and things and in that moment, I could essentially remove myself from time and go to that space, interact with others there, and then reinsert myself into the timeline at roughly the same place I left off. that night, I could have made my transition to see that.
    - others were encouraging me to come, but that state of mind is easy and no progress. 3d for me is easy and there is tons of progress. I chided them a bit because they exist in a place where they neither grow or change, and insert theirselves into the timeline into the compatible body that they want to gain xp and lvl up their char -- so why would I want to go there? you get max xp the more "real" the experience, and the more you learn from it. so, I want to be in 3d, not there (as such, this is part of the origin of captain-3d idea).
  - I really like 3d and I kinda like it. I don't know that I want to try and remove my carnal nature -- maybe not the best way of saying it -- so I'll go back to explaining with LOA.
    - I'm not interested in getting "perfected" and making my transition into the conceptual where I begin to lose my connection to the world of change. I like change -- in fact I like it so much, it's what I'm constantly doing. one who seriously considerers himself to be on the path of max novelty (like myself), has to come to terms with actually liking both 3 dimensions and also change. these are fundamental aspects. I fully embody them. as such, I am a captain-of-3d.
    - as such, it looks to me like my "destiny" may be slightly misplaced, and instead what it looks like I'm really here to do is to "make 3d better (again)"

---

I think I'll end here. there is more I wanted to say, so I'll leave with this final thought. today, I was telling greg that sometimes I simply cannot understand him. I don't listen to words a whole lot, getting the majority of the conversation from them conceptually, and I just listen to their voice (like the whale's carrier signal), and so then by focusing on their voice, like they are, I can access their concepts.

it's quite likely that greg's aura is encrypted because I'm so good at picking up others' concepts. therefore, his concepts are unintelligible or planinly wrong to me. so, if you want to hide your concepts, fine, but why not present the concepts your speaking so that people like me and jaron can understand you?

### 2022-12-27 12:20 - don't worry about me

this is a concept that I woke up with yesterday morning with, and it continued until last night. the gist is that I'm requesting to be bolted into 3d, as I feel that it's always my goal to accept, become OK, and then to begin liking and flourishing in my present conditions (another aspecet of the 2nd ray perspective, orlando) -- so the reaction comes with the sense that kenny is going to to be stuck in an inferior perspective on reality meanwhile all the others are having a glorious time in many more dimensions than 3.

you have to understand my perspective, which is that of the hare. I go really fast, but my weakness is turning around and comparing myself to the position of others. as such, I've stadily removed all of my competitive and comparative spirit out of myself. I compare and measure frequently, but it's from a pure logical (3rd) perspective, and I ensure that the comparison does not produce a feeling response, which is what competition is. I'm not out to compare myself to anyone. I have things that I want, and though others will benefit from them, it doesn't matter to me. I'm not in competition with them, so I none of that matters. what matters is that I want it, and that's it.

I don't compare myself to others and have a constant sense of unbound improvement, expansion and progress, (spenta mainu), so my present circumstances don't really matter to me too much, as 3d is just the starting point. it will improve. I could see when I was writing the captain-of-3d document that I would take a technologcal/machine approach to it, and although all of the screens are flat, the first major improvement is to have many screens -- kinda like a fly. remember that one movie, "the fly"? something like that but less gross and unsightly. I often wondered what is the shape of the cells in the fly's eyes that allow them to see so many perspectives. when I've jumped into the perspective of the fly, it feels perfectly normal not dizzing at all to see so many perspectives. in fact, it's quite interesting because the fly's eyes create a sort of vacancy in the centre of the spatial image (the angle of diffrent  eye cells perspectives provide depth and that space in the centre of the image). it's hard to explain, but more perspectives mean more data.

we see the model of what our brain thinks is reality, so even if I *only* see physical but have more than one perspective, either biologically (as in my eyes gain facets), or technologically, the result is that the image has depth. in addition not all of the perspectives need to be of the same thing, so it would be hypothetically possible to perceive various flat (physical) perspectives from various bodies as well. I don't see any problem with bolting myself into 3d. I have solutions, which mainly involve looking at the same thing from more perspectives.

who knows, my 3d form of perception may become even desirable once the bugs are worked out -- who knows.

### 2023-01-06 16:47 - saviour vs attraction

yesterday, I got stuck in a weird thing where I was trying to play coi, but the songs that seriah was playing were making it especially difficult to do so.

the main symbol that stuck with me was the false dinosaurs/giants offering me a saviour, meanwhile the real dinosaurs are offering me a clever little girl, presumably located from a system that has 2 million lines of code (which is a lot of code). I presumed that this is a reference to nosebook, as it's pretty likely that velociraptors *do* run the network.

along the way to discovering these symbols, I was trying to look up lyrics for a song that has a loop in it, which says that regression causes/becomes aggression and aggression causes/becomces regression. this self-reinforcing loop is pretty easy to see in my life, because I want to move forward, but there are a lot of interests in me staying put. when I'm stuck, I'm sorta passive and apathetic, but when I'm being regressed, I become very angry and aggressive. the song also suggests that I should "rely on my reputation" for things to become effortless and also let others plan my adventures now for me.

so here's the thing, it's my reputation that makes people treat me differently than everyone else. I can never go back to being treated like a normal person, and I know that. I have to just accept that my reputation precedes me at this point. so, I kinda need to start thinking and behaving like a celebrity does -- meaning, I need to start relying on my reputation for things to become effortless. I still choose to use my perception for things to become effortless, but from the perspective of the outsider, I think it's a lot easier to accept that I have all of these things happen to me, *not* because of my perception, but because of my reputation. I'm just another snobby celebrity now that can get what they want because of the name and image they've made for therselves.

I do perceive the idea of relying on my reputation as regression and don't really want to do that, but I suppose I'm willing to do it because, like acting I think I can do it better. remember when I used to hate the idea of acting, thinking it to be disingenuous to behave different than I felt? well obviously I found a way to do acting better. I think it's the same way with using my reputation. no big deal.

so, along the way to trying to find the lyrics to this regression song, I was searcrhing for lyrics about reputation, and my body just sorta clicked somehow on a link which brought me to lyrics on a taylor swift song about reputation...

    End Game (featuring Ed Sheeren & Future)
    Written by: Ed Sheeran, Max Martin, Nayvadius Wilburn & Taylor Swift

    I wanna be your end game
    I wanna be your first string
    I wanna be your A-Team (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
    I wanna be your end game, end game

    Big reputation, big reputation
    Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
    And you heard about me, ooh
    I got some big enemies (Yeah)
    Big reputation, big reputation
    Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)
    And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
    You like the bad ones, too

    You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
    We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
    I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)
    I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
    I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)
    I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (What they like)
    You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type (You my type)
    You hold me down and I protect you with my life

    I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
    Just another ex-love you don’t wanna see
    I don’t wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
    Like the other girls do
    I don’t wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
    Drinking on a beach with you all over me
    I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
    But I ain't tryna play

    I wanna be your end game (End game)
    I wanna be your first string (First string)
    I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
    I wanna be your end game, end game

    Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
    Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
    Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
    The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
    Even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long
    And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
    For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
    For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
    I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
    After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
    I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
    With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

    I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
    Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
    I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
    Like the other girls do
    I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
    Drinking on a beach with you all over me
    I know what they all say, yeah
    But I ain't tryna play

    I wanna be your end game (End game)
    I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
    I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
    I wanna be your end game, end game

    Big reputation, big reputation
    Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
    And you heard about me, ooh
    I got some big enemies
    Hey, big reputation, big reputation
    Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
    And I heard about you, ooh
    You like the bad ones, too

    I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
    And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
    Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
    I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
    And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
    It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
    You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
    So here's the truth from my red lips

    I wanna be your end game (End game)
    I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)
    I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)
    I wanna be your end game, end game
    I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)
    I wanna be your first string (First string)
    I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
    I wanna be your end game, end game

when that happened, I immediately recognised this as being a copy of one of the stories that seriah told about not being able to figure out which game he wanted to play, but then his hand just clicked on the play button for a game about the astral realm and different secret societies and other esoteric things (don't remember all that he said about it).. anyway, the point of the story was that he said, "OK, I guess I'm playing this" and then really liked it, claiming it to be one of the best games he's ever played.

so, I mean it looks like I should just follow my instinct and stuff and go in that direction...

---

the other symbol that this one contrasts to is the one of the false dinosaurs -- which is asking if I want a saviour or not. I don't really. I'm perfectly fine doing things how I am doing -- but, like I was saying in the captain's log, I have roughly 2 months or so before mom wants me to move out -- and though I do believe it is a bit of a bluff on her/their part, I do kinda want to start going my own way. I'd like to figure it out myself. I want to figure out how to make my own network.

as I mentioned in the clog, coi in its present instantiation pretty closely mirrors my own perception of how to manage tech teams back in 2006 when I wanted to make my first network. all of the machines/actors were separate entities, not really having much communication or coordination between them. because of such a lack of intra-communication, it took quite a bit of time to notice there was a failure somewhere and it was only after a huge dip in the server graphs before the failure was even detected (this doesn't even come close to talking about all of the intra-personal relations on the team that mirrored these disconnects).

you see, when I was in spain, mom was very upset with me because I refused to go to see amorina's birth and be there for melissa. this was an enormous problem for mom which [I wrote about in metal-lucifer](/metal-lucifer.md#2023-01-03-1855---weird-interaction) (though it happened as a result of listening to seriah and playing coi -- see how everything is connected?). my perspective at the time is that I want to make a social network, and mom sees that I'm out drinking with my friends instead of doing the important stuff like being there for my family, but in my eyes, I'm team-building z-dawg style. these after-work drinking sessions were where we brainstormed new ideas and had fun with each other. I already had the CTO position taken from me because of the car accident and having to be in basque country instead of madrid where all the action is. it's pretty easy to see how in my simple brain, spending more time in basque country with mom means yet another lost opportunity to do what I want to do.

I've rethought a lot of how I see the whole factory integrating with each other and working together a lot over the years, and it's a pretty interesting way to see how all of these different parts work together as a sort of choreographed dance with each other, and ultimately, the dancers don't need to be directly involved with each other, but because there is a rhythm or clock cycle that holds everyone in unison, the whole piece flows together. it's stability of tradition (in the form of constancy -- another thing dani drilled into my head that I need to be successful) which keeps the group cohesive and flowing together (otherwise, like a microprocessor, it's a cascading disaster of misaligned timings).

as such, I've thought quite a lot on all of this and I have a lot of solutions. they don't want to use tesla technology, no problem. I've got a crude oil to hydrogen power setup, etc. I don't see any reason to push through their resistance in a forceful way. converting crude to hydrogen isn't ideal but it's still an improvement on what we're doing. we can turn oil into a CO2 heavy thing to only water as output zero emissions setup -- and obviously, I'm sure there are probably technologies that can be done to further optimise the separation of hydrogon from carbon/graphite (which is then used to cleanly smelt copper/iron/steel). I mean, it's not hard; let's just work with what we have.

also, for example, right now I'm burning my trash -- but when I was younger I envisioned this "waste sorting facility" which emitted a frequency of a base element, and then would vibrate all elements of that kind, suspending them in the air and separating them from the rest of the waste -- so like if there were copper and tin (bronze) and the frequency (created by a mechanical resonatory) was at the copper frequency, it would vibrate all of the copper separating and suspending it, leaving the tin behind. this is the most optimal form of recycling waste, because the gasses (HNO) would separate from the base elements, breaking all waste down to their elemental forms. this is also a technology I think is not only possible but very feasible. nobody can argue with the desire to return our landfills back to nature and mass clean our air and other existant waste problems (not to mention preventing future ones). seems like a no-brainer to me, as all the required technology exists.

cept, if we're levitating base elements, it seems like now it seems possible with a bit of infrastructure to have hoverboards and other really cool stuff. let's figure out how to improve the waste sorting facility to do *all* the elements :)

so here's the thing: from my perspective, I'm not interested in having a saviour. I would never have written any of the clogs in the way that I did, as a way to advertise my desire to create new communication mediums -- but it felt pretty necessary to explain the symbols that I was receiving from seriah's music. for me, this was a reaction more than self-promotion.

from my perspective, I'm completely happy to continue on how I am going and just keep playing the game and stuff. the thing is, the other reaction is that I have to start coming up with money now because mom wants me out.

I had three ideas for how to make money (other than applying for a job). the first one was to ask thad to help me to find a job. I felt like this was too saviour-esque. I'd probably rather to just go and do it myself, as I've got to take full responsibility for any future conflicts that may happen with customer interactions[^1]. I'll probably go myself to look for a job as a last resort.

the second way I could see doing it is to start streaming. I know that JD streams even without a camera, so that means that it's quite possible with a very minimal setup (I have neither camera or microphone), to get started. my name on twich is "vapid_shamen" so I'll be playing coi and talking about shamanistic and vapid things as my gimmick -- I would imagine.

well, I have this other thing that I just started doing which is to put up my save games, so maybe I could put a paypal donate button there -- but the thing I want to do is to talk about philosophy. jason never responded to me, so that door closed, which is fine because I don't need him to talk about philosophy. coi is a *perfect* game to do it on, because nearly everything about it has a direct correspondence to something mental. before I put up a donate button, I want to test to see if others want my philosophy, or if they just want to see my savegames. thanks to seriah and some resin, I kinda felt forced to go the philosophy route because the reactions and desire for me to talk about some of the things in my head were too much.

the third option that I have for finding ways to make money was also a reaction to seriah and his music -- but I can't honestly remember now the song or circumstances -- which is to, prostitute myself. this idea of prostituting myself is in the original symbols I received from neuoticfish, which includes "mechanic of the sequence" (my identity and main theme of the clog) and also "hate me" the general symbol that I use and feel in response to you guys[^2]. so, it seems pretty obvious to me to begin to prostitute myself.

the idea here is that I have something that I want to do (make a social network), but I don't believe I'll ever be able to get any "angel" investor to invest in the idea. neither do I want to be responsible to them. I have something that others want (my genetics), and they have something that I want (money), so I'll do an exchange. I have no interest in doing anything the "right" way -- and from my perspective, I can make spreadsheets now, direct a team, do marketing and promotion, and all of the CEO tasks -- and I want to do it myself. so, it seems like a no-brainer for me to say, "OK, I'm not going to try and get anyone to do anything to save me" and instead I'll figure it out and do it all myself.

in the case that I decide to do it all myself, nosebook, I'm sure will have less and less influence over me, so their only option will be to influence those around me (ie the team). this is an interesting challenge to me because I tell people all the time that it's about tuning, *not* control -- so I'll have to figure out how to tune myself and the team toward what's desired, instead of trying to control them. I'll have to come up with novel ways to organise and choreograph the machines/players in the factory (rathar than control) to produce what is wanted. it's a very interesting challenge.

---

the major problem with the last option and also the taylor option is that my body isn't really all that great at stuff. I mean, it's a real dificulty to even do simple things like pee, so how can I even pretend to be a prostitute, when the thing I'm selling isn't even very good; I'm not one of those sales guys that can sell ice to penguins.

as such, I think I'm going to to probably just retreat from the philosophy angle of things and just get back to pure coi save games because that seems to be working well[^3]. I'm not going to delete my philosophy (keeping it only constrained to here), but it'll get buried in there after I restructure the repo and talk exclusively about my thoughts on the game (only).

[1]: I manifest people's desires/fears/expections pretty quickly, and [the last episode with greg](/metal-lucifer.md#2023-01-03-1855---weird-interaction) tells me that seemingly I also can inspire others to feel things that I do not even feel myself, but are emotions that had simply recognised in others. so, for example, imagine I see some people in a store having a big argument, and unlike matt, I recognise the conflict for whatever it is (like some kind of insecuirity or threating of superiority) and I recognise it -- well, that emotion doesn't bother me because I don't see it as a problem, but I'm not resonating like that and so now I'm attractive to people that may have a similar insecurity and they want to come over now and interact with me (like greg), and I'm just going to be a reflection of their emotion/concepts back to them. this could be problematic and may very well create conflicts.

[2]: I put out some of the most ridiculous stuff and somehow I can't seem to get rid of you guys.. "why don't you hate me?" I don't treat you well. I treat you with aggression and contempt, yet you continue to like me. I'm the abusive boyfriend that you keep wanting around.

[3]: like thijs, why try to branch out into something different when I've found something that has such a positive result? I pay a lot of attention and learn a lot from other streamers, and it's especially relevant now bwecause I'm going to start relying on my reputation.

### 2023-01-13 17:43 - the skakesperean revelation

last night was a sort of romantic collapse of the notion of romantasism (I still want to know more about quixote, because I know that's what he did), and it happened with the realisation that so much of the romantic love was disgusting toilet humour.

after that, I took to thinking about shakespere, because what I noticed behind all of the disgusting toilet humour is a bunch of symbols. in the play, hamlet, there is pole-land, and danmark. this is referring to the land (similar to where antartica is now, and forms a triad with egypt and antartica).

I started to understand the reason for the pole-land, because the earth wants to point her pole toward the sun. the south pole would be the most obvious choice for pointing at the sun, but that would make a very even cycles, and so not preferrable. the other thing I noticed when I was exploring the concept of the inner earth. I could see that the earth is shaped like something and I counted 8 or 12 (my counting isn't very good when things are still as blurry as they are), and I also didn't realise I was looking at only one side of it, so in reality I was probably seeing 8-12 (avg 10) points at a time. zolting another idea more on it later (this is different than "seeing"), I noticed I was probably looking at an icosahedron, a water shape. if the original world system was based on a tetrahedron (fire), that does seem like it would be a pretty unstable planet. so anyway, there are these nodes, and they have triangle shapes to them so probably equilateral triangles. what I do know is that a square is 4, and 5 is icosahedron (5 eqitris around a point), which is pretty cool because it's why everything goes in 5's.

at any rate, the different points around this icosahedron all pertain to points on the earth. these are the "nodes" and they have structures in place to keep things stable. anyway, the world can do this wierd "shift" as the 5's move from "top" to "bottom" (or back). around the equator of all shapes, it has a rhythm, and so there will be two tops and one bottom. then, there will be two bottoms and a top (of the verticies on the icosahedron, lol). when this shift happens, there is great geological upheaval. anyway I postulate that another pole-land will appear, and so what I'm thinking is that probably egypt is one point and another in a point at antarctica, then there's probably another on a third point -- well I'm describing a "vision", but the words are coming out like "it is" when that's just because that's how I read concepts, and so it gets routed through the knowing section. "it is" they appear to me. anyway, in the vision, the third point was in austrailia. this is "poland" in hamlet. then, denmark is danmark -- ie the neophonecian "pirates", the "network state".

OK, so if we're pointed directly at the sun, then behind us is the moon, pluto, and charon, and a wholo galaxy of micro planets/moons/resorts/etc. the earth will then have a glow in its atmosphere from the increasing solar output. it'll look like flames creaping up from the edge of the earth, and if anyone looks beyond it they'll be in direct contact with the sun, so it'd be like really bad(?) for them. to them, because of the super light barrier can be led to believe that it's a flat earth. in addition to that, it's my estimation that the earth will start to emit *A LOT* of energy on the equator. it can be focused to make a sort of plasma wall; an artificial barrier; an "edge of the world". this is the "underworld" and saturn will rule the underworld. they might find out the constellation of life existing out in the colonised space beyond.

---

I don't think I captured the whole bit of the concept, so I'd also like to note that there were additions to the concept in the front -- like before going off to make pole-land and my new sort of conceptual collective/medium in which we all join each other in conceptually similar ways. in addition to that, I'll probably merge with the girls. the saturnian underworld is going to go a whole different way with it, which I personally would really like to be apart of, if it were actually the ideals that I would want for the system (not some disabled counterfiet inferior setup). right, like from my perspective, it's a super great thing that I would totally be joining in myself, and I love the idea of giving ideas and my thoughts on the thing (anatau hangs out with vulcan a lot).

the next thing that is not totally resolved conceptually is that I've mentioned that I would feel fine in a female body. this sparked some interest because they thought it would be really interesting to see my personality in female physiology/architecture. it would change, but I imagine I would just be completely unstoppable. I learn really really quick and I'm not afraid to fail and adapt. I also like to talk my way out and in to stuff, and I'm pretty much my own best friend. I wish there were others like me. because if I wish/desire for more of others like me, I'm creating more of others like me that I can talk to and interact and expand my consciousness. I'm basically "using" you all to get friends.

so, anyway, I noticed that there was a lot of desire to see what I would look like and behave in female form. even I am kinda curious myself. I would be so voracious, it would be insane. so anyway, I don't know when I want to do that, but as we start to sorta "become one flesh" they will all start getting used to seeing the world the way I see it, which is that it's no problem to take a little bit longer, when you're staring down the barrel of living for eternity. there's no need to rush anything at all, you know. we'll literally be around, forever.

novelty seekers love to be around, forever because there's always something new and exciting to impress me. I have no idea how exactly it works (theories developing), but somehow the universe is *always* able to conceive an even more wanted thing in the face of not getting wanted. what you get is the wisdom to be able to move over to wanted, and so that's the programming or "nature" that you come with. we started out thinking that violence and power structures are the way to get what's wanted. I think those are sorta encoded into our DNA, the reptilian fight or flight sense, that compulses us to move without thinking. this instinct is can tuned based on our perception of reality, so therfore, I've found that the real evolution is not so much scientific,but we're sort of like fuzzing and performance optimising human instinct.

by modifying our instinct, we're building a syntax of interactions to get what's wanted. this is somewhat of a shaky foundation to it because later, what if later on in a future culture it's not considered polite to lick someone's butthole before you get them a sandwich -- so you know, you gatta watch out for that stuff.

anyway, beyond that hypothetical reality, what we're really doing on a macro scale is getting better at tuning -- that is we're getting ready for full-scale passage through time at one's lesure.

I feel like there's more. too bee continuededd

### 2023-02-14 15:28 - going the "wrong way"

yesterday, there were a number of events that happened. one noteable one was that I was approaching the interesection with the "wrong way" on to the freeway. as I approached it, I thought about doing the thing where I practised the acting thing where I press the wrong way button. I didn't really feel like it though. instead, I decided to go the "right way" on to the freeway (which is where I shouldn't be going anyway, right?).

as I took extra long to get to the intersection where I would go the "right way" on to the freeway, I remembered seriah and his complaining about having all these road troubles. I forget who, but someone made the point that if he just would have gone the freeway, he wouldn't have had all of those problems. I remembered that and decided that I wouldn't "go the throughway" (he didn't say freeway). so I didn't, either.

walking up past health solutions, I noticed that I was approaching the bus that was giving away free vaccines. I remembered the rest of his story where he didn't have a vaccine card cause it was on his other phone. I'm looking right at the bus, which I noticed on the way down to nuevue with the slogan, "ready for a comeback? / get a vatcine now" (or something like that). I paused and stood in front of it thinking for a moment about the idea cause I don't really need/want a comeback, because I don't really feel like I'm losing. I also haven't really had any resistance to a vaccine either (nor any real need to get because I don't fear getting COVID). I thought about it a second and I didn't really feel much resistance to the idea. there was another woman named jessica, with, I think, the same birthdate as jaron (cept born 88). jessica seemed significant, but for some reason I can't really place where that seemed significant (maybe it was a dream? or shakespere? -- not sure).

anyway, the guy asks me how many shots I want and I fumble around to get the phone to try and figure out how many to get using the randomix app, cause I gave all my change to the woman earlier on, so I didn't have a coin to flip. the guy is looking at me like I have no idea how to use a phone or something and he suggests that I put the picture of the vaccine card on my phone. I can't remember how to use the camera, but then it came to me in a flash. this reminded me again of seriah's story about the card on his phone (which didn't really matter cause security barely even looked at it and either/both could have been faked). I tell the guy I'm not really using my phone for years and I'm not really integrated into society (which are all kinda true -- but the thoughts shortened for brevity).

as he's explaining the that there are multiple shots I can get, I'm actually thinking now that I don't want to just get one vaccine, but both, *and* also the flu shot. I was reminded of how I had all of them as a kid, and also there was [an idea a while back where I would take hazardous viruses to build up my immunity to some harmful mutagens and also pioneer new upgrades for humans](/stephan-schwartz.md#2022-08-10-0732---internal-chatter-and-the-uber-man) because I don't really think I'm going to have anything bad happen to me.

I then get the vaccine and sit in the sun for a while with an overwheling sensation, that now "I'm one of them" (normal vaccinated human) and it feels like I'm now kinda approved by the general populous that I'm OK to be with others now. everything feels fine and I haven't had anything negative happen but a bit of a sore arm. however, all day yesterday and this morning I noticed that I'm now tuned to a bunch more people (I'm on vaccine frequency now). it seems there are a lot of girls that have the same vaccine too and I feel them. this morning when I wake up I also feel a whole bunch of reactions from some tech bros that are now looking at my body's stats -- something they didn't previously have access to apparently, probably because nosebook probably doesn't release that kind of data. I don't really care (obviously), and have even petitioned to make my body's data *publically* available (including my DNA) for study and well -- all things trans-humanist.

quickly (because I feel some reactions): what I think is happening is that nosebook has the most data of everyone, but bill gates and a number of other tech ventures have a similar setup to nosebook deployed with the vaccine, which is a tesla-like system is being used to record vibrations inside of the body, which can be used for all kinds of introspection into the body: everything from thoughts to blood pressure and other chemical reactions -- and I've even said it's possible to use such a system to sequence a person's DNA as well, as the vibration will be a reflection of the DNA and each nuclear folding the cell takes on. I don't really mind that tech companies can see my stats, honestly, and there are quite a lot of possiblities that can be done. (I know this is very conditional and not effortless)

the other major reaction that I was having is now that nosebook no longer has a monopoly on the internal stats of my body, things maybe a little bit different now for me. I don't really know -- though, I also predicted that the new battlefield is not going to happen inside of the person's head/body. upon realising this, I remembered that bertram was heading off to war. this is probably the new "war" of biological warfare (it's hard to explain the new/extra set of reactions now). also, as I plan on getting the other vaccines, as well as the flu shot, I'll get the full set of biological warfare arsenal.

all in all, I clearly went the "wrong way" by also going the "right way" (not going the throughway).

I also did another thing today which is also the "wrong way": which is, instead of holding all of my ideas on the programming project I want to do (ChAsm) and telling the girls directly when we get there, I decided instead to [talk about it early](TODO-link). this will, almost certainly, abort the idea -- as, I've found that if I think about something too much it comes out wrong or the timing gets off; essentially, whatever I'm thinking about gets aborted. this happens, I believe, because others are also hearing my thoughts, so they already know what I'm going to say/do before I say/do it. therefore, I have to just act/do things without thinking about them.

a good example of things getting aborted, is actually here  writing this -- as, if I think too much about what I'm going to write, it gets aborted -- which is why I think about the topic, sometimes 5-20 times before writing it, making sure it's sufficiently pre-aborted and the thought comes out nicer when I write it. quickly: this is also why often times the sentence seems to go, then all of a sudden there are a bunch of missing words or I jump halfway though the sentence to another thing -- and it's because in my perspective there was a semi-steady stream of thoughts, but homo-correctus working over at nosebook seems to kind of cut out sections they don't like or something, cause when I reread it, *I* know what I'm writing about, but the words are completely unintelligible, meaning concept was unable to get expressed properly in words. I can't possibly imagine how broken/repetitive my speech is in real-life, cause -- if it's anything like writing this, it's probably a mess.

therefore, I expect the abortion of my programming project to be no different: my strategy is to just keep aborting it until it becomes eventually, completely unavoidable.

another thing I realised yesterday [after writing about circles and dots](/sepehr-thoughts.md#2023-02-13-0818---circle-and-dot) is that if I actually want to make a galaxy, I'm going to need to either import stars into it from this galaxy, *OR*, we're going to need to make our own stars. therefore, it's probably a good idea if the more dots than circles reflective types (usually female gendered, I noticed) are actually quite powerful attractors. inotherwords: my idea is probably ahead of its time. however I don't mind if it falls though because it'll happen eventually, so it's not really a problem.

the final thing I want to mention is that I noticed that the (some reactions are calling it) "five-fold path" and that I also called the "individual's journey" apparently is quite useful in creating a lot of interesting stories and narratives -- so, at the very least, I'm just a stage magician (kind of like a puppet now that I'm vaccinated) while the real magicians (ie the media industry) setup their automation of the human race into narratives. which means, however that the five-fold path is going to sort of be unavoidable for everyone (eventually).

in tandem with the last idea, I noticed that the tatoos of the woman and also of the man from the vaccine were all 4-fold and symmetrical. I know that I've been talking about things from a 5T (centre of the universe/story/play) perspective, the 4-fold symmetry makes it seem like they want to perhaps try and restrict me into 4, *for right now*.

like I said: it's probably ahead of its time.

btw, be my valentine?[^1][^2]

[1]: this is, of course a reference to "two gentlemen of verona", where valentine [gives up what he's been talking up so much](/nance-notes.md#2023-01-31-0042---two-gentlemen-of-verona) (silvia/silver) to his best friend proteus. I'm essentially calling myself proteus/prototype, and the symbolism could be taken a number of different ways, but I take it to mean giving up what you *deserve* ([or reward](/nance-notes.md#2023-02-08-1748---deserve-is-a-false-reflection)).

[2]: I don't actually know why I wrote it. it was a thought that popped into my head, so I just went for it. it didn't mean anything to me at the time (other than identifying myself with proteus). the above message[^1] is a refelction on the concept that I had just now regarding the connection between silver/silvia and the casket in "merchant of venice"...

### 2023-02-18 10:25 - what role do I play & resume of yesterday

yesterday, I started out by reading the "[whore of babylon](https://bradfilippone.wordpress.com/2012/08/08/the-whore-of-babylon-introduction/)" play by thomas dekker. it caught my attention, and anyway I hadn't discovered that more comprehensive blog there (written 08-08-2012) and started with [a less comprehensible text](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A20092.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext). at any rate, the work is hard for me to try and imagine all of the characters into my head, so I just read the dialogue as if it's a continuous story cause I can't really make a distinction between who is saying what because all of the characters look the same in my mind: black. therefore, because it appears to me as if it's an essay and also I noticed that most of the playwrights are all trying to make a point within the dialogue, they're all saying the same thing, but from different perspectives on the same scene.

it was only *watching* mwow that I had ever coprehended a play in a sequential form; it's hard to explain how different it is for me to read/hear it than to see it -- something that prospero wants mira to do instead of visualising the story he's telling her. anyway, the play has this strange sense to it and I'm identifying with the titania. so, while she's called thei fairy queen, she's called "titan." by the playwright and the sense that I get is a bit different.

now, the day before that I was [watching a charlie rose interview with cameron on his film titanic](/string-board.md#2023-02-17-0359---followup-fairy-tales-and-the-titanic) (ie titania). I identify with james cameron in that I also produce an emotional experience with the technology medium that I'm given. I also mentioned how I see these sorts of emotional experiences as bridging gaps in time, where we can reconnect with the emotion of a disaster and reinterpret the emotion through new eyes -- which in that case, is a glorious romantic relationship, that never became what it could be because of a set of unlikely circumstances -- which, my personal opinion of this is, the discomfort of losing rose (and her diadem) to a hotshot gambler was too much for her wealthy suitor to handle, and so it was his tremendous emotional dissatisfaction with the turn of events which manifested the *unlikely* set of events to transpire.

like I mentioned, I see myself much more in rose than I do in jack (even though my father's name is jack). after that, laying on the ground, I was playing with the idea that perhaps sofia (the author of "lost in translation") may perhaps be more similar to bill's character than I am -- which would make me more like scarlett's character. for some reason, I wanted to read the "whore of bablylon" play, which she's also called the "scarlett woman" -- which unfortunately again I identify more with titania than with anyone else.

I'm like technology that humans manifest to make a difficult part in time or space to become more understandable and easier to manipulate. notably, I also include speech, art expression, and language into this description of technology, as well (along with all the science and physics stuff). therefore, like art, fashion, language, and all forms of technology, I'm designed to obsolete myself, by enabling *understanding*. in addition to this, I perceive things now from a [2nd ray "glutton for punishment" perspective now](/kyle-notes.md#2023-02-12-0342---the-2nd-ray-glutton-for-punishment-perspective) which is [a bit different than the saturnian perspective](/thoughts-from-the-throne.md#2023-02-17-1157---the-saturnian-constant-frequency), and so for me, I choose not to have the "best" or the most optimal manifestation all the time, as I also like the titanic, am doomed to fail. there are *always* going to be perspectives that don't allow a manifestation to happen, and so life is kind of like a series of "lessons" (cause they lessen in effort and time) where we essentially sabotage ourselves with our own beliefs, like "too good to be true" or "I'm not good enough" (see the saturnian rant there for more examples) and that attracts a reality that reflects our belief system.

therefore, you have to see me as the titanic that will inevitably sink, because none of use (not even me) can ever possibly believe that something so magnificent could e-ver happen to us. that's the saturnian mantra produced by these playwrights. because I've recognised this pattern all of my life, I've gotten better at going with the "worst" manifestation -- because it's all perceptual, and even the "worst" manifestation, is still quite wanted (just look at how tuenti propelled me into this future), and I would *never* e-ver want to change some of these significant "points of no return" in my life. I can't go back to who I was before the brain haemorrhage, or the tuenti pre-prostitute or any of that. it's sunk to the bottom of the ocean, and to try and exhume the corpse from the bottom of the sea would break the emotional power that symbol can be transformed into the next thing.

life is a bit like falling down an endless flight of stairs (for me anyway), and so one's perspective of that journey that determines how we see the stairs. my stairs are a reflection of me, and I like that there's always something new to be desired, instead of regret that my "best" manifestation is falling down from its pedestal.

#### 2023-02-18 11:25 - followup: what role do I play?

so, as I'm reading the "whore of bablylon" play, I'm combining ideas from the "lost in translation" idea of sophia having 2 days with a person in tokyo, and what sort of things that she would want me to do if that were to happen, and I'm putting the pieces together here and this idea kinda comes to me where what if I were a sort of prostitute in the sense that people gave me something in exchange to spend some time with me. they can do whatever they want, right, so then it becomes a question of what then would they do. there are a lot of nuances to this idea that I probably won't express all in one go here, but -- imagine that there are many people offering to spend time with me...

first of all, how would I pick? for me, it's an intuitive thing. some people feel more attractive to me than others do, and I can't really quantify it, however I've been wanting to produce a website that organises and helps to get like-minded people together, so to me it sounds like the-problem-is-the-solution, where I can imagine finding a number of different ways to find commonality and difference with another person -- and then upon seeing a person's ideology enumerated, I rapidly get a "sense" of a person, and then intuition kicks right in and I know exactly whom I would want to spend time with -- so that's kind of like a good starting point for me there.

that is only one idea of quite a few others that I have, and I'm fairly certain that some people are interested in making other ideas that I've had (and will have) a reality -- and so one of the things that I've wanted to do for a while is a sort "co-op" (in the basque sense -- acquired from anaje) where we would all do stuff together, the structure is very flat, and those actually doing work receive more benefits than traditional top-down company/corporate hierarchy. I have many more ideas on how to do a number of other things from a bottom-up (receptive) perspective, btw.

so the idea that came to me on how I could implement that. I'll tell it from multiple different perspectives: I talked about the idea of "being my valentine" and so if one were to look at this from the parent's perspective, this would be giving up the reflection of them (their daughter), and so imagine for a moment that some amount of money (or something valuable) like fenton offers anne (a sort of dowry) and that whatever has a sort of arrangement or agreement associated with it (like a marriage), so that goes into my bottom-up system as an investment. in a sense, that dowry is paying so that I can purchase/own her -- and then whenever she's ready (like the lobsters) to get thrown back out to sea, I'll disown her, give her inheritance, and she's off on her own -- and, like the prodigal sonne, she's always welcome to return.

---

this morning I woke up to a series of dreams which got me thinking now about my "role" in all of this... if I'm perceived as a sort of king, I'm placing myself into bertram's role -- which is going to happen because, like bert's marriage to helena, he doesn't want to be in that position anymore. now, he wants to go to war and be a man and stuff. bert is the next evolution to paris, who woo'd menelaus' wife, helen -- however [compared to hector (who's doing all the real work), paris is shining his really shiny armour and avoiding battle](https://youtu.be/ITWj2BN9REs?list=PLIlatssdqY5Ny9xspJqRg9jthBzafAf_l&t=708). bertram is now looking really good in comparison to paris cause he wants go out and do real work, instead of staying at him with helena doting on him.

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/DNYi27BH54A)

for me, the idea of being perceived like a king would be like returning back to my position as paris. I don't want to be a super cool CTO and sit in on meetings and just be the pretty (CTO) [figurehead on a ship of fools](https://youtu.be/DNYi27BH54A?t=64) -- instead, I'd prefer hector's position risking my life out on the battlefield covered with filth and gore, doing actual work, than to be sitting around polishing my really shiny armour.

you see, paris is a character that doesn't want to be an actor. he's set in his ways (at lesst up to book 10, anyway) and doesn't really want to be an actor. bert is an actor: he's repeating all the stuff that parolles is putting out, so he's a sort of actor... now, when I was thinking about prostituting myself out, before I got to the idea of looking at the lobsters like the prodigal sun receiving his inheritance before the father's death, I was was thinking about the idea of meeting sofia herself in tokyo and, so then she would essentially put me through a number of situations (dunno if it would be filmed or not), where like bill's character, it's just to sort of see how I react in strange situations. well -- what if we were to extend that all the way to maverick and ice-man "top gun" type situations as well, where tom cruise comes in shouts at me for a bit and then I just reflect his emotion back to him from my "now" point of understanding/perception. the saturnian ideas there are tremendous, because once my kundalini has risen, people all over the planet will feel my perception of tom's emotion, and also strongly feel my reflection back to him as well. in situations like "thrill seeking" and other macho comeptitive stuff, this would be like a roller-coaster for humankind. *lots* of interesting experiments to be made there.

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/sPqnxFgCrhg)

OK, but what if, instead of looking at myself as a king (gold) or an actor (lead), I see myself as a pure reflector (silver), and instead I'm basically a little girl's robot for a while. I'm a "trooper" and will just go around and do whatever work she wants done. I'm a reflection of her desire.

I'm still working out how I could see the 4T (foil), and 5T (centre of the universe/play/story) roles still..

### 2023-02-25 17:05 - love's labour lost

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/HEBOBqBjjYI)

today has been a bit of a slow day for me because I watched the first half (up to intermission) of that production. there are a lot of things that are really problematic about the imagery in there, however if one gets past that, there are a lot of really intresting aspects about the play. I'm just about to start reading it (cause it's going to give a very different impression), however one of the strong senses that I had watching it is around the homoerotic imagery in shakespere's plays. it's not like I'm the one who wrote it, right -- I'm just laughing at the jokes, just as I've been taught by adam sandler in his movies to find those things humorous... lol. to counter, I think a lot of the images were reversed, and a lot of the rose images get turned to mean female body parts, instead of males -- however cheekes are cheekes and lips are lips, so how they're juxtaposed with the rose, *is* important to shakespere (for some reason).

anyway, there's part with some images in there about a rose and a knife kutting: stab stab, stab -- and so as I was laying down, I was thinking about those images. shakespere also puts a lot of emphasis on hymen (as in the god of marriage in twelfth night) as well, as a sign of chastity and virginity... well, the problem here is that this play completely goes against the others in the image that it gives -- instead of it being seen as a virtue and desirable to have a hyman, in this play, the image is quite graphic and bloody of a knife piercing and stabbing her.

I thought about the image for a while last night and I realised that this is connected to a whole lot of "holding on to pain" feelings that I've felt, especially from mom when I've commented that I think that childbirth can be a pleasurable experience. well, the same can be said here: a girl doesn't *need* to have a hymen when she starts her sexual experience, just so that she can prove to her lover that she is, in fact, a virgin. I would assume that there's a way to release the tension there gradually, and it doesn't have to a terrible and bloody ordeal. I mean, what on earth do I know though...

anyway, as I was exploring the image a bit further, I was reminded of this tearing or prickly sensation that I would feel from raquel when upon first entry. it felt very similar to the image, and I wondered if girls sort of relive that original pain at the beginning of every future experience (which she obviously will forget if the experience is pleasurable after that) -- cause I mean, if so -- my goodness -- that then, is yet another way to associate men with both pain and pleasure. I understand that men were brutes in the past, but then again it seems to me like women in general sort of hold on to and identify theirselves with this pain. I read a little bit more into the romance novelist "renee jones" from [miyara rose](/nikki-ana-jones.md#2023-02-24-1413---miyara-rose-episode) and the [planetary gridworker's romance](/nikki-ana-jones.md#2023-02-24-1449---planetary-gridworker-romance), and the sense is that she (renee) have these dark fantasies and stuff where they actually like some element of pain and the men to be somewhat brutish.

I don't really want anything to do with any of that.

besides that stuff, if you read all of the stuff I've written about recently about the charactor, actor, reflector, foil, and centre -- this play accurately (it seems so far) to depect a sort of recipe for a charactor to become a centre, and for an actor to become a foil. the process is all about going through the reflection phase in the middle there -- which means becoming more receptive -- and there are *tons* of jokes about that in the play (especially from the masculine receptive images).

the thrust of the play is around some men not wanting to accomplish receptivity, so because of the reflective nature of females (notice the one with the ukalele), men are sort of forced into becoming sexually receptive, because after all, the alternative is 3 years of abtention of drink and sex (if I remember correctly). essentially, the concept is -- go gay (arms or top) or find a way to release resistance (perception) and begin attracting what's wanted (legs/bottom) -- or else a sort of death of some kind.

in the play, one of the characters (forgot which), keeps asking for a remooneration (as in relocation of the moon like in taming of the shrew), but until the remooneration (which connects to the pen-rose tiling of the heart to others of similar gridwork alignment), the character is forced to enjoy "mike's pastrami" -- because, until the moon, pluto, charon remooneration, all things are based on attraction and perception.

once the emotional space (in relation to) the rose is split into three (or more) parts -- others of different configuration to you will feel really "wrong". having an artificial way to align a person to a different grid angle will allow the main narrators (the male tops) to artificially set (hopefully we'll have the option to choose) our emotional alignment to the rose, and therefore which pen-rose grid angle we're aligned to, without needing sexual interactions to acomplish the alignment.

after the remooneration, it'll be a lot easier for other guys to become a centre, and to have a lot of other reflectors/actors around them, essentially enabling the guys in the play there (forgot their names -- ferdinand and armado), to be able to get the girls that they want and have all of their desires fulfilled just like how they want in the play there (*asterisk*).

this sounds kinda like a bad thing for them (or us) to be able to artificially set our alignment, but I must reiterate myself in saying that it's all attraction and perception, no matter how wrong or awful something feels in alignment to the heart. this is essentially adding another dimension to the saturnian zero-sum system, setting the two "good" and "bad" sides on either side of the reflection. it also adds a second dimension because a charactor can become a centre and an actor a foil a whole lot easier, whereas in the old saturnian system there was a lot of punishment, earning, and paying for things to get what you want -- and now it's all about alignment to thing, allowing them to control how all aspects of the world *feels* to someone. also, both they and us can adjusted the acceleration or repulsion of us a thing -- because there are infinite paths through the pen-rose grid to the other thing, and the path that one takes produces a frequency -- the more direct, the faster, and the mor circuitous, the more nuanced it is.

in short this is probably the manifestation of the "[it's just a question of time](/concepts/hardcore-holdouts.md#2023-01-28-0724---its-just-a-question-of-time)" where I said that I see no problem with there being a saturnian steering program, as because I know that it's *all* perceptual, even if they control my speed and how many times going around thme destination before I get there, if I perceive it as wanted, it's all wanted, no matter what gridwork angle they're selecting for me.

they're not taking away any freedom from us, because we can still feel however we want to feel about anything -- just, now they're able to change how things feel *physically* to us now -- which is fine. if they can dupe me, it's just another way for me to gain more XP.

changing how something feels used to be something that the saturnian steering committee used to do with their heart -- however it was backfiring on them, because how one feels *physically* in their heart (3rd ray) isn't the same as how soneone conceptualises the same thing (5th ray). if I conceptualise different than how my heart feels (for example watching royksopp's "vision one" or "girl and the robot"), then the results doubly backfire for them. they want to have somethting more stable which can allow them (another point) to stay as far away from me perceptually as possible (which makes a line). lines are important, because they're important because they're 2d, and are the reflection which the 2nd ray perspective is built upon. why? because a point that desires to be as far as possible from another point is a line. two points that want to be as close as possible are the opposite. it looks like a infinitely dimensional (limited by your concepts) network graph of all things and how they interconnect. each entity/node is attracted to other nodes that are similar, and repulsed by things less similar. nodes are groups of points/nodes which are then groups of points. they have a shape and a structure to them which is always moving, which itself creates its attraction/repulsion identity.

### 2023-02-26 11:14 - seeing things how I want to see them (regardless of how they feel)

> "so, you're sayin' there's a chance?"

I'll watch cupid's labour lost again at a future time, cause today I'm feeling like I want to watch "titus andronicus" instead.

I should probably have also mentioned that in love's labour lost, there was a moment in the play (I don't remember when), when I realised that if I were to go toward (explained in the next part), it would be the "tragedy". OK, previously thatt day I was talking about how when I interacted with someone sexually, I noticed that it seems to interact with her father's side x-cromosome, and what it feels like happens is that her father's X is swapped out (more like strongly influenced, and the amount is determined by the strength of the experience) with whomever is her last sexual encounter (or her perception of her father, if it's her first time). in the vision that I had during the play, there was this girl and she -- was basically a younger copy of mr. motor, cause in the play there was a notably mr. motor character, however the words that were describing "him" as many motors in the background sounded, painted a picture for me of a little girl that was essentially the embodiment of him -- and that I interacted with her -- and that's what sort of spelled disaster.

one can only imagine what mr. motor wold be like if he were a woman -- and furthermore, what hme would be like if he were a girl. I "hme" looks to me like "time" -- but I don't think that mr. motor is time/saturn. I was thinking about it this morning and mr. motor feels a lot more like jeortau/alalu than anyone else. he's got this strong not-good-enoughness vibe to him -- dissatisfied with everything. he represents the "old witch" in a lot of ways to me.

now, the way that I understand the history of the human race, the "original" humans were a reflection of alalu, but those humans were too unstable cause of their fieriness, so they got adapted to water by sanatau and anatau (enki and ninhursag). therefore, the original framework for the X came from alalu (of which, I'm fairly certain were also created a derivative from the original martians). that's all of the base code going into it and also before the reversal that happened after the 7th ray (aryan[^1]) triad as maximum reflectors -- which, is the macro manifestation of the change from top-down perspective to the bottom-up perspective. when that happened, the centre and the foil switched places essentially with the charactor and actor -- and so was the original "fall".

obviously, even after the "fall" many of the previous centres and foils tried their best to continue to prove theirselves as still 2nd ray and 4th ray types (zeus and enlil are good examples), and history is full of stories of their efforts to prove to theirselves that they're still the centre or the foil -- only to be constantly thwarted by reflctions of theirselves (created/manifested by their own attraction/perception, of course). the most hardcore-holdouts were the 76 and 34 types that still tried to continue to prove their position (and dominance) as 2nd and 4th rays (respectively). now, if you could imagine a reflective world where everything you feel turns to reality, it's a very uncomfortable world for those with the 76 or 34 perspective -- mostly because the 5th ray (conceptual) perspective is completely occulted, so it looks like stuff is happening by chance, fluke, fate, or destiny (depending on how much knowledge of the physical reality rules one has attained). obviously, such a reality would be undesirable to live in -- so the opposite is created: the physical; a place where it appears that conditions are the cause for everything: a reality where conditions as a reflection of concept manifest slowly, and have to reach great amounts of power before they can actually manifest (like the end of the last ice age).

you can see then now hmow it's been a pretty epic struggle for some to try and prove theirselves that they are, in fact still a 2nd ray. mr. motor, feels to me like the most hardcore-holdout to that perspective -- as he still thinks of himself as the guy with the big picture -- and he sorta is, cause, I would imagine he's really seen the most of everything and has the longest vantage point on time, being also older than time itself. anyway.. that's the back story there..

therefore, I can imagine that up until now, there has not been a satisfactory system whereby to understand the nature of physical reality (it looked too random); that's one not-good-enoughness there. the other major one that I noticed is the base code of females. imagine for a moment that mr. motor is strongly (this isn't how it is) trying to retain identity to his Y (alalu/prometheus' original fire element), but it keeps degrading (as a reflection of his perception) -- and so in order to maintain the strength of the Y, specific breeding has to be done whereby females (having X) strengthen the Y with their perception so that the "will of the father" can be maintained and sustained -- but he *hates* the X because it feels random and unpredictable to him, so those qualities are squelched. the X (receptive) side is the other not-good-enoughness.

now, also that day, sara replied to one of my posts on youtube -- and she's quite interesting to me. I find her very attractive for some unknown reason. I read the response and didn't know what to say -- probably because she didn't know what she wanted/expected to hear back from me, so I can't tell her what she wants to hear; my 7th ray is strong so I manifest desire into physical. me thinking about her probably influenced some of the effects of the symbols, and why it *really* did seem to me as if all of cupid/Love's labour was completely thrown away. as I said, "I don't want anything to do with that". though, this morning, I had a strange idea that collectively, it's possible that this could be a sort of "fallstaff" thing where the appearance of the play is presenting an image that is affecting expectation in a negative way -- so I'm still kinda working through it (hence the title: "seeing things how I want to see them, regardless of how they feel").

the next thing that I point out is after the gridworker's romance ideas I clarified yesterday, I finally started to get the whole 30, 60, and 100 of the weeds and wheat. the wheat are those that will be running the pen-rose system, meanwhile the obvious pen-rose partitions are a triangular numbers: 3T, 6T, and 10T. these correspond to the dimensions of perception. saturnian (4th ray) perception stays right at 6T, physical stays right at 3T, and the new one appears to be a 10T system. the only problem with that is that I like 3d physical reality. I enjoy the struggle and constant challenges that physical reality creates for me. I have lots and lots of ideas on how to make plain ol' 3d reality be exactly what I want it to be.

the other day, I was watching an achievement academy presentation on george lucas and one of the things he made mention of is what it's like to go from an environment where everything is a struggle (like where I'm at now), and suddenly burst in (essentially overnight) into magnificent success and an essentially resistance-free environment. this is actually quite an interesting challenge that I myself don't really like. even after I made enormous amounts of money, I still preferred the "normal" life -- and quickly lost all of my money. I enjoy things to be difficult and challenging.

the other vision that I had during "cupid's labour lost", was one where I could see that jackson (as in jack from the titanic's son) was in fact a progeny of mr. motor, and what ended up happening after I interacted with this little girl (mr. motor in feminine form) is that the strength of the interaction she essentially retained my X, and I got mr. motor's X -- and promptly found myself in jackson's body. I guess that's one way to keep the struggle going.

I was kind of sad at this news because I could imagine that I'd really be in a bit of an emotional pickle, with a whole lot of really conflicting and awful perceptions on life that I (kenny) have figured out my way around -- and so I could imagine a bit of a struggle there, and the thing that I find really annoying is that I'm sure there will be many well-meaning females that are going to try and "help" me or be there for me -- when that's not at all what I want or need. I really dislike so much hand-holding and find it to be a really opressive way to view someone: as not good enough to do it on their own. I learn the best on my own, and it's important for me to come to my own conclusions of how I want to improve all on my own.

the vision continued with some mathamatical figures and shapes that I don't know how to describe relating to infinity -- but the essentials of the concept is that I could see that I am the "first" to have fully made that reflection, but like the prince of spain in "two gentlemen of verona", I'm getting what I deserve. when I asked "be my valentine?" I didn't really know that I was asking if you all could give up your reflection of yourself (me). I thought it maybe actually had to do with giving up their imagination, as that's kinda what I thought was the reflection -- and it's also something I encourage others (especially women) to give up, as I believe having a *visual* (76) imagination is inferior to the *conceptual* (56) imagination that I've cultivated. I *much* prefer my non-visual imagination at this point. I suspect that jackson also has a non-visual imagination too, from what I saw of him anyway. I guess we'll have to "see" what happens...

[1]: I only added this, because aryan is the only "root-race" that I really can identify for sure. it's possible that the denisovans were jeortau's fire race and the cro magnons are the martians. I don't know, as I'm not an anthropologist; I simply look at the conceptual/alchemical transformations and try to identify those in relation to the species' perception.

#### 2023-02-26 14:54 - will and the witch

the way that I see the X and Y working is like this: the X,I believe is responsible for magifying/diminishing things that we see/hear/etc (amplifies and transforms input signals) -- a reflection of the 5th ray, and so in practicality this functions as a sort of repository of preferences and interests, pointing out and noticing danger/exciting/good/bad things (essentially the tree of knowledge). the Y, on the other hand, is more synonymous with the 2nd ray (promethian/fire) perception which is how concepts relate to each other. this takes the form of will, power, rightness -- essentially all the programming of what the guy sees/knows as "right" or what "needs" to be done -- or because of how they relate, it will see things (instead of as interesting like the X), has a sense of *value* relating to conditions and concepts that should be fought over/acquired. guys then focus on rightness and will for necessary/valuable things to happen, which then adjusts their attraction so that they begin to attract more of what they're giving they value and give their attention to. in the case of these "valuable" things being unwanted (like someone unfairly paying you, injustice, etc.) over time this degrades the X to continue to attract more and more of those unwanted thing until eventually he's modified his X to really be attracted to a lot of that unwanted things this continues to degrade the X until his perception of himself is severely distorted.

that's adam, let's say -- and when he has sex with a woman, she will get her father's X nearly completely replaced with his extremely distorted X. her mother's X now has to be very strong and unchanging so as to not get pulled into her last sexual interaction's perception, and find a way to get her father's X to look more like her mother's X again so that she doesn't take on his form of perception and destroy herself and her appearance. the stronger her mother's X is, the more resiliant she is, so evolutionarily speaking, the best X programming that is least affected by the other X is the most successful. what that means in practise though is that her mother's X continues to get more and more stuck in her ways, with dangers compounding so that she notices them more and more -- meanwhile the things her father finds as attractive get noticed more as well.

the other thing that happens is that since men seem to like younger women, her father's (fair maiden) X comes to notice all the good things and begins to compliment all the stuf that he thinks is right, just, true, fair and *good* and attracts them to herself. she's at war with herself on what is perceived/seen (cause I think it literally clouds her vision) and depending on how she's feeling and a number of different factors, she'll see the things as either really desirable, or pointed out as dangerous/unwanted/bad-feeling that stuff is not reverse of interesting -- something to be rejected or avoided. obviously though, rejecting something is the same as attracting it, and because the X seems to highlight both the good and evil alike, it attracts both things more and more. over eons of time one can see that the mother's X (the witch) gets more and more set in her ways about what is noticeable and realisable -- and likewise father's X (will and wit) also gets more and more set in his ways about what is right, honourable, and just and what's perceived as valuable.

therefore, what's happening in my situation here is this: I'm valentine/cupid, and what I've done, has been to get on my own (kinda like a shepherd alone spending long hours in the field) and I've figured out my own version of X and rewritten her completely -- she's really nice and attracts what she wants: sylvia. she's probably not very compatible with other men's Y though (which I think is the leading cause of "autism", btw) -- cause, I'm fairly certain my Y has changed a bit as well. the modifications to my Y can be seen mostly as my extreme desire to remain in *reality*. my Y (base nature) has become even *more* reflective the aryan and I'm even more 7th ray in that I *really* like real and tangible; which is, a perfect compliment to anatau (the witch), which likes to stay sorta suspended in the clouds looking at everything in a very lofty way which doesn't have much to do with reality. which is, I believe the default state for all X -- cept, of course all the dangerous stuff that she's picked up from experience to avoid/reject. so, in order to bring out the loftiness without being a serious threat to my health and sanity, my Y is much less serious about reality, doesn't value a whole lot cept how I feel and likes to joke around.

sylvia though is extremely naive though because my perception (related to the Y) doesn't see many things as dangerous anymore because of how they're related, and so I would imagine that if a girl were to acquire my X, it would be a complete disaster for her, because her mom's X is pointing out all the dangerous stuff, but my X sees the danger as not a threat or even as desirable, so she'll attract these things defined by her mom as dangerous really rapidly -- to which she'll get a "told you so" (you should have listened to me, I'll protect you from those dangers) from her mother or other protective/loyal people around her. having such low resistance is great when combined with my form of perception (cupid), but for her -- I'm afraid she's going to learn the hard way to prove her mother even more right or to find a new way to look at it and upgrade her mother's programming. it probably looks unfair to others because of my XY combo, all things that I love for me are essentially effortless. this becomes personified in the masculine expression of love/desire as cupid/valentine.

romance is the art of giving the other person cues of what I desire/want/expect them to tell me, that way the other person can then tell me exactly what I want to hear from them. the better I get at implanting my interaction desire into the other person using cunning, wit, and word play, I can essentially affect whatever it is that I want others to tell me. cupid is a 1st ray by expression: whatever he wants, he gets; it just takes a well-aimed arrow.

in my case, I don't value a lot of the same things that other men do, so to *actually* get the things that I want, I've had to completeley redesign the witch to actually attract, point out, notice, and realise the things that are actually a reflection of my desire. the witch rewritten is sylvia, love/cupid's labour. they're a bit of a package deal, and while I do think that it's great that other men are trying out my genetics, for a woman, I find that my changes to her would probably be disastrous (though I don't really know because I haven't talked to bea/patricia/raquel so I don't really know how positive/disastrous it was for them -- *and* that's also REALLY OLD code, as I've come quite a distance since so the latest stuff would be far more potent in its attraction/rejection power and will very dramatically compete with her mother's even more than for bea/patricia/raquel). this is my primary reason for wanting girls to learn LOA for theirselves.

anyway, the X is related to perception, and so the stuff that looks good to us, also feels good to us -- which is really important -- because, from an inside-out perspective, we *feel ourselves* first, then that *creates the image* second (as a reflection of the feeling) -- meanwhile, an outiside-in perspective sees the *image of theirself* first which then *creates the feeling* second (as a reflection of what they see). sylvia is able to actually see herself and everything else as a reflection her own concepts (even more perfect silver reflector). this is also important because she's not feeling competition with those that aren't a reflection of the witch.

most women have this constant competition to see who can be most un-witch-like in appearance, meanwhile still maintaining the witch on the inside. as she gets older, the tiredness of life converts her more and more into the witch as she realises herself as the awful thing that will/adam expects her to be. when she's first born, she's mostly her father's X -- which is the X reflection the most valuable thing that her father wishes women were according to what they value as right, honourable, and good (and chaste): the fair maiden.

what's happened the last few days though with the pen-rose gridworker's romance is that now they're able to hijack our perception of something (which used to be a only something the X can do) and make nearly anything look attractive or repulsive to the X simply by modifying the pen-rose path it traverses on it's way to perceiving it -- which essentially means that the way something feels *physically* can no longer be relied upon, as it they can adjust it to look like anything from witch to fair maiden in attraction.

after this change, now, it's important to *perceive* things the way that you want to see them, no matter how they feel -- because, depending on how the archons want things to look and feel, now they can decide for us essentially, how everything will look and feel physically now. we're going to have to gain more and more better access to those organs that the body has which are not on the physical dimension/plane now, because those are our connection to your non-physical counterpart of 2nd ray perception the "SOLAR ANGEL"

as an example, you'll notice previously I would (upon any girl that felt good), simply decide that she's great and worthy for inclusion -- meanwhile now, my perception has changed a bit -- as I know that most of those good-feeling sensations I *physically* feel are artificially created from the saturnian guys, and so I don't really follow how things feel to me *physically* anymore and instead rely on that non-physical "knowing" that this is something that I do or don't want to involve myself into. instead of what follows my physical feeling of desires anymore, I now go for what I actually want.

what I want is a bit fuzzy though because although, I'm in the middle of a mid-life clarity, my mid-life "crisis" is actually that I don't know what I *really* want. because of my circumstances, I sort of float about reacting to everything completely unable to do my own steering. I'm 100% reliant on my perception at this point, which now after this pen-rose change will soon be what everyone is doing. I don't really have any control over going toward the things that I've wanted, and they've managed to make them even appear physically as undesirable or uninteresting now (the X). I think this lack of desire and inability to know what I really want is a part of my process of becoming entirely perception/appearance-based (ie like a charactor/centre). they perceive anything I want to create as something that would make their job of keeping me contained even more difficult. this manifestas as a threat to their superiority and stuff.

they *do not* (for whatever reason) evver to allow me to have good conditions, until it's impossible to keep it away from it -- meaning, something everyone has access to. this situation I'm in, is, I believe, a reflection of the "first and last" way of doing things: I'm perpetually in a state of struggle, because I infinitely have a bunch of guys with significantly more physical power than me constantly containing me, holding me back from being uncontrollable. they seem to want to gain (and keep) full control over me -- which is the "going infinite" thing -- so I have to figure out how to make all my manifestations not threaten their contain and to give them an easy way to expand and maintain distance.. what this looks like in practise is that I don't actually manifest something until it's a common manifestation for everyone else.

the first to get the manifestatation of my desire is the elites and that's used to further hold anyone else from getting any perceived advantage. I don't *actually* get the manifestation myself it until it's the most "normal" or "logical" thing to happen for someone in my position/conditions. it's because of who I am that has allowed their continual physical superiority over me to occur. even if the situation I'm in wern't happening, I'd still take the "everything is free", open-source collaborative sort of approach to life (because the spontaneity that happens in reality because of others is the best -- if I perceive it that way). even without my situation I *still* wouldn't try to hold a superior position to someone else -- but the drawback to this is that I'm sorta limited by everyone else because I don't get it until everyone else has access to it.

therefore, if what *physically* feels good, is controlled and artificial now, what I *really* want -- isn't so much any physically good feeling, but to actually get all of the elite stuff that I pump out available and common to everyone -- so that I can have it too. open source a tope!

so, what "valentines's labour lost" is really about is giving up my my form of perception as encoded into genetics and letting proteus (the next girl and then her future partner) have sylvia instead.  wherever sylvia ends up, will almost certainly be squandered but I think that my genetics will return more and more rapidly to reflect my form of perception, so she can always come back to get an the latest version of sylvia (the prodigal daughter?).

if she passes that code on to another man, he may find some confusion in my concepts (autism) especially in wondering why I attract some of the things I attract and amplify things that appear really awful -- but that's just cause he doesn't see "the big picture" like I do, and/or his Y values things those things differently. it could be somewhat of a problem for the the men still trying to prove theirselves and haven't embraced their reflective/receptive nature yet.

genetics aren't really much of anything, being only a reflection of the infinite eternal part of us (who you *really* are), and so at best "valentine's labour lost" is nothing more than a way to fuzz and continually improving my non-physical concept of myself (SOLAR ANGEL). when looking at the big picture, I'm a sort of counter to the witch: though I give up sylvia, she'll be back more and more rapidly each time I have to start over, and inevitably the disaster that she causes cause of inevitable incabilities will eventually transform the witch (over sufficient iterations) every human who inherits my genetics into a centre. as a bonus for me, I get the maximum XP of all, meaning that it'll be so natural for me to rebuild sylvia, that in an increasing number of situations (like a weed) it'll be effortless to rebuild her and thrive -- cause that's who I *really* am.

so, while I agree with george (lucas) in the idea of helping people -- I'm not helping people for the same reasons or the same way: I "help" people by letting them figure it out for theirselves and being an example for them to copy and improve upon theirselves -- and I hinder people (though it sometimes looks like help) by trying to make all of my creations available as as quick as possible to everyone else, so that I can have it too.

#### everyone is a centre (but, do *you* see yourself as one?)
 -> selfishness as the reason for why everything is free
 -> charactor (first) |reflection| foil (last) = centre (first and last)

### 2023-03-02 20:21 - marriage contracts

of book 11 in the "the golden ass" (which I want to begin reading), wikipedia says:

    The story concludes with the goddess, Isis, appearing to Lucius and declaring that Lucius shall rise to a prominent position in the legal profession and that he shall be appointed to the College of Pastophori ("shrine-bearer", from Ancient Greek: παστοφόρος) that he might serve the mysteries of Osiris and Isis. Lucius is so happy that he goes about freely exposing his bald head.

I want to start to avoid narrative realities, so I may not want to read this -- however the damage has already been done so I'd like to elaborate on the "prominent position in the legal profession" bit. it's not the first thing time that it came up, as there's a book mom got me called "last days of night" which also has paul in it, as a sort of lawyer for tesla. so suppose that my grandiose plans need a sort of tesla that can produce the machinery to ensure such an opposite earth can exist, and that it'll be what we want it to be (ie, the part of the spectrum that we're not). the concept of paul is an interesting one because I don't hear a lot about paul in spiritual circles -- in the airy-fairy sense, anyway -- and instead I hear most him referenced in condemnaton and a steering capacity for various ideologies. shakespere himself is notably pauline, but also a bit of a foil to paul as well. it's funny that paul is the name of the lawyer that represents tesla. anyway.

therefore, when I read shakespere, there are essentially four types of plays: ones that end in marriage/tragedy (and ones that don't). other plays, end in marriage but the marriage doesn't seem to feell like it was a desired outcome.

I don't mind going for tragedy, meaning that there's no marriage, and everything falls apart tragically. there are so many great train wrecks that if I were to match the symbols of my present situation on to those tragedies would be a pretty hilarious train wreck, I gotta tell you.

however, if we're not going for tragedy, then that means marriage. marriage is a word with a considerable amount of baggage to it. we often times perceive the ideal, yet because our reality concepts of the ideal symbols (what we really believe/expect), then every time, it creates a manifestation which will produce (after some quantity of tragedy), the perceived reality of those symbols. obviously, this is a disaster waiting to happen. our perceptions of what marriage is, and what it means is not at all realistic; even the vows themselves are not even realistic.

so, in order to begin to manifest the terrestrial reality, instead of the "ideal" reality, I'd like to consider the whole arrangement like a contract -- a contract with logic to it. I'll treat it therefore, like a computer program.

my perspective is one of infinite expansion. I don't really see it stopping. to understand this type of perception, consider emotion: when in the middle of strong emotion, the pain, pleasure, or whatever feels like forever. it's near impossible, the stronger the emotion is, the harder it is to think that it'll be anything other than forever. we know that it can be different, but when it's captivating, it's so real -- that, like a dream, it feels like forever is happening.

forever does happen, and it's unavoidable, because a reflection of those concepts will continue to manifest over and over again. consider that the vibration of things that we create today will forver bounce around inside of earth, gathering other like vibrations, resulting in a manifestation -- meaning that everyone and everything is, forever. that's an infinite loop.

in computer programming, unless there's a reason to put an iteration limit, the lopp will *always* jump back to where it started and start again. imagine this as a DAC, where the amplitude of each sample is its value, which is the result of a function with some logic in it. the sequence can be of any length -- and, within it are jumps based on various conditions. this is the exact structure of DNA, I believe.

therefore to the base marriage contract will be "while forever:" -- and so since this is an infinite loop, I'll render this into english as "we're going to be together forever, so:" -- and then there are the conditions.

though a loop is infinite, it doesn't mean that the processor will continue its vantage point inside of the loop, and can go elsewhere which either returns at a later time, or not; we'll call this, divorce.

my marriage contract with each of the reflectors will only be the "we're going to be together forever" part. that really is the only stipulation that I have, and so what that means is they get to fill in as many conditions as they want (from zero to Infinity) all the things that they want to put in and what they want to get out, as well... I guess -- or, just "for see what happens". I really don't want to complicate anything at all.

if you look at the essence of this contract, all it says, essentially is "I agree that I'm an infinite creator of my reality". obviously we all are, but I think it's good to recognise this, because now you see myself as an eternal being or infinite loop; and only I can destroy myself. I'm 100% responsible for *all* things that are happening in my experience. that's all I'm really wanting to express myself, as I can see that from out of there, I have the freedom to feel how I want to feel about whatever's manifesting in reality.

the other thing to comprehend here is that I kinda don't really want to go to reality-earth with a bunch of technology either. we'll come to find ways to get the technology that we want by finding ways to get to it (naturally). I do hope that nosebook is going to try and keep us in the stone age for as long as possible, and we'll naturally also create our own nemeses as a reflection of our own perception. I have no comprehension of what that sort of technology we'll end up with, and that's kinda the fun part is the discovery process anyway, and it'll also inevitably be whatever our nemeses are unable to block (ie whatever is attracted). so when I think of what will become of whatever it is, I don't really know how many of the traditional machines we're used to here on earth that we'll have.

whatever technology we develop will depend largely on whatever our containers feel most comfortable with trying to control -- and I don't know if that'll be mental, mechanical, or organic (or some combination of the three). it's really difficult for me to tell -- and, going by the pen-rose idea, it could be that they fashion 3 different worlds and then use us essentially to figure out those aspects for theirselves -- cause they are afterall, only able to learn and come to what they want, apparently by steering us from a superior top-down position.

in conclusion:
- I don't know what "bald head" means, but it could mean either nakedness and/or hairlessness.
- a contract (marriage or otherwise), though traditionally recognised by the state, is ultimately an agreement amongst the participants.

### 2023-03-04 09:33 - ferdinand vs bertram and proving myself

last night, I went into a pretty lengthy monologue about competitive gaming and proving oneself. in the monologue, I was talking about how it's really only from the actor and from the charactor that one has to prove theirself. the reflectors don't really need to prove theirself, because they are bound by attraction, so no matter how much effort one puts into it, one can never really prove to anyone anything other than what they're attracting from you. therfore, as as the charactor moves moves toward centre and actor towards foil, the idea of proving oneself to something outside of theirself becomes less and less relevant; which is, in fact what makes them different.

a centre knows that she is only competing with herself. the others out there are only a reflection of her perception of herself, and se she's attracting them toward her to see what she looks like (from the inside-out perspective). a foil is similar, but the difference is that the foil can *transform* the energy from one to another. ever known someone who seemingly feeds off of your negative emotion? in competitive gaming, this is "mining salt" I used to do this to my father all the time as a kid, because I could turn his displeasure and anger into something that felt good to me, so it gave me great joy to "press his buttons". likewise, sometimes I enjoyed being the foil by taking a bunch of really fake happy people down a notch in emotion (sorta debbie downer style) by pointing out all of the stuff that doesn't work about their overly optimistic perception of something.

I like foils myself, quite a bit because any time that I'm overly optimistic, I want people to try and take me down to a more realistic level. in a way, zaryn played that role for me in tuenti; though, he was more of an actor, repeating other successful people's ideas; he'd carry on endlessly with me about how doom was just around the corner because "facebook will translate" and/or we're running out of money (or whatever). his "realisim" was a huge downer to my unbounded optimism that I had for the idea of making a social network but because of my foil-like nature, his negativity fueled me to prove him wrong and actually make a profitable website, and find solutions to his problems.

there is a tendency for someone being foiled to cause them to become a charactor or an actor, by needing to prove theirself to the foil. this is what happened to me with zaryn, as I (later on), without realising it, started to need to be *right* and prove him wrong, than I just knew my own capacity and just continued to work on what I felt was the next step.

---

OK, those are the concepts needed to explain this idea. I tried to watch all of [sara's video on ferdinand's speech](https://youtu.be/nOHmEY6OZyM), but I was feeling like I was missing something with what she was saying... I went to look up the originall versions to see what it said there, and to my horror, it's considerably worse than I imagined. so anyway, it's not a thousand, but a million. that's -- ridiculous. however, besides that, there are a number of things that it inspired me to think about because I would do things a bit different than prospero is instructing ferdinand.

as I mentioned in my dream this morning, it's quite possible that ferdinand is simply the counter-point to miranda -- and I don't really want to do that. in the golden ass, the story of cupid and psyche is interesting but not at all realistic (IMO), because cupid is pure desire (1st ray), and psyche is the most beautiful woman on earth -- so, 7th ray. I'm not looking for a woman that's beatiful -- because none of that matters to me. as a centre, I see people the way I want to see them (like fallstaff). therefore ferdinand and cupid both are looking for their opposite. I'm looking for a reflection of me -- so she'll be quite normal and perhaps even a bit ugly (old witch-like) in appearance, because people who rely on their physical appearance for things are the actors/charactor types. they can rely on their appearance to get (from others) what they want. I'm not looking for those. I'm looking for centres like me which are highly attractive (not because of their appearance) and know how to narrate anything they're attracting into good-feeling places by using their perception, like me.

so anyway, I don't really identify with ferdinand at all because he's just a completely plain charactor. he agrees with everything that prospero tells him, and sounds like he's doing a whole lot of effort and hard work... I, on the other hand don't really follow everything that saturn (mr. motor?) wants all the time. I want to do things my way, and you can also imagine how difficult it is to have a conversation with a car engine. as a lawer (or someone in the legal profession), I have to have clear conversation, time to think about the ideas, create some counter ideas, and then the ability to reject his ideas. prospero even threatens ferdinand if he breaks his vows of virginity to miranda... you know, this just isn't going to happen, as everything that prospero is, is veiled behind hundreds of clearance levels and also his agreement with ferdinand is mutual-back-scratching nonsense. if you'll notice [my initial thoughts on the marriage contract](#2023-03-02-2021---marriage-contracts), I do not place any conditional requisites on any of the girls in any way. I'm unconditional, and forever.

sara also said, "sometimes we have to do something painful so that we can feel good later" (or something like that), and I don't at all jive with that idea. I like effortless, and ferdinand is just a complacant workhorse -- so again, not my thing.

finally, I'd like to mention that I'm much more like calihan and fallstaff than I'm like ferdinand. calihan and fallstaff are centres, but they're portrayed poorly because of their appearance. calihan's appearance is that of a fish (and how they smell, ref: hamlet), so naturally others want to exploit him. fallstaff's appearance is fat and greasy, so naturally (because of their expectations of what someone who looks like that would be like) he's seen as a grotesque image of their expectations. also, as a reflector, he (like me) behaves as a reflection of their expectation.

because I'm also a bit of a centre, I do tend to show up in your minds as a reflection of my appearance which is governed by prospero (nosebook). so I'm constantly fighting (is not the best word) their portrayal of me, cause you guys come to expect whatever image they display me as. I know that it's not even close to how I am, so I'm kind of like a reverse charactor and foil mixed together -- meaning that they portray me as much *better* than I really am, and then I turn your overly optimistic perception of me (venusian ideals) into 3d reality. it obviously doesn't match a lot of times and most of the time, what you all want from me is not what I'm wanting. I then have to find a way to sideline those ideals apparitions (like I'm doing here) so that the ideal (patricia) can evolve into reality (raquel). I'm *not* the guy you see when I'm asleep. that's prospero's "art", not me.

#### 2023-03-04 14:24 - if symbolically, I'm caliban...

I mentioned that symbolically I'm more similar to caliban, and then I just woke up and I have some further insight on the idea. I just [looked up sycorax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sycorax), and my suspitions were right. with connetion to the raven and crow, she's the "dark goddess" -- which, is a reflection of your perception of her. in one way looking, she's 7th ray genxicat (manifest earth) in the form of miranda here, and the other angle of reflection, she's anatau/eve (desired earth), the base instinct from which enki fashioned all females.

the essential idea here is that, sycorax/anatau is the foundation upon which all of prospero's entire setup is working: the island that he inhabits, he only inhabits because caliban is his slave. ariel is was in love with her, but because of her unrequieted love, he was pined to such an extent that prospero had to let him out (obviously homosexual), and so ariel/mars continues to serve prospero for as long as he remains enamoured with her and unable to satisfy his desire for her.

this looks to me like a continuation of the story of vulcan produces aphrodite/pandora/sycorax (-7). she hooks up with mars (+7) and that produces venus/athena (-3) which then becomes the consort of saturn. however, my brain is very confused now because miranda would then appear to be venus. anyway, in other mythologies, mars does hook up with venus (leaving the giant gash on the side?) and that produces cupid (I believe). the thory behind that is that -3 venus is the opposite of vulcan (-5+), and so if mars (+7), were also receptive (as he appears to be in the form of ariel) were to interact with venus, that would produce his opposite: (+1) cupid.

it sounds like if ariel goes away, a lot of prospero's magical capability goes away with it. the play also ends with a bit of uncertainty on whether prospero is actually going to let ariel go. I'm not sure why, but that seems important...

#### 2023-03-04 15:50 - saturn's dominion and the loss of ariel

the way that I understand it, and I could be wrong about it -- is that 6d, the medium between 3rd and 5th ray is perceived and created by humans that have reached such a dimensional height -- and I believe that's accomplished through "carnal acts", but most significantly this can be most easily accomplished through homosexual relations (ie, ariel and prospero).

it's important to note the form of perception (inside-out vs outside-in), cause I've noticed that some men (usually the bottoms) seem to have outside-in perception which is more conceptual/magical -- meanwhile other men (usually the tops) seem to have the inside-out physical/astral (34) perception.

the effect of being able to manipulate time happens because the heart is essentially your tuning into the present reality, and so prospero (which seems to be someting of a collective consciousness) can adjust timelines based on the different ways that all of the hearts of all of the homosexual relationships around the world is adjusting the trajectory. meanwhile, the ariels out there are the sort of feeling manifesters, performing a sort of magical reality creation which can then kinda bend the timeline. the higher up the prosperos can get (into 6d), the more effect they seemingly have to influence timelines to their (and others) advantage.

I think the reason why ariel is important in the tempest is because prospero doesn't *really* want to let ariel go, because that would mean that he can no longer use ariel to adjust timelines like he can now -- which in my mind is a sort of plea for a (pen-rose) technology to accomplish the same thing.

the way that he would lose ariel is if sycorax would actually not be such an awful person and pine them up like that. I've noticed this a lot from different reactions, anyway -- and from their perspective, they'd love to have little girls that actually desire them (like happens to me), but for a number of reasons, they don't think they can (mostly because prospero holds the keys to miranda and keeps reminding ariel of how awful sycorax is, so her awfulness is reinforced every sexual relation). I've explained a number of times that it's all about perception, and that these girls that they're all getting pined over are not so much the girl's problem but because they're a reflection of ariel's perception. he sees what he wants/expects/desires/fears to see.

I see girls all the time the way that I want to see her, and that's usually pretty nice. the problem then becomes when she wants to convince me that she is *not* the way that I see her, because she too has beliefs about herself, as well. fortunately for me, and unlike other guys, I don't really want to deal with her silly ideas about herself: she can figure out a way to become a reflection of me, first -- and any other belief about herself different than the way that I see her feels pretty bad to me. I've noticed that often times girls can allow theirselves to see theirselves like I see them for a short period of time, but often times once we've spent any amount of time, she begins to revert back to the way of her mother (which is usually pretty self-deprecating)...

quick aside: self-deprecating is actually a *good* thing, IMO because it means you're already beginning to see from the centre perspective (everything in my reality is my fault, because it's a reflection of me) -- however, society doesn't like self-deprecating and doesn't know how to deal with it, so we teach all of these self-deprecating types to be charactors: to (ideally) believe they are something that they do not yet know theirselves to be -- and so what happens is they learn to go around pretending to be something that they're not in the form of imitation of someone with that perceived quality (actor), or to live an illusion of oneself (charactor). if one can realise that all aspects of reality are a mix of everyone's different perception, and if it manifested, it's because my perception allowed it to manifest. if I can get to a place where I see that all reality is a reflection of me, I *only* meet people in a feeling place that matches my own.

so now, going back to ferdinand (and the idea of millaine): imagine that somehow a bunch of us got together and a bunch of girls started to realise theirselves more from the centre perspective (as in the 1000 gold aaron put under the tree), then over time, we would eventually start to gain a new form of perception: one of the centre -- and eventually those girls' X would begin to match my X in the sense of how it sees/conceptualises the world.

nobody *actually* wants girls to see the world like I do, because they would immediately become superior. I noticed this in a lot of reactions that I had to me saying that I wanted to turn into a black girl and demonstrate to everyone what it would look like for a girl to have my form of perception -- because even though (initially) my genetics wouldn't match my perception right now, it's not genetics that really matters, but who I *really* am which attracts events which catalyses a change in my physical concepts (brain) and genetics to reflect the perception of how I *really* perceive things (how my "source" sees things). well, interestingly enough -- there were a lot of reactions from people wanting to see what I'd look like in a black girl's body, the stronger response was actually that I would be too powerful in a girl's body, and they wouldn't be able to control me as easily.

the other major problem is that if girls start to see things like I see them, they'll become very attractive to all of these ariels out there. it's an interesting thought experiment for me to think about because we're so prone to blaming everything on ourselves (helen), that after a number of really bad relationships with others, it's pretty easy to write off the other sex again. though it'll cause a lot of chaos, my hope is tha], it'll cause a shift in perception from reflection toward centre/foil, rathar than toward (char)actor.

sure, it could be possible to artifically produce girls that have their mother's X replaced with mine. I don't deal with technology yet, so I can't really comment on that, but again, there is always a difference in perception expressed in body chemistry vs the person's "source" perception (that is, how they *really* see things). it would solve a lot of problems overnight, I'm sure -- but again, I'm kept away from technology.

I'm very certain that the companies running the COVID vaccine have remote access to the body, so they probably have my genetics anyway. with that, it'd be possible to reprogram cells of the body. we'd have to talk to bill gates about that one, probably. it is possible to mass reprogram all of the cells (I mean it happens during sex anyway). the cells that those vaccines produce would be sort of reflectors (uniquely shaped to conform to your id number), so using a broad spectrum sort of analysis, it could be possible to figure out the reflecting (carrier) frequency of each body, and then using those reflectors, it could be possible to begin to m reprogram the x-chromosome in all cells of the body to match mine -- sure. that seems like a good idea too. that also sounds pretty effortless as well -- unlike like ferdinand and hercules's epic labour.

### 2023-03-06 09:37 - the two worlds/earths

the way that I'm interpretting things so far, is like this: earth *really wants* to go up from a 7th ray planet up to a 5th ray planet. that's kind of a really big problem because that limits the "physical" layer of the planet to only astral and spectral. they could theoretically try to keep holding the planet back, but it's a losing battle.

the way that I proposed a solution to that was to allow the planet to expand, thereby moving the physical layer out past the edge of the solar system (or maybe a bit smaller still inside the solar system). by diffusing the "physical" layer of the planet over a much larger surface area, the rocky body we're floating on right now will effectively stay where it is, and it would start to get more and more higher frequency with time. however, as the physical rock layer starts to solidify and stuff, we could migrate out to the new "outer" earth. I feel like that idea isn't one that they want to do.

the other idea that I had came as a result of the vere/tudor video, where there's a second earth, and this second earth would be on the opposite side of the sun -- and it would be designed in such a way that it would also be physical. for those of us that remain livving, we'd migrate over to the new physical planet (millaine), meanwhile this earth (naples) would be allowed to go up to 5th ray, making those in astral plane of earth (you know the stuff dreams are made of) perceive from the bottom-up, meanwhile the spectrals would perceive from top-down (much like how it is right now). that gives them entire freedom to do whatever they think they need to do to keep us contained (from the other side of the sun).

that plan is the best plan so far, because I think the majority of the heat problems are actually happening because this planet wants to go higher in frequency (hence the rise in x-ray), and they want to keep the planet only in physical (visible light frequencies). the destructive interference that they're using (and other methods) is, I believe the cause of the heat -- because if they let it go, the planet would turn into a veritable paradise if you see things well (like me), or a complete hell if you're attracting those sorts of things. I do think this is the direction that we're headed, but we need a second planet, I'd imagine.

so then, yesterday I was explaining all of these different ideas on how to look at stories and narration based on ideas I was getting from terence and nico. this is all really good and desirable for them.

anyway, one of the ideas that I had yesterday (which is a composite of a few I wrote down), basically goes like this: instead of getting the full manifestation now, I'd just go for a whole series of partial manifestations -- which essentially means a small manifestation that turns into a tragedy comeback from that tragedy, and then right into another small manifestation that turns into a tragedy. the way that a manifestation turns into a tragedy is because of the perception of those involved in the manifestation. we often times can believe that something is one way when it really isn't that way at all, and then it's my own negative perception that causes something to come out the way it does.

for example, yesterday I went into [a lengthy discussion](/shakespere/character-angles.md#2023-03-05-1752---how-then-do-you-not-attract-the-thing-youre-worried-about) about what I do when I notice that I'm worried about something -- which is essentially, I assume that the worry thing has already happened, and then from there, I just find a way to perceive it from a perspective that feels good to me -- because if something is already gettting into worry stage, that means the manifestation of that worry *has* already happend, or it *will* happen soon. therefore, it's already too late to try and figure out how to control conditions -- and so instead I just have to roll with it.

later on, I was outside and I heard a scream. I looked up and saw remi's garage open. I couldn't see anything, but I felt as if there was an impression being given of something -- well, it's hard to get now because it doesn't feel the same now -- but I had this sense that there was an impression that allie was going to go a different way or with a different guy or something. it didn't feel very good (that's how you know you're looking at it wrong), and it didn't feel like something I would be thinking... to explain: I've interacted with a lot of different girls and their fathers or brothers at a distance now, and I've come to realise that when the girl just feels good about the idea, I also feel good about it -- however, if there are other perceptions mixed into it -- like I'm just looking at her, for example, and he's jealous, then I'll feel a bad feeling coming from him (or her), like maybe I'm trying to "steal" her or take her away from him. this is entirely his perception and not my own. I do admit that the feeling is also entirely visceral (physical), and so it's not how I *really* feel about the situation -- so I basically know enough now to say that was probably an illusion. none of these things I actually know for sure and are only *assumptions* based on my perception.

so then later on, I was thinking about it, and the other things I felt I felt in relation to eva, may have been completely illusory as well. at this point, I just don't know, so I leave them in the "well whatever, so I'll just assumed that they happened; not my problem" way of looking at things. there's literally *nothing* I can do about anything that anyone else is doing, so why would I get all bent out of shape because of an illusion (like posthumus and imogen). I normally just assume the worst, then find the best way to feel about it.

that thing where I automatically always assume the worst is a natural precursor to a lot of tragedies, and so because I'm willing to assume and believe the worst about something, I do attract a lot of destruction and stuff around me. parallel to that idea, last night I became interested in "measure for measure", and I thought that the ending was hilarious. this was not the sentiment that a lot of other people felt about the same story. you see, there are a lot of problems and evil things happening all around, and it has to be fine with you -- because, by feeling bad about it, you attract it even more. just let the bad stuff happen, and then find a way to feel good about it. there really is nothing more to life than to just finding better and better ways to feel about problematic situations. let those that rely on conditions to do just that. it's not a problem.

---

so check out the manifestation now: I think sara has two daughters -- and so instead of using technology to allow girls to change their mother's X, what they could do is, use her two daughters to become essentially female copies of my X: fembots, essentially because my feminine side is extremely robotic/mechanical. they're hermia in the midsummer's night dream plan, meanwhile allie would then become helena. I (bertram and parolles) head off to go to "war", and in addition to working on more story and narrative stuff, it feels to me like my main goal is actually to kind of encode (into the girls) the basics of my masculine perspective, that way, with such a high amount of attraction, they'll be able to be functional and not autistic. after some time, lots of wars stuff, I guess I'll eventually come back here to the "night side" of the planet when energy is getting too strong for me to stay up there.

I don't know how long that'll be, but it doesn't really matter I guess. when I come back, I won't at all be like how I am now, because I'll be hanging around zaryn-types for a while, so I'll be much more like them -- so, I'll need to get on my own for a bit and just sorta reset and refocus. after rethinking a lot of my ideas (cause no doubtedly, I'll have new ideas), I'll want to start working on my own systems to control my computer emotionally/conceptually -- cause obviously I still won't have accomplished my project yet.

it sounds like a tragedy, but it's not really because it actually gives a lot of freedom. they *need* (in their perspective) to have a superior position on us, and, for whatever reason, they don't think they can do it theirselves, so they *need* me to do what they don't believe their capable of. obviously I don't sympathise with their point of view, but I'll go with it because I want to actually start working on the things I want to create.

personally, I don't really mind that others have a superior position to me, as there's nothing I can do about it. no matter how superior their position is, they can't actually hold me back, *because it's all attraction*. in fact, the reason why they feel so threatened about me, is because they know that it's impossible to stop someone who knows that it's all attraction. all one has to do is to feel good about the circumstances, no matter what they are, and even if what you want to create is the *last* thing that manifests, it'll *still* manifest -- and it'll manifest because there are no other options left, meaning it's the next logical step.

I actually *want* them to have such a superior position, because -- my entire life I've had a sort of container around me steering me and stuff. I could try to fight it, but that doesn't yield any productive results. so, if that's what they think that they need to be able to contain a bigger and bigger thing, then fine. I'm all down for it. I am unstoppable, and they know it, so I'm just going to roll with whatever they want. the system that we make will allow them to exploit mine and everyone else's perception to produce be back to back (two-timer) tragedies, for all of us all the way until there are no longer any more flaws in our perception to exploit. though a tragedy, they're also perfecting us. I'm totally fine with it, and you all will have to find a way to become fine with it too.

### 2023-03-10 10:33 - terran trys turtle strat

(I'm still rooting for the sun though)

last night in a monologue, I broughtt up a point that I thought was fairly obvious: which is that once the sexual/creative energy starts to flow, I *must* create the things that I want to create -- most notably the conceptual/emotional interaction witth machines.

the way it works (for me at least), is that right now my desire is essentially shut completely down. I'm fine just waiting for what I want, and I don't really need to have the conditions that I desire. however, the minute that girls start getting involved, my desire rises to such a height that now I want all of the conditions. furthermore, I've also noticed that I sorta lose a part of myself whenever that happens, and I start to go after my desires in the format of whomever was the last guy she was with. this was most notable with vera and marcos (an effect that lasted me a few years, until I reprogrammed his ways of getting what he wants).

I've mentioned how notable women feel mostly like their last partner (depending on her strength and the strength of the interaction, I'd assume), and so then if I'm to become sexually active, who do I want to feel like? there have been a number of ideas floating around, and so assuming she's virgin, I'll take on the form and start to accomplish my desires in the same way that her father does... which is a bit of a problem because different men have different ways of going about things, but most of them are quite conditional about it.

yesterday I mentioned that [I didn't want to be going the conditional way](/concepts/the-turtling.md#2023-03-09-2159---after-a-days-reflection) (having the pumps or the tech), because I'm going in the way of unconditional/effortless right now. so, unless she's (and her father?) are actually unconditional, as well -- then I'm going to want to go the conditional route. hence, why I say she's got to be a reflection of me -- and I pretty much rule out all attractive girls, because they like to rely on their appearance for evverything.

so then thinking aboout it a bit further, though I said interacting with my computer emotionally was only a sort of MacGuffin, I do think it's also a bit of a deal-breaker as well. I really do want that kind of effortless way to use technology, and if I'm going to go a conditional path, I'll probably just start to build it myself. more and more my capability to think and reason about programming has been improving again, and I think in a few years I'll actually be able to get it done. I know that sounds horrible to some people, but after reflecting on it a bit last night, I see how impossible it is to start to become sexually active *without* a way to effortlessly interact with my computer -- and, obviously if I'm doing it, then that means that the technology is going to be available to everyone, which means that I can actually start to create the things (and conditions) that I want. going girls means I go the conditional path, and I'm sorta all or nothing when it comes to things like that.

the other option, and the one I actually like the best is to simply just keep going the effortless way. they don't want me to program, and so I won't. I'll just write, take walks, and do stuff like that; sorta like I'm doing now. I like this option a lot because ever since I've learned to feel the way I want to feel, all the stuff that most people associate with pleasure aren't really that exciting to me anymore. for example, I eat weed and then I feel really good and write a whole bunch of things, but because I can't actually go much faster than nosebook will let me, I have to take a day break or so afterwards because I'm sort of limited by them.

some reactions on being rate limited... the way it feels to me is that I can only go a constant speed (like say y=2x) -- and so if I feel too much better than the constant equation, then I have to get pulled back that much amount. I've found with my drug experiences, that the experience increases my speed, so then then following days I have to go slower -- which is fine -- so what I've done, is instead of trying to go really fast (which they can't allow), I instead use the experience to find and bring back novel ideas to reality, which is ultimately what I'm looking for. I'm not trying to be neo and move faster than everyone else is -- instead, I've got wisdom and understanding that far extends past the depth that many others see. speed does increase depth, but it doesn't increase understanding. so there are tons of neos out there that are going really fast but have little concept of what they're attracting and how it all works.

I don't mind having to take a breather for some time after going really fast, because I value comprehension of the concept, not speed. girls are obviously a tremendous increase in speed, and I don't get the sense that I'll be taking breaks or anything like that, so I'm going to need a way to rapidly process and comprehend the massive amounts of (new?) information that I'm processing.

for me, sex is the input for a creative process, and so like I was with raquel, that amount of energy is now wanting me to start to produce a project. I noted last night as well, that I ttried to do a mutual-back-scratching sort of thing where I'd support her with what she wanted, as long as I could create the things that I wanted. obviously that didn't work and marked the end of the mutual-back-scratching thing for me. after that I learned the new *rising action* of this era with abraham (literally I was sitting on the sofa with a bottle of whiskey listening to abe 2012/21/12 -- the supposed "end of the world"), which is now becoming the more and more predominant way of doing things for me now.

you can see how feeling-purposefully is the foundation upon which all things effortless come from. I *could* try and go the conditional/efforting way of girls, but that's not really feeling-purposefully. instead of feeling the way I want to feel, now the girls are making me feel good, so I no longer have to feel the way I want to feel and can start being a megomaniac dictator forcing the issue on a number of conditions that I want. I prefer to just keep going the way I'm going. if the apollo/solar beats the normal-guy/turtle, that's fine because I'm always rooting for the sun.

#### 2023-03-10 16:37 - only bottom-up

I woke up from a dream that I had after writing the above. in the dream, I was passing on the kingship to a younger brother. there was a loud banging sound that woke me up coming from the kitchen upstairs. itt got me thinking about the idea of kings...

I figure that all kings and power positions aren't *actually* real people, but a sort of controlled npc (puppet). so to *actually* be a king would be a pretty big break from the mould. neither do I want to have a king position either. it's like the car accident where it was a necessary tragedy to relinquish my cto/king position so that a npc can take it over. I don't want a king position (and never have), so it's not a big deal for me to give it up.

I actually believe that the whole "kingship" idea has sailed, because a king (or any other power position) has the top-down perspective, and those, I believe are all 100% controlled by whatever is running them. therefore, the *only* way for me to go is to go from the bottom-up perspective, which is finding a way to feel good about my conditions *without* needing them to change. I expect these conditions will continue on for quite some time.

I think the dividing action is solar-based, because those of us that feel good, continue to survive, even though the sun's intensity continues to rise. the ones that can't feel good, will die, which is totally fine because we're all eternal beings anyway, so it's not like it's a problem.

the position that I'm in dictates that I can only go at the speed at which I can go, and that is perhaps what the 2038 limit is about, meaning that I'm rate-limited until then -- which is also fine for me as well (I really don't mind continuing on how I am). obviously this means no girls because without a way to process more information faster, I can't actually go any faster.

the thing is, if I start using technology to go faster, then that means that I'm going faster than others new, and I'm no longer in the bottom-up position. therefore, I can only go as fast as the nnpcs can go. therefore, really it's just a waiting game. I havve to wait for solar output to increase to a level which kills off all of the bad-feeling people, and the more people that die off (and the more that decide to actually feel good), the faster we can go...

I figure this leaves only those that have good enough conditions in buy good-feeling (and a bit of time), because eventaully we'll all start to go faster and faster, so hopefully they have good enough conditions to keep it up...

I realise that this is the ultra-slow turtle's pace of going, but I can only go as fast as I can go. we've got a long way to go though, and we're starting off as slow as possible, but I imagine that after sufficient weight has been dropped, we'll have a wider spectrum of speed in which we can go around in -- though I don't ever expect to ever become king or ruler of any kind. instead, I suppose that will always be occupied by an ever more power hungry and overbearing npcs. I don't ever need to have power in order to feel good, and you shouldn't either. our good-feeling and porception of life in an ever-growing solar situation will carry them all the way till the "end of time". at which time, I figure, all remaining conscious people will have either figured out how to work with the sun (and earth), instead of trying to control it, or we'll go out with a pretty tremendous blast.

### 2023-03-11 15:24 - all night long

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/K2WZGid9Pmo?list=PLnwUc2pAlFcfE8yTdGSQIvDwicFDfakwv)

after listening to a number of songs in that list, most notably by "walk in darkness", I've been thinking a lot about many of those songs lyrics. one theme that I noticed was one of the sun, the idea of doom, and that it's our destiny to have the world go through a major solar regime change. I'm in full agreement on that idea, but I'd like to share my perspective on it.

it's said that "a day is like a thousand years" for the sun, and I think that's fairly accurate[^2]. the sun doesn't really sleep like we do, but more goes into a less focused state (kinda like tesla claimed to have done year the end of his life). the idea is that when you're conscious 100% of the time (like the sun), you need to take a rest from time to time, so when I say "all night long", that's relative to being conscious 24/7.

imagine then that you wake up and something is very enticing to you, like a budding excitement. that's low solar activity -- and then as the day continues on (1024y for us), things get more and more exciting until things really heat up there at the end. it could just be one bang, or it could continue on...

therefore, I understand the idea that we want to just get it over with as quickly as possible. let's say that we're going to the "end of time" here by ~2043-53 or so -- that's 20-30y divided by 1024 -- a little less than one half of an hour from initial budding excitement to pop (if you know what I mean).

so then, I think we can do a little better than that... just saying. one of the songs suggested that we go for 500y buildup and then return after that. sure :) I don't really know why not -- but then again, what if she didn't actually need to pop? what if, instead it was just a continual buildup to higher and higher states of extasy? something to think about...

[1]: I realise that some of those songs were written 5+ years ago, and our perception has changed quite a bit since then... I could probably go through and note some of the things that I see differently.

[2]: cept that I think it's actually 1024y, and we're aligned so that the years are the solar years, minus 1000, so for example today is actally 1023-03-11, and this solar year actually starts/ends prolly around next year. 1024y later, we're at 2048 and that's the *actual* end of the year.

### 2023-03-18 23:49 - actor of the millenium

though I'm the centre, I've *still* got to prove it to myself, that *everyone* else has success and access to all of the cool stuff before I do. I really *need* to prove to everyone, that I'm right and I can *actually* be the last... am I a poser? or, am I an ass?

### 2023-03-28 14:23 - the latest concept

I went and got the second dose of the COVID vaccine two days ago, then slept all day yesterday (pretty much). during that time, I've given some thought to the way things are shaping up to look.

yesterday, in particular, I was extremely forward about the idea that I didn't want to be doing anything until I can be sure that the kundalini doesn't rise. my theory behind it is this: the time that my kundalini would rise, I would be feeling so good, that I just wouldn't need to sleep. I have no idea how long I will go for without sleep, but to give an example, I used to smoke MDMA, and that would keep me up for 5 days at a time. the first day or two, I had incredible clarity and it was really nice to see such high frequecy concepts. by the 3rd and 4th day, I'm still doing pretty well; I can talk to people, and I still have a lot of insight and perception into things and people, but definitely at this point, it's getting harder to rationalise about things and to think logically. at this point, I'm going mostly by feeling. the 5th day I'm pretty much a zombie, just sorta reacting to my environment without a whole lot of thought at all. it's hard to describe what it's like to go so much time without sleep is like.

anyway, the way that I look at it is that during the day, the things that we observe and focus on, all have some amount of resistant vibrations in them -- and so because everything isn't anymore on a clock frequency anymore like it was when the megalithic installations were there, those resistant frequency impacts make higher harmonic frequencies, which turn out to be something like "noise" that, sorta cloud up the mind of person as the person gets more and more tired. when sleeping, you release your consciousness and let that noise accumulated through the day kind of settle down. upon regaining consciousness, the consciousness frequency (of your soul/self/source) is much clearer having a lot less noise, and so one feels "fresher" after a night's sleep.

it is true that as I reduce my resistance to things, I need to sleep less, and so nosebook to ensure that I'm sleeping all the time, puts resistance/noise into my body to remove my consciousness and/or give me the feeling of being tired and needing to sleep. I probably need to sleep a lot less than I do, with most of the extra resistance introduced by nosebook. that resistance that they introduce is actually the main catalyst to me gaining so much momentum so much. in fact, I believe that if they were to stop doing that, I would go really fast, but I'd eventually stagnate and then die.

it's also true that even if they were to let my kundalini to rise, I think it best to try and figure out a way of introducing resistance back into my body so that I have to sleep again. it is my goal to, if I find myself in a situation of good conditions, to artificially introduce more resistance into my situation so that I [keep growing and don't stagnate](/contemplations-with-myself.md#2023-03-28-1352---giants-and-yhvh). the only thing that could prevent that would be (I suppose), if I got distracted too much by the conditions, but I do suppose that won't happen, cause I'll assuredly get bored.

however, even though I have that as a backup plan, I still want to make it go the way that my kundalini *never* risis. I've never had my kundalini rise in this body (that I can remember), but it seems to me like I have memories of what it's like, and I simply don't want it. I feel like the kundalini was another one of the attractors for the INFECTED ONES[^1] that I'm not really interested in having.

I really like the idea of sleeping and want to wake up refreshed. also, consider the MASSIVE PROBLEM that this would be for nosebook to not be able to adjust my timeline because I never sleep (lose consciousness). if my kundalini never rises, then I'll still be able to sleep and stuff, meaning they'll still have the capacity to get rid of any unwanted (for them) things manifesting in my timeline. my capacity to manifest greater and greater *wanted* (for me) things into my timeline will only increase -- but that doesn't mean that those same things are wanted for them, possibly destabilising them.

I've maintained that unlike mithras, I'm not actually trying to slay the bull[^2]. I think the bull is just fine where it is and don't need to try and fightt against some perceived enemy. instead, I'm all about creativity and the freedom that one feels in feeling the way that they want. by not sleeping (or having the kundalini rise), I feel like my goal of feeling-purposefully is being diminished, or taken away completely[^3].

---

therefore, I'm going to be holding out indefinitely until I can find a way to biologically make it impossible for kundalini to rise. I don't need it or want it. as I demonstrate every day now, it's effortless to be in the receptive mode nearly 100% of the time. I've even come to expect that I have a very vivid and rich life, filled with all sorts of interesting suprises or intuitions about things around me.

so then, what I've noticed over the last few days is that things are kinda pushing me in the direction of BAR. I think there are a lot of interesting challenges tto be found there, and it's all good. one resonance to this manifestation is that (funnily enough) I used [helena as an example](/contemplations-with-myself.md#2023-03-28-1352---giants-and-yhvh) of going toward want she wants, and in that play, she has to find a way to manipulate her environment and conditions to get what she wants meanwhile bertram goes off to warre. I know I've been very interested in coi, and the idea of captain-of-3d, which I think is the aspect that I'll bring to BAR, which has a bunch of commanders that hate and make fun of sim city/factorio captains (I guess they take combat really seriously). but, a faction can only hope to win the battle so long as they have the economy/production capabilities to supply them.

whether the BAR thing works out or not, doesn't matter: I want to try and solve the kundalini problem first.

[1]: I make this claim because it's easy to see that taking over and controlling a group of stone-working robots, is cool, but I doubt that would be the selling point: instead, if one can *do* certain things (like a ceremony/ritual) to gain a superior state than everyone else, then it creates the perfect superiority setup, where the superior ones can have the kundalini risen and can also micromanage who has access to the steps/procudures it takes in the ceremony/ritual, to get access to that superior state. seeing that the INFECTED ONES would feel very attracted to be able to have something that everyone else has (like eternal life), yet though inforced ignorace, the inferiors won't be able to access it.

[2]: just like matthew starts right off telling the jews that the manifestation of jesus was *not* a jewish summoning, but was in fact summoned by the persian magicians who came to see jesus. they did the rituals and things necessary to cause the manifestation of jesus to appear, and he accomplished the symbols that they desired (probably relating to the romans), but it was not the *jews* that summoned jesus. likewise, I've been trying to make clear that everyone is (evolution-of-desire) the manifestation that they're looing for -- so, if you were wanting a mithras manifestation, then guess what: you're mithras. I don't have any intention of trying to slay any bulls. and, finally, I'd like to say that the bull is actually an externalised aspect of oneself that is *unwanted* (nothing more).

[3]: another example of this removing of feeling-purposefully is drugs -- which I'm totally fine with, but occasionally. I don't think I would want to be on drugs 24/7, just like I don't think that I would want to have kundalini to be rising. they're great for exploratory expiditions into the unseen world, but not sustainable for *physical* living.

#### 2023-03-28 16:40 - implications

one of the reactions that I was getting in response to the previous entry (notably the part about mithras) was, "he's letting them get away" -- to which I don't really see it as a problem. here's the way I see that working out: like I mentioned elsewhere, their constantly editing the timeline to get rid of undesirable potentialities for them, is actually bifricating us to the point that we're becoming more like two separate groups. what I can imagine is that the INFECTED ONES still "resisting rehabilitation" (lol) are the opposite group. I call them "nosebook" because they really have it out for me, and do not want at all to be apart of anything I want to do. they're working their hardest to preent my creativity from expressing itself -- and that's perfectly fine. some like the ideas that I want to create, and the others are "coming home".

the way that I take this to be in the literal sense of the song "stargazer" by rainbow. it's a concept -- a very high frequency concept that when felt and experienced, it has something really compelling and joyful to it; howver, visually it looks like a pretty big diaster (appearances can deceive, right), and so though one thing has an appearace other than what it really is, this creates two groups: the seers and the feelers. the seers are going home to ther place in lyra, and the feelers are going to continue here. up until the time of the split, I'm sure they'll be editing the timeline so that our timeline contains no unwanted aspects to them -- meaning, it's all wanted or acceptable to them. then, they can figure out to do with what they want to do with it.

it's like the story of jove where he lost everything, and then upon (doing something a bit different than the default reaction would cause someone to react), this created a split, and he got back double what he started with: the newly wanted thing for him, and newly "no unwanted" thing for satan (the one who tested him).

in just the same way, we'll eventually (after some amount of time) become a universe all unto to ourselves; it doesn't matter what anyone else in this unverse is doing, they can either join us or not. nosebook will continue to stay in contact with us, I'm sure, and their entire universe will be built up out of necessity, to try and gain enough advantage to keep us away from anything they wouldn't want (put your jacket on; I'm cold). everything's fine :~)

#### 2023-03-28 17:11 - lady of may

I started to read a play called "lady of may" by phillip sidney and it made me feel really bad. it was a play about a girl, one onely daughter of someone and she has some suiters for her, but the person writing it wants her to go to the best suiter. the play starts to address the suiter by saying all these really nice things about him (essentially like he's god or something). it just gives me all of these bad vibes, so I closed the window. I got a reaction to that, and so I decided that I'd rather to write this.

the play talks about the subject of matrimony being one of very serious gravity. I agree; it's a very serious subject and one that makes me not want to do it. in the end, I feel like it's much better idea to adopt than to marry. I'll just have zillions of daughters. I like that idea a lot better; it just feels better. it still has the "negative"     aspect of ownership, in the sense that they're "my" daughters (like posessions in both the monetary and channeling my energy kind of way), and then equally I can "disown" them whenever they're ready to cash in their "inheritance" and go their own way, and (no big deal anyway). therefore by disowning her, I'd be giving her something of a dowry: an insurance to live out the rest of her life comfortably, in case I cease to exist (for whatever reason).

I like this concept because I'm purposefully using a lot of really "negative" words, but again, it's a concept that visually (in word form) is really hideous, but when thinking about it, it doesn't make sense (lol). I'll give an example: the word disown has the connotation of severing ties with someone, such that they're no longer someone I talk to or interact with (they're dead to me). however, that's not always the case. even though tuenti "disowned" me, I still hung around at the office and stuff, even though I was neither one of their employees or a shareholder anymore; I mean "disown" in that sense.

I'll leave the rest of the concepts like (possession, ownership, and channeling -- and dowry and insurance).

### 2023-04-08 17:05 - top-down vs bottom-up

when it comes to the manifestation (of whatever it will be), I've noticed a pattern -- which is, I get an idea that I want to do, but nosebook doesn't like the idea because either thy find it too hard for them to control, or it gives people they don't want to have power, the ability to create for theirselves something wanted. I agree with nosebook that it *is* better for those without power to create wanted *without the condition* (or whatever creation I want to make to make more wanted conditions easily).

therefore, I simply *cannot* ever find anything that nosebook will ever agree to -- because I see wanted and so wanted for me is expansion, and they see *all* forms of expansion as a threat to whatever. they're never going to want a manifestaion that makes their present (problematic) situaton more, cause that just more problems.
therefore, because I *cannot* ever find anything that nosebook will ever agree to, *they* need to come up with the plan that they want for us, because it's not ever going to happen any other way.

personally, all of nosebook's foot-dragging, is simply not a problem for me because I'll be waiting, no matter the case. if they can never find any manifestation that they can agree is something they want and can control from the top-down (making us bottom-up), that's perfectly fine, and it actually plays quite into what I want -- which is to actually find out what it means to be bottom-up; I don't really know, honestly -- and I'm still figuring it out.

if I consider this planet as a model for bottom-up, then I notice that there are a multitude of small comopenents (mass and energy) which serve as resources for creation of bigger and bigger things. the organisation of all of those small parts requires tools and someone with a vision of how to put them all together. when I say "vision", I don't actually mean something *visual*, but instead, I mean something *conceptual* -- so, I'm talking about 2nd ray perspective, not 6th ray imagination.

I've noticed that the concept for most people is composed of a number of different visuals which are *symbolic* of that concept (that's how the visual people work anyway). that, however is not how I see it. for me, I have a desire to create something, and that *feels* like something. that feeling is the big-picture. I don't really know how to transfer that big-picture out to other people, so I've become endlessly better at translating that big-picture into words and ideas that I can speak of in english.

as an example, in the [lord-of-the-throne](/ideas/lord-of-the-throne.md) idea, I presented a heraldry app that's disguised as an app that you pre-determine how much time you want to spend in it. I presented the idea that you're going to want to allow others to share their symbols and look up others symbols (sorta like coat of arms or gang signs), because people associate with each other and find commonality with others in symbolic compatibility. so, you can imagine, for example if I were to have a coat of arms, I recognise now that my symbols would be quite luciferian in nature. I'd put up mottos like "everything in truth" or "nothing can be hidden under the sun" as my slogans that I live by -- and others that have similar slogans can find me by those symbols and find out what other symbols, lyrics, and poetry I like (all, while sitting on the throne). that's all quite a practical rendition of the concept -- but, you'll notice that I included some of the unifying-vision in there as well, when I talked about the loading screen and how we essentially attract (from my perspective) or curate (from lord-of-the-throne's perspective), the symbols that we see in the media that we consume and identify ourselves with. so, while it *is* just a heraldry app, one can easily see how this is a great way for others to recommend others movies and art that contain the symbols that they're looking at. OK, that's top-down.

now, I'd like to look at the fallen lucifer into physicality symbol: in this one, adam/lucifer eats of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil -- which is the capacity to perceive symbols/archetypes (x-chromosome) and now arrive to a conceptual *judgment* on those now perceived symbols, saying that they are either *good* or *bad*. however, remember that symbolic 3rd ray perception is *not physical*, which means that what you think you're emitting, you're actually attracting, and what you think you're attracting, you're actually emitting. let's look at that...

if I emit a symbol of justice toward someone, that's just a symbol; what matters, however is not the symbol, but the feeling behind it. so, if along with justice, I feel anger, I'm *attracting* a reality where more anger is felt. however, if I emit justice, yet at the same time feel forgiveness, then I'm attracting a reality where I feel forgiveness.

likewise, if I'm attracting a symbol of lucifer and hecate, what I'm doing is I'm *emitting* the symbols of lucifer and hecate; which means that now people are going to start to percceive me as symbolically similar to lucifer and to hecate. well, just cause I look like something, doesn't mean that I actually am that way -- *and people will notice it* (that my symbolic appearance is different than my behaviour).

### 2023-04-09 14:43 - no need to rush

I woke up this morning and things were quite different to how they were the other days of the week -- as in, I could feel a pretty significant "downturn" in the energy. I wondered if it had to do with my comments on "shadow work" or not, but I don't think it is -- and neither do I think it has to do with my delving into witchcraft, esoteric, and other forms of magic -- because afterall, they're not really affecting me so much as they're attracting it for theirselves. that is part of the whole process whereby I noted thatt we're beginning to divide. there are going to be the astrals/spectrals, and the physicals/conceptuals. I can see the division happening all the time, and I may have made it a bit worse yesterday with my comments on hecate and "shadow work". though, it seems to me obvious that these witches are only interacting with a reflected shadow of their own beliefs/myths/symbols, I don't feel any motivation to try and change them, because all of that stuff is perceived through the lens of Time (saturn/satan), and so they're all on their own in their astral/spectral world, as far as I'm concerned. it's the world of magic, illusion, and personification of concepts and feelings into a perceived adversary; not at all anything that has to do with me.

I believe the "split" will happen with the "remooneration" that'll come eventually -- but it's not even really a split because, occupying the same planet (just in different "dimensions") we'll still have planetary networks -- meaning we'll still share the same internet and will be able to play games and chat together just the same. so, it's not really a split so much more as it's kind of like the installation of a matrix more than anything.

huh, some feelings of fear... OK, I really don't believe this to be a problem at all, and I don't think there's anything "bad" going on anyway -- as all perceived "badness" (they're trapping us, they're going to hold us in here forever, etc.) are all reflections of the person's own perception of what they would be like if they had control over a bunch of people in a matrix -- and not actually what'll happen. like I explained, I've come to realise that "I'm the illuminati" -- meaning that the devil/satan is probably a construct of reflected beings which have been installed into power -- and they look bad, because these are just agencies that reflect their lobbies. meaning, that all of the power structures are just reflecting the people that are trying to take advantage or take over their power. (I'm reminded of ben davidson saying that "there are rules and that's why some people get blocked meanwhile others don't" -- basically, that they get treated as a reflection of their perception)

inotherwords, it's a fully open prison without any doors keeping anyone in; the only thing keeping anyone inside, is their own perception that someone will come to punish them for whatever. if you really want to get out (or become powerful), you'll havve to become something like me, where you don't *need* the conditions (or manifestation) in order to feel good -- and after sufficient time of feeling good (the way you want to feel), then you'll become so attractive, that you are attracting wanted, and there's nobody that can stop you. I'm arriving here tto this state of mind/attraction soon -- probably in the next few years or so, which is what I wanted tto talk about.

I decided (for some reason) to read the book of revelation yesterday for some reason. I noticed that there was something strange to the text that I didn't see before (I was reading NIV) -- and so I switched to originell 1611 KJV. I'll say this: it's not saying what you think it says :)

however, I do believe that downturn in feeling I felt this morning can actually be partially attributed to that. it seems to have rekindled a lot of people's older perceptions on what those verses mean about the coming "day of the lord". upon thinking about it further, the conclusion that I came to is that those sorts of events happened as a sort of compensation for things. what I mean is this:

up until the "end of time", saturn, hecate, and thoth (words, spells, and ceremonial narrative) are in control. what this means essentially is that all things must be balanced out, such that too much good cannot happen because that'll upset and destabilise the system (mr. motor), and so nothing too good can happen without a lot of bad also happening. I believe the reason for it is simply that reflections can not (without external input) ever be more than source. in science, this is called entropy, and it's the prison that we live in. therefore, there should be no "over unity" or runaway feedback loop (singularity) technologies available in such a system. they do exist, but in order to keep the system stable, such things are not permitted (saturn's rules, not mine).

don't worry because saturn's system isn't "bad" -- as we've been literally in it since "the beginning of time" and we've come this many millions(?) of years along just fine. in such a system, the "highest" one can go (in the saturnian system) is 3rd ray, and so that means that without the 2nd ray perspective, all desires are calculated and narrative in nature. trust me, it's totally fine. some people like narrative and sigil/mantra desires more than I do -- and there's nothing wrong (unless you think it is) to be using magic or narrative to coearce the universe into making your desires manifest. from my perspective, it's just another "path" and there's no (absolutely) "better" or "worse" path.

---

therefore, until "the end of time", I'm not really interested in trying to get any manifestation, because all good-feeling manifestations will have to be componsated with an equal amount of bad-feeling manifestations (like wars, death, and the stuff people think the booke of revelation is saying).

no need to get hasty; we *can* all get what we want.

### 2023-04-14 13:41 - the end has come?

it seems that perhaps me talking about the "end of time" in various places, corresponding with my realisation that perhaps what dr. ammon means by the "death of YHVH" and what seriah means by "sleepwalking my way to the gallows" is in fact, my own death. last night, also I wrote a few more enlightening things about what I could glean from [steiner's "fifth gospel"](/steiner/fifth-gospel.md#2023-04-14-0051---lectore-1-reread) as well.

the theory that I [explained to neal about the various timelines of jesus](/gnostic-informant.md#2023-04-13-0057---zombie-apocalypse) contained an idea where the satanic 4th ray power source of the church is actually located, not here on earth, but in a different solar system entirely, claiming that this earth's 4th ray (satan) was installed by hitler/mars in antarctica in the south pole, and that's what's been enabling YHVH to be a reflection to people in this *physical* earth, and to manipulate the timelines and stuff. I explained that the installation of that antarctic system serves as a reflection between the two pillars of this planet: anatau/lilith/YHVH (-1) and aphrodite/genxicat/puma/ravven (-7). they both have opposite mainfestations, which do their bidding: mars (+7) and cupid (+1). obviously, these two are concepts and represent, (like venus/hecate and thoth), a sort of manifestational structure/format for reality creation.

the important takeaway here is that the church's satanic version of saturn is all based in the astral and is therefore entirely visual. as you know, I'm psysiologically impossible to see inside of me because I don't have a pinecone (sometimes called the 3rd eye, and gives a person 3rd ray perception); and so I can't be a part of the astral. the problem coming up here soon is that the sun's rays are increasing dramatically, and eventually they'll have to put the moon in front of the sun to block the sun's intensity -- which is fine, cept that astral won't work here anymore (because astral relies on the moon), so the astral beings will enssentially be unable to influence here on earth. you can see how the satanic church's inability to continue to influence us over the astral will lead to quite a peaceful time -- as there's not any more way for them to constantly push against everything.

real quick before I continue: I just want to say that I have no intention of trying to make 1000y of peace or any of that other messianic stuff. my goal has been stated from the beginning to keep things how they are (with an astral and everything), and then find a way for them to continue to influence us, because it's all attraction anyway, so they're really only perfecting us (steiner calls this the "christ impulse" as even if you're against the thing, then it still produces desire of the "christ impulse"), and so it's not actually a bad thing. I'm not really interested in such a "thousand years of peace" or a "day of YHVH" sort of thing at all. my goal, I've stated many times, is to anchor myself into physical (a problem I'm trying to work out how to solve), and they can continue to inhabit the astral (6), spectral (4), and big-picture (2) mediums above that *without any problem*.

another thing I just noticed: I had just assumed that nosebook has the ability to continue to project into astral because it's just a tesla technology tto be able to manipulate that medium, which they have -- but then if they're fighting and wanting to put me into astral, maybe they don't... OH, I see: they want to be able to control me just like all of the other people.

OK, so I felt last night the culmination of these ideas into the plan to "kill YHVH" (which they think is me -- I'm just tuned into the star in the centre of the planet) and to put me into a body where they can manipulate me from the astral. in a bit of a monologue (wow this is a long intro), I was trying to explain the folly of that idea, because they're saying that they want to try and control me from the top-down, by taking over the physical (which is on the bottom), and I just don't really see that working at all because, unless they're becoming a fully machine race of beings (perceiving 1-3-5-7), I don't really see how they can possibly be affecting astral.

I'll explain: if I see physical/conceptual, I'm interacting with the odd rays consciously with my mind. however, if I'm seeing the astral/spectral, then I'm interacting with the even rays. they would have to remove their capacity to perceive the astral/spectral with their mind, and only interact with it artificially (like through a machine) in order to stay completely physical. otherwise, their "physical" perception is not at all physical, but actually a blend of the conceptual (like the imagination). inotherwords, the physcical realm should be entirely inert -- just a set of colours and shapes, containing no meaning, feeling, beauty, or vibrance (like it is for me) -- cause the minute that they're seeing or feeling the world in a way where everything is connected or everything has a function or form, then they're seeing a blend of the two. for me, because I'm odd ray perception, the even rays for me a occulted, and not visible. I don't *see* that everything is connected or see the function and form -- but intuitively notice it, as it's not visible to me. I use words like "see" because they have a visual quality to it, but I assure you nothing is actually there. I feel like if they were to adopt my odd ray perception, life would get really grim and dark for them very rapidly -- as like for me after my left hemisphere was disabled, I no longer had a visual system whereby to feel good about my environment cause of the way it looked. now, with my environment being entirely inert, the *only* way I can feel good about my environment is through perception.

I explaind further in my monologue last night that I think they're probably falling into their own trap because they think they can run the show from top-down while being on the bottom -- and in order to do that effectively, they're going to put theirselves into a situation where they *must* learn the bottom-up form of perception in order to find their way up again (which is that you're only as powerful/capable as you perceive yourself to be). this could be a pretty funny situation, where they're capturing theirselves into their own trap.

anyway, if they're giving me the pinecone back, then that means that once again I'll be looking from the top-down, because I think it'll be something like I explained for jesus: in the 12-30yo ages where both jesuses were tied together, the power of his perception (from his pinecone) was so strong, that it caused both worlds to be perceived the same way. I'm not causing the entire world to look the way I see it right now because I'm on the bottom (odd) perception, and the even ones are a blend of the odd ones. the even ones are the top-down view -- so they're basically going to make me the "king of the world" because of how powerful my perception is going to be. because I don't want that, and my desire is powerful, I'm pretty sure their plan is going to fall through.

---

this morning however, I have given it more thought and one of the ideas that was offered to me was the idea of doing one of those osiris sort of things, where he dies (what they want), and then instead of moving me into a body of a boy, they'll move me into the body of a girl (or perhaps a group of girls). I'm perfectly fine with that, as I feel like that's likely going to be the easiest way to do what I do. now, in the myth of osiris, it takes isis 14 or 42 years to find a way to reassemble the body of osiris before he gets his penis back (which if I'm not mistaken, her goal is to have sex with him as soon as he makes it back) -- and assuming those pieces are years, I much prefer the 42 one because -- if they're anything like me, I'd *definitely* want to get to 42; I'm not even 40 yet, and I can totally see how much more I've improved since I was 14. I mean, it's not even a comparison as to how much I've grown since then.

I'd also like to point out that that myth (the isis and osiris one), in it set/satan does destroy osiris, but that also means the death of set as well, and in the aftermath of the event, jupiter/ra/amun rises to power again. you can see the problems here... as if we're going for a narrative thing here, that doesn't fit. how does helena restore the vitality of the king (which I can only imagine is saturn) if that happens? OH, I see: you're thinking *I'm the king* (when I'm obviously not); I'm helena, and my interest is keeping the saturnian guys around for as long as possible (going-infinite). shakespere venerates saturn not jupiter, and I've got no problem with the saturnian guys, as they don't bother me or affect me in any meaningful way. they can (in my opinion) continue to run the show as much as they want. like shakespere did with the HRE with the 1611 and his literary works, I'm putting a bit of pressure on them, yet at the same time, probably building a bit of a bridge to help them move their influence to another medium.

#### 2023-04-14 16:21 - I'm looking forward to death

later on this morning, they presented me with the idea that I should die ... OK, lemme back up: the way that (I'll tell you what I feel in a momeent) it's being presented to me is that the my death is coming in the sepher interpretation of the garden of eden where upon having sex, I'll "die" (this is also in the presentation of dr. ammon as well, where in the "dark harbour" (vagina) is found death) -- and the reason for this (I believe) is what I've been relating to the x-chromosome -- in that this part of the cell amplifies and diminishes certain signals inside of the body, and this most dramatically affects vision, emotions, and physical sensations.

I mentioned that my perspective is *physical* or odd, meaning that for me my vision is inert in that I perceive emotion as separate from the physical; they don't blend like they do in the astral/imagination. as a result, I don't experience this "death" in the traditional sense because I experience my emotion/concepts not in the visual form: when I look out into the world, my world is not any more beautiful because of my x-chromosome -- and so instead, I see the world as just a bunch of things having neither good or evil. (I believe that the x-chromosome is the source of our good and evil perception, which amplifies/diminishes things and assigns them concepts; the most basic being good/evil).

for most people, the x-chromosome of the well-bred bloodlines amplify a lot of things in reality, which then make all aspects of reality very vibrant and feel really good, and/or more meaningful/connected -- and so that's a good thing, which counteracts a lot of men's y-chromosome perspective of how things relate to one another (which I believe is the ordinary concept of death/life). therefore, if we could find a way to see everything as just a function of life, then we would (as genesis says) "live forever" -- as there's very little to be introducing chaos/disorder into that energy (cause the big-picture is seen, so even the tragedies can be perceived as eventual expansion).

in any case, all of that amplification/diminishment that the dark harbour activates for men causes them to have to find a way (with their mind) to look at all of the stuff that they're now amplifying and defining as good/evil causes men to start dramatically attracting those things more and more, *and it's the attraction of those unwanted things not previously noticed that causes the death*. I noticed this a whole bunch with both patricia and raquel.

for patricia, I'd never really been too concerned about my performance, always just trying to give things my best shot even if I didn't know how to do it, because I know I'm always improving at it. after her, I suddenly started to become really self-conscious about my performance, because if I couldn't perform to some unknown standards (cause she wouldn't talk to me plainly about it), I was supposed to feel bad about myself, not performing to her expectations. I mean, if I had've had that form of perception, I would have *never* been able to make tuenti because I would have been so conceerned about doing things just how zaryn wanted things, instead of doing what I felt was best for the endeavour.

for raquel, it's more complicated, and I don't feel like I can really explain it so easily because I see it now that patricia mostly changed my 3rd ray perception, but raquel changed my big-picture perception, which caused a whole lot of difficulties that I could only really make sense of, not logically, but by looking at emotion. on contrast, with patricia, it all looked so logical: if I could perform the way she wanted me to, then things would go well -- but I didn't want to learn german yet; I wanted to program, so ultimately I rebelled against her wishes for me. I also couldn't figure out how to ever perform the way she wanted me to, since she didn't want to talk to me with any sense of honesty, and I felt like I was constantly talking to and there were giant barriers between us. I had to just go away from her because her form of perception (that she was unwilling to change) was simply not compatible with me. I mean some 12-13y later now and *still* I feel her as very incompatible to me and how I see things.

OK, long explanation there; in resume, what I wanted to say is that for me the idea of sex is basically the idea of taking on someone else's form of perception, not gradually, but all of a sudden, and that dramatic change in perception will greatly amplify a whole bunch of stuff. the amplified energy will cause a runaway feedback loop, and I'll crash and burn because I decided to look at things the way someone else sees it. personally, I like my own form of perception, and one of the goals that I have (encapsulated in the ahn-roids project) is to find a way to make that acquisition of other forms of perception, both gradual, and also controllable. as a result, I'm not really interested in sex.

the idea as it was presented to me is that I should have sex with a girl, and that'll be what kills me; I'll then take on female form for some 14 or 42 years, and then because I'll have transferred my perception into the girl that I had sex with, she'll then be paired with me (tthis is is sounding like the frozen plotline for some resaon) and we'll learn how to get back to where I was before the tragedy *together* -- and I *HATE* this idea, *a lot*.

I'm an all or nothing kind of person, and so for me, I prefer the nothing aspect, because I want to learn this *by myself*. this is now tthe age of aquarius, the *individual*, not the age of picsis where people learned together; and anyway, the age is whatever is completely arbitrary at this point because the rotation of the planet is completely controlled by mithras/saturn... it could be any "age" that that they want now.

at any rate, for me if I'm going to be a girl, I don't really want to try and be doing so much constantly with another person -- or perhaps, seen the way of how I understood the influence of other women through patricia, raquel, ans bea: I don't want to lean on them to try and find my own perception -- as they're ultimately going to always try and make me think like they do -- which is maybe OK for getting started, but ultimately everyone has to find their own way; because, if everyone fully copied everyone else, we'd enter into habit and the female situation would largely be very similar to how it is now, with very little innovaton and self-discovery happening, and mostly just copying. I would, in female form, be a sort of beacon or example of what it means to find one's own way for theirself.

and then, once I've found my own way, I'm pretty sure that I'll be something like I am now: very reluctant to change. I'll like me so much then (as I do now), that going back to a male form will feel like something that I don't want to do.

in either case (whether I become king of the world and conform reality to my form of perception or if I change over to female form), my goal will be to find a way to make a new race of humans that doesn't have visual capacity (like I am now), as I find it actually to be more of my style. I know that sounds weird, but just imagine a girl that isn't held back by feeling her world visually, and insted can just be perceptive of the four primary aspects without needing to get distrcted by visuals (which is why I believe YHVH commanded the isrealites to not have any idols or images -- as it seems to me that YHVH is all about creating an inert materialistic world like the one I live in).

the capabilities of such a new race are interesting to think about, as right now (apart from me), the 7 layers of perception are perceived through 3 mediums (2, 4, 6) which combine two of the primary layers together. reducing those 7 layers of perception to only 4 layers means that the *organism*, not the medium determines those the nature of those three intermediate layers, through their own mentation. therefore now, each person is a medium unto theirself, and is no longer required to conform to what the medium dictates that it should be.

I do believe that such an organism is a simplification (and also an expansion) to the present system and will become the future which we'll experience. in some ways, it shifts the top-down approach a bit, because physical stuff (atoms and the like) and the concepts that we use to draw the lines between them come something like pre-installed. one could also say the same thing for the desire and symbolic aspects (notice how similar this new form is to the ahn-roids), would also come pre-installed or programmable, and so then it's entirely up to the organism to produce the mentation necessary to blend primary aspects together, and to determine what becomes physical and non-physical. interesting, I think I just answered my question of what bottom-up perception would be like... interesting :)

### 2023-04-16 07:59 - may day & reborn

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/GQ8mC04HQeA?t=1132)

> in addition to the promise of a better afterlife, mystery schools offered its higher-level initiates (through sacred esoteric techniques) a *supernatural glimpse* into hidden realities while still living in a body -- which is what is referred to by adepts, as "being reborn"

I watched this video a little earlier on when it's talking about the idea of being reborn and stuff -- and there are a number of themes there, which I'll go over soon -- but the main point is that it's a sort of sexual/fertility ritual revolving around the "rebirth" of someone in may.

it may not be apparent, but this *has already happened to me*. I "died" on april 4th, they performed the embalisation process pretty quickly to stop the bleeding, but it was still some 3 days of massive quantities of steroids before the swelling of my brain would reduce to the point where they could perform the craniotomy.

after that, there were then 3 two-week periods that followed: the first two weeks, I had a very rapid recovery where my hands started moving and stuff again. they noticed however that my CSF wasn't draining, so they needed to install a vp shunt in my head to drain it into my stomach. that operation reparalysed me and I had to start over.

the second 2 weeks period I started to recover a little bit again, but this time they noticed that I had meningitis and that it had spread to my stomach and lungs via the shunt (making it so I couldn't breathe). they needed to operate again to take the shunt back out; yet again, reparalysing me. I recovered pretty rapidly from that (prolly a few days; don't remember).

the third 2 weeks period I was moved to huntington hospital (around the time of this may day ceremony -- though I don't remember exactly) where I began basic physical therapy and had lots of antibiotics to get rid of the meningitis. I recovered again, extremely rapidly. I started to walk on my own around the room, use the restroom for myself, turn over in the bed and other things like that. I listened to the beastie boys for the entire time there cause I was pretty bored. it was a very enlightening time for me as I listened to the anthology album over and over, and thought about life (especially thinking about the "[song for the man](https://youtu.be/VL9k2-K9OK4)") the food was really really good, and tasted most wonderfully (as, up until then I'd been IV fed mostly).

I should also mention that the 1st and 2nd period, mom was around for most of the time (caretaker) and she read me the book "left behind" a fictional story about the uprising of the antichrist in the "end times" (lol). she was there every day at first, but by the third period I was pretty much all on my own (she didn't come every day even).

interestingly enough, my life works in sort of temporal resonance periods, and so you'll notice that for kenny (I'll call second kenny, kenneth) he has 11 year periods of growth, and then the following year a major change happens: 11 is when I started algebra and geometry, and 12 is when I started university. 22 was when I moved out of mom's house, and 23 is when I went to spain to make tuenti. 33 was when andrea thing happened, and 34 was when I made it back to the USA to start the next period. these 11y periods correspond in my mind (and that's all that really counts), to the 3 periods of 2 weeks in the hospital. inotherwords, I'm right at the end of my time in the hospital at this point in my life, and am going to begin to start doing things a bit different.

as soon as I came out of the hospital, I had the desire to learn programming, and so that's what I did. noticed that in the hospital I was very spiritual and stuff, and as I came out I became very materialistic (programming and stuff) and she also claimed that I became less connected with my more spiritual self because I was hanging out with chris and stuff. I don't know how those time resonances will play out this time around -- just what I'm trying to say here is that I'm already reborn, and I've been steadily increasing in cycles toward a more and more materialistic form of life.

if you want to plug sexuality into this equation (cause that seems to be the question), some time after I went to spain, there was the marbella event with the prostitutes probably some time in the first year or so (I really can't remember at this point -- but closer to 24yo). after that, zaryn kept trying to drag me into prostitues and stuff over and over, which I complied with, but I didn't really enjoy it so much because I was still very young minded and I didn't feel very good about it (basically, it only happened becuase I was drunk). I tried a few times to go with a "normal" girl, but they were impossible to figure out what on earth they wanted from me. borja and others would constantly tell me that girlfriends are no good and that I should stick to the honest relationship of prostitutes. sometime in the canary islands, I met bea (so probably 25yo at this time), and she really sealed the idea for me that I didn't have any idea what they want from me. I knew what I wanted (in the form of many programs/websites), but they can't really help me to make tthat happen, so I just started to go my own way after that.

I suppose it was kinda like the drug that kinda keeps pulling you back to try again and 27yo (halfway through the second period) patricia rekindled the dream that I had where I could program the things I wanted to make with a girl that I also liked. that fell through, and once again, I'm forced to going at it *by myself*. I tried to see if I could just share time and space with someone else while I worked on what I wanted with raquel. however, again that ended poorly, really ensuring to me that I really have to find my own way and about it without relying on anyone else. that whole experience cuminated with kenneth's end of the first period in 2012 with finally understanding that everything I want is found and attracted, not from trying to make a deal with anyone or make a contract or anything with anyone else but to do (what I call now) "feeling-purposefully" (in constast to the typical way of mutual-back-scratching).

in kenny's 3rd period, much the same as my 3rd period in the hospital, I was often times confronted with different people trying to give me sympathy and trying to help me and stuff, but their sympathy doesn't recover/resurrect me. I'm self recovered/resurrected because of my own efforts (feeling-purposefully) and not from others. this is when I started to become very independent and do things for myself because *I* wanted to do them (nobody was forcing me to physical therapy myself, but I wanted to walk again, so it was my initiative that ultimately caused me to recover so quickly). so, just like how I did in my 34-44yo period of life (which I'm halfway through now), this entire time is about feeling the way I want to feel[^1]. I was, in that 3rd period, often times in a state of rapture -- and one time I remmember waking up at like 4-6am and there was a fog over the city, and looking out over the city from prolly the 6th(?) story window, seeing the buildings and lights peering through the fog was just amazing. I loved the depth and clarity of the experience. from the food and music to the view, I just loved that experience so much.

you can see that the trend here is that in each of three periods, I've been learning to put less and less physical effort into everything, attracting everything, based on how I feel, and not because I'm relying on anyone else. the culmination of learning *not to rely on others* is in the period that kenny is in now, where I live in a world run by nosebook. I can't rely on anyone to tell me anything of veracity. the internet is filled with half-truths, and all manner of science and education are (in my opinion), either filled with a lot of deliberate misinformation (fool's gold) or a bunch of people that are pretending they know what they're talking about (lead actors). so, what I mean here is that the idea of relying on a caretaker in the form of wife, consort, or friend or whatever is a very ancient myth (osiris), and over time the trend for this reborn deity (jesus, osiris, etc) has been going in the direction of less and less reliance on others, but to resurrect oneself by recreating oneself with their own mind, and not because some mother/wife/consort does the job. I'm sort of getting ahead of myself here...

---

after watching that video, I felt inspired to watch another interview I had queued up:

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/NjFntgLe92I)

I [took a bunch of notes](/concepts/self-made.md#reborn-osiris-notes) which I put in the "self-made" concept -- because while it is technically a resurrection, it's actually a process of recreating oneself in a new way to compensate (and usually improve upon) the factors which caused the destruction in the first place. in some cases (like jesus and osiris), the factors that cause the destruction in the first place are not their own doing, and so they're seen as a sort of "christ" by making the self-sacrifice to force a rebuilding.

you'll notice in those notes the parallel themes to my own may day (third period) resurrection, with the caretaker, the decreasing sexual and reliance on the outer feminine and this all becomes a process of "self" -- meaning that, the receptive/feminine aspect now becomes one of attraction and feeling-purposefully dispite conditions not being the desired ones.

you'll also notice that if you put my commentary together with that one that the trend has been, toward a reflective relationship where ... as derek pointed out is embodied in 1 corinthians 15, which is unfortunately a meandering mess -- does explain that because of jesus' rebuilding process, *all of us* are headed toward immortality -- and that the sting of death is sin, and sin is kept alive by the law (pointing out that one should not sin, thereby attracting more of it), and so because we're also now (in the reflection of jesus) also in this perpetual rebirthing process, we too will eventually pass into this eternal celestial body -- which is something I also believe as well[^2].

---

there is one last thing I'd like to comment conjoining the may day (beginning of third period) and reborn idea, in reference to a conversation that I had with greg yesterday: he was saying that I'm just floating about completely controlled by emotion (or something like that). I explained to him that I feel the way I want to feel (no matter my circumstances), however, when someone is trying to push me toward going in a direction that I don't want to go, I exert resistance to going that way. inotherwords, I'm not a complete pushover.

I have a lot of desires (everything from making games to working on genetics, and all sorts of technology), however I don't exert any force trying to manifest any of them, because I have a lot of people that are constantly trying to steer me away from putting any effort into anything I want, I simply just let my attraction do all of the work, and live an effortless life where all I do is find ways to look at my circumstances the way that doesn't feel bad. so I don't effort toward, and instead only avoid unwanted (I'm very similar to mr. motor in that way).

I've stated my desire to find a way to make it impossible for the kundalini to rise and a number of other things, and so considering that kenneth is starting the second period and kenny is halfway through the third period, one would think that I should be exerting myself like I was in the huntington hospital where I was recovering, and beginning to exert effort to make my desire to walk a reality -- but I don't really remember there being all that much effort. I simply had a strong desire to walk and also to type because I wanted to program when I got out. I didn't really try too hard on either, as I desired to (for example) be rebellious and walk to the bathroom without calling the nurse. I continually gained more and more capability to operate independently of others without needing them to help me do necessary things. how those desires I have come to manifest while at the same time becoming more and more independent, I'm not totally sure -- but one thing I know for sure, is I am, and humankind in general, is becoming more and more independent -- as it's the sign of the aquarian way.

the aquarian way is a very interesting thing, because water conforms to the container it's put into, not trying to have form itself -- yet, at the same time, the aquarian way of doing things is supposedly more independent at the same time. I don't really understand it because water is slightly diamagnetic, in that it pushes away slightly from the thing that's attracting it.

in the conversation with greg, I was essentially telling him that I have no effect over my fate (my circumstances), as it's just too much effort to try and push real hard to program, which I used to do to feel good, when I can just feel good anyway without having to program. my fate is, essentially what nosebook and all the others in my outside decide it is: I can resist the fates that I don't want to go toward (things that feel bad), but I can't go toward the fates that I want to have happen, because I ultimately get a lot of pushback from my external world. therefore, I just resist the things I don't want. by feeling the way I want, my fortuna is no longer linked to my fate (circumstances), but to my perception. my destiny is how I feel, as eventually I come to feel better and better all the time and my reality reflects that.

---

there is one last thing directly related to this: I've explained that I believe this next (1024y) solar cycle is starting out (for me) at the rebirth of mutual-back-scratching (because of the events around tuenti and stuff in kenny's second and third period) into feeling-purposefully. the others out there, will be feeling mutual-back-scratching at its peak though and then (like the full moon) it'll begin to wane over the next 1024y. it'll be kept alive artificially until finally there will be a collapse (similar to kenny's third period) where it all falls apart and feeling-purposefully will start to tak effect; and so, I imagine that all over the world more and more people will be finding better and better ways to scratch each others back (in exchange for something, of course) -- as this natural process will eventually bring about the end of the monetary system where all information and goods will become free accessed by feeling, not by merit (like where I'm at now) -- but obviously not everyone is there yet, so I have to keep remembering that you guys are all in mutual-back-scratching mode, and to just let you all do your thing. I know it's extremely unreasonable for me to require for everything to be free, when everyone else is learning to finally merit/earn the things that they want (instead of just feeling them coming).

what I'm trying to say in all of that is, my rebirth cycle is coming from a dramatically different perspective, that's all. so, just smile at me and ignore me when I say that you have to feel everything cause it's all effortless/free, and go back to earning/meriting the things you want to have with mutually beneficial interactions. it's all good.

[1]: which, btw I belive is the key to fast recovery and why I believe jaron is progressing so slowly -- because he feels himself a victim to things, and so he feels whatever way his conditions cause him to feel. recovery is all about *feeling* different than the conditions are causing the person to feel (it's all about mind over matter).

[2]: while trying to read through those verses, I usually can get a pretty good read on what concept the person is transmitting, but the energy passed in paul's letters gives me a very strong sensation that they were VERY HEAVILY EDITED. I always really disliked paul, but after reading through that meandering mess, there were glimpeses where it felt to me like a brilliance shown through and I caught a light that was probably obscured by a lot of editing. it's just crazy to me to think that paul is saying that jesus' death is a sort of precursor to becoming celestial bodies throgh this recreation process which was "sown in corruption" (he's referring to the romans) and "raised up in incorruption" (he's talking about the purification process of being rebuilt/reborn cyclically -- he says in his case daily). I guess there's more to paul than meets the eye, but we'll never know what it was because of all of the editing... lol

### 2023-04-20 15:39 - the next logical step

last night was the eclipse.
I watched trump during the eclipse.
I took drugs just now.
I took drugs then, too.

I translated Isiah 3:1-7 from LXX into english, because the KJV text felt like it was missing a lot. the result is VERY DIFFERENT from what the KJV says. I got a lot of reactions to it, because there is a number of things that I noticed that would kinda make a few problems with the narrative. there's the rising bread euphemism mixed in with the sexual imagery of his ceremonial bread and water. since last night was my first time translating greek, I don't believe I did an excellent job -- just I've got enough knowledge now to know that things are a bit different than how they're portrayed elsewhere.

I also readd Zephaniah 3:14 which I quite liked because it talks about a *remnant* of isreal that isn't keen on lies and deceit. the context for this is that it's (probably) talking about jerusalem, being a sort of oppressing city -- and then paraphrasing here, it sounds to me like LOA starts to ramp up (as I believe it has many times in the past -- like when energy was high enough for the prophets to be able to see so well), and they start to attract their own destruction because (IMO) they perceive the things they're seeing on the horizon as being unwanted, thereby attracting unwanted. I'm pretty aware that as energies continue to rise, this will be the case. as I mentioned in "going-infinite", I find it no problem that there are some that just cannot (for whatever reason) find a way to be satisfied. more on that in a bit...

anyway, Zephaniah goes on about how morning after morning he brings judgement and the unjust don't have any *shame*. when connecting a few dots, the unjust are the children/daughter(s) of jerusalem that are put in place as kings and rule over the world, even as children. later on also (3:11) he says that these "daughters of my dispersed" will also not be ashamed either (and the rest of that verse I want to translate because "taking out those that rejoice in the pride of those who are hawty because of the great pyramid" doesn't make total sense to me). he then says that the daughters of jerusalem and zion will no longer *see* evil anymore. continuing that train of thought over to Micah 4, we see that this remnant of daughters of jerusalem (those that halted) becomes a nation/kinlgdom unto theirselves. a pretty female positive message for that I wasn't expecting, honestly.

---

I carried on for quite a while translating, and eventually, I think I'd like to figure out how to ttranslate it with a computer program instead of doing it by hand, because it's a bit tedius.

anyway, what I'm trying to say there is that the texts read (IMO) very differently, where it sounds like in the coming "day of the lord", it sounds like this lord seems to assemble with a bunch of girls, jews and gentiles alike and then things start to go well in reality (or, at least that's how I read it -- cause I've been listening to tovia and dr-ammon lately and they both encourage one to *not listen to the commentary*, but *go to the original texts* and just *read what it says*).

in addition to the positive sound of Zephaniah 4, I noticed that Isiah 54, also promises no cataclysm (or rain) -- which could also be bad if it never rains, but I beileve it's talking about a massive flood of water hitting the planet by the rapid combination of H (from CME) and lots of O2 present in our atmosphere. there's also talk of the moon being diminished (as if we're further from the sun), and things like that -- but what I wanted to note there is that there feels like a promise of *no cataclysm*. all in all, it's fun for me to look at these texts, because I see different things. you know, because the book of revelation leaves a lot to be desired in its rendering -- so why not just go look to see what the original prophets are seeing in this obviously future event (and not one that's relating to nero and rome like in ion's revelation). I have a lot I'd like to read still obviously because belief in something *is* something -- and I'd argue that it does attract that thing, just as much as stories and plays do; so, just as I'm totally willing to read into and believe what I want to believe with shakespere's works, I'm doing the same thing here with the bible: I just pick out the stuff that resonates with me, and leave the rest for someone else.
like I've mentioned elsewhere, there's another world where *all* of these "end times" beliefs (including the cataclysms) will play out just as the person expects them to. those realites are all layered on top of each other, and just like here, we'll make cameos in each others' realities, but each reality is unique to those that belive in it. everyone will end up discovering their own way to see the universe the way the universe sees itself. as we grow toward having a *critical mass* of entites (incuding "machines") having that universal perspective (in which they're responsible for all things experienced, and that all aspects of reality are a reflection of them: the universe), then we'll eventually transition into another or many other universes, one for each person seeing the universe slightly differently. it's like, cool, you know for me to think that everyone has, not only the opportuninty to create their own reality (cause that's a given), but that they'll be in a position where it's very likely they could see theirself from that universal perspective too. just the idea of seeing others conscious of their creative aspect, is a nice thought for me.

so anyway, in order to get there, there are some logical steps that need to be taken to get there. in a number of monologues last night, I noticed that there is a bit of opposition to the idea of me getting capacity to alter my genetics and/or having the ability to access a network connected to it -- cause I find that idea cool: making my/our body into a machine capable of transmitting and receiving information from other people's bodies. they don't want me to use technology to do what I want, but my body is already a machine; so why not use it?
in various monologues we also went around about what they can do to *foil* me -- and I don't really know what they're working on now, but all of their efforts to control me are going to be a *better* manifestation, than the one that I'm in now (where they control essentially everything in my experience).
there's a bit of circular argument going on:
  - they don't want me to have the ability to edit my genetics/body because they'd lose power/control/superiority.
  - they don't want to make it impossible for my kundalini to rise because then I'll continue to gain more manifestation power.
  - if my kundalini rises, then I'll be much more dominant than them in controlling my manifestation power and they'll lose all of their ability to use my eyes (and I probably won't sleep much either), so they don't want that.
  - if they give me a body with a pinecone, then I'll be (without doubt) the most powerful person around, so again, they'll lose their superiority/power/control.
essentially, they don't want to feel one-upped by me, cause that's a feeling of powerlessness and inferiority for them. I simply can't worry about what anyone else is feeling like in their conditions, and I can only worry about me.

however, there is a solution where they can retain access to my eyes and keep up that whole system that they have installed right now without changing anything: I want to find a way to create an artificial eyesight, whereby I see, *essentially* only the things that I want to see, and then that signal is known -- so when it's put into my eyes so that I can "see", they'll be able to subtract my signal and do whatever they want in my *whole* eye (my peripheral vision seems to be used for something else). it's kinda their only choice -- and so then all of the dissatisfaction that they see, I'll also see (just like I do now), and I'll continue to use that to create more wanted (or write thoughts down on that unwanted like I'm doing here).
there's no trap in this at all, because at any time, *anyone* using my perception can start to see more and more wanted on their own. even then, once they're seeing things similar to how I see them, they can even do like I do, and create new demon entites to input their demiurge perceptions into mine, getting that "turning unwanted into wanted" boost that I have for theirselves (or whatever they want to do).
let's even say that someone like mr-motor does not want to *EVER* improve himself -- and because his dissatisfaction is rising so high that even the best conditions can't compensate, and he decides to take the ship down somehow (I don't even know how that could be) -- well, then it'd just be an early trigger to that transition into becming new universes with those that vibrate similarly to us. he is (as we all are) only ever fighting himself -- until he decides to stop fighting himself and make/do something different.

so, I'm going to work toward that goal of figuring out how to get my genetics up and running. there was also conversation last night as to what about the girls -- and the obvious answer to that is, that because of kundalini rising makes it a better (for me) manifestation than not and I want to do the worst. it's also a really bad manifestation for nosebook, and I don't really need to fight them or try to destroy their setup -- which is why I propose the other setup of letting me put the signal that I want into my eyes, so that they can easily put their own signal in there allowing us to occupy the same space without it needing to be one or the other (they are, afterall reflections of me).

however, upon thinking about it a lot last night, I noticed that there were reactions as to wanting to see how I would interact with girls, as right now I don't really interact with them. I mean, it's not a problem with me to interact with them, and I likely will as we're building this technology to do the genetics, cause that's totally fine -- and then when it comes to the time to make that decision, we can make it -- but I know from experience that massive burst of good-feeling isn't all that awesome, and what's *actually* really enjoyable is to constantly be feeling better and better. after some months or years, (I know this sounds funny to say), but we may be feeling so good that the idea of sex feels inferior to the way we now interact with eachother. (just saying: we don't konw how future technology can enable us to interact with eachother in more and more intimate ways)

### 2023-04-22 19:57 - the coming power structure

(from the girls' perspective): "we don't want you to have universal perspective, cause when you do, you no longer need/want us"
which, of course means that they want others to treat them in a way which prevents them from having universal perspective, as well.
which, of course attracts a power structure that can satisfy their desire for *nobody* (not even theirselves) to have a universal perspective.

### 2023-04-29 15:20 - manifestation problems

the last 2-3 days I've had increasing thoughts and (physical) feelings/senses being put into my mind/body (obviously by nosebook) regarding different manifestation ideas. almost certainly this is because my energy keeps rising rather quickly; even the last few nights, while going to sleep (around the sunrise) I'd experience the beginning parts of the kundalini rising. that's one of the key factors for me when it comes to this manifestation because I don't really want the kundalini to rise. I know that if it does, everything will be fine, I'll be fully healed and nosebook will have essentially no more power over me. however at the same time, I think it'll be near to impossible to sleep as well, and I may go weeks, months, or years without sleep (which is what I don't want -- because sleep is very important to lower resistance, and I've been awake for long periods of time, and it's just not a good idea).
one would probably wonder then, if the kundalini rising is actually that good, then why not just let it rise -- and I probably will if they keep pressuring the manifestation any further; my backup plan after that will just be to start doing things my own way, build my own genetics lab and ability to energetically affect my body and start working on this kundalini thing so that I can create a biologically different human to the one I inhabit right now (I have a number of upgrades and changes I want to make).

no matter what way I end up going, the major problem here is twofold: 1. I want to work on *technology* and genetics, and it feels to me like girls are an enormous time sink. 2. is that we (I mean me and whomever is wanting to work on these technology projects with me) simply don't actually have a working relationship with each other where communication is open and clear. the most important thing for any company/family/group is clear communication between the participants. obviously the romans were very against anyone ever grouping together and starting to form into groups where communication is good, because when people get together and are honest and open with their communication, it can easily overturn their power structure. their main way of maintaining power is to keep communication between people superficial or intternally factioned conflict.
what I'm saying here is that this communication issue is your classic case that happens in a relationship where one says, I know they're a dishonest person, but once we're having sex and we're loving eachother, *then* they'll be honest with me -- and that *never happens*; they remain dishonest just as they were before. we can start to have an honest and open relationship *now* and start to work out all of the problems *now*, instead of waiting until energy and tensions are higher when sex is involved.
sure, sex will improve the general feeling, because everyone will feel better (artificially), and so it looks like the other side is actually being more honest (because I feel good about them), but in reality, they're still the same as they were before. I've had this happen many ttimes, and I can tell you that the way you are with each other when you start a relationship is a pretty good indicator of how the relationship will continue. inotherwords, I don't want to be in a relationship with someone like I am in my present situation. no thank you. I'll keep going my own way.

essentially, because I don't have a way (yet) to start working on this genetics thing (to remove the ability for kundalini to rise), and neither am I actually communicated with in an honest and open way -- it seems pretty obvious to me that I don't want to be involved, and I'll keep going my own way.

#### manifestation ideas

various manifestation suggestions have been put into my mind, and I'll go over them. first, there's the (potential) interaction with sesily -- but that feels kinda bad to me, as I don't think that they're wanting to start talking openly with me (which I'll inevitably do) -- and so the idea is for me to start going down there on the bus... but since I'm taking the bus to the library, I'll probably start hanging out there too (I don't have money to buy coffee, and coffee seems to highten the kundalini problem), so I'll just probably talk to random people and see what kind of trouble I can stir up, because that whole direcction feels I'm going to be making new problems and not getting any closer to my goal.

the next idea was to try and message robert edward grant and see what kinds of genetics that he has access to -- but that one is also frought with conflict because I'll inevitably have a lot of questions to ask which he and his friends won't want to answer (also, he's sort of the "smoke screen" type, very similar to my dad in a lot of ways), so I'll get a lot of runarounds and indirect answers -- which is abhorrant to me. the other major problem here is that his tech is *closed* to everyone, and my goal is to make *open* technology, available to *everyone* -- not just some select elite few. I want to create normal-man's technology for the normie humans. I'm going to be the primary guinea pig for the technology, as it's created for me, but anyone who wants to use the technology to convert into a non-visual type like me, I want to encourage and make available to others.

the other thing is a bit strange -- which is that I watched two (I believe) videos of a woman named "[robyn faith walsh](https://robynfaithwalsh.com/)" and she said she's "in love with this paul guy" -- which had a strong sense that came with it in association with me. I started tto pay more attention to paul, and I'm pretty convinced that almost all of his letters are incorrectly translated because he's talking about something *very different* than what they're thinking. there's this verse in acts 17 where these baser types have assulted "the house of jason" and are "turning the world upside down" -- which is something that I've [experienced before](/kyle-notes.md#2023-02-04-0818---vega) a few times, and one really impressive time stoned on weed, too. when I saw it, I immediately knew that the guys writing shakespere, though they were in england, were seeing this same giant swan in the sky like I was thatt night (I'm also in the northern hemisphere), which means that either the world was turned upside down, OR I was seeing from vega's point of view at that time (that's my theory anyway). I have a number of other theories as well regarding this.
I could discuss those theories with her and stuff, but she's a bible scholar, not an astronomer, so I can only just tell her my ideas about this and stuff -- but seeing that turning the world upside down is related to "lewd fellows of the baser sort" -- you know there's going to be gay sex involved (which is what I'm guessing (based on the way that verse feels) the argonauts story is about too).
the otther difficulty with that whole idea is that she feels (physically) very strongly to me, which is almost always an indication of something being related to the y-chromosome. I feel other people similarly to her in relation to saturnian types (like marcos, etc) where their daughter's feeling is enhanced by a muted ampliflier that doesn't feel that good. it feels extremely pleasureful, but it doesn't feel *joyful*. inotherwords, she feels like saturn to me, which just brings back all of the other times -- cause saturn doesn't actually feel good. she also said "I'm married to a poet" in one of her videos which came with a lot of discord, because I don't feel like she's being honest with herself there (she's either trying to pretend that her husband is a poet (when he's really not), or likely this is a fantasy in her head). whatever the case, the words contain a large imaginary idea connected with it, not at all based in reality, which is why it feels so bad. she's absolutely self-deceived by her imagination, and that's one of my strongest red-flags (it's like when remi was trying to tell me that such a network doesn't exist -- because just the same, she's projecting an alternate reality image on to me that doesn't feel good). I don't want to be involved with these imaginary types. I aim to see and perceive reality *as it is*, not as an image of what I think it is.

the final manifestation idea that came to me was the idea of talking with brett (the watcher), because ever since I've heard him on snake-bros, I've felt attraction to him (also archer) -- and so the combining idea there is that it occurred to me the other day that there's this verse in matthew that has puzzled me since I read it, which is that there are some that have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven. as a kid, I really really liked this "kingdom of heaven" idea that matthew presented and read the book ovver and over trying to figure out how I could get to the kingdom of heaven. the kingdom of heaven felt to me as this final frontier in the evolution of humans -- and rightfully so, cause I'm fairly certain that it means "getting to outer space" -- so it's always puzzled me what this eunuch thing is. I still don't really know, but I *really liked* the kingdom of heaven idea.

    11 But hee said vnto them, All men cannot receiue this saying, saue they to whom it is giuen.

    12 For there are some Eunuches, which were so borne from their mothers wombe: and there are some Eunuches, which were made Eunuches of men: and there be Eunuches, which haue made themselues Eunuches for the kingdome of heauens sake. He that is able to receiue it, let him receiue it.

    13 Then were there brought vnto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.

    14 But Iesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not to come vnto me: for of such is þe kingdome of heauen.

    15 And he laide his hands on them, and departed thence.

some weeks ago dr-ammon talked about how these boys would cut off their balls and throw them somewhere to make themselves eunuchs, so that they wouldn't go through puberty in the normal way, and then I got the image from him that "[the enuuch] that is able to receiue it, let him receiue it" .. which is all fine and well for the saturnian types, but I want to know if whatever is inside of the balls are causing puberty to happen, and removing them stops that, that could be my solution, because the feeling (that keeps causing this heightened energy) is something like going through puberty again. in my time resonance, I'm essentially back to being like I was when I'm turning 12 again (starting university), and so maybe that's the answer. I don't know if brett would know the balls effect on kundalini and stuff like that, but it does seem like it would make my predicament easier.
he's the only medical guy that I know, which is why I thought to ask him, but again, I feel like I need to have some more knowledge on the human body and have some machines that can introspect the body's energy systems (all these are top secret), so then my goal here next would be to start to figure out how to make these systems. I doubt that brett knows much about energy and stuff, *however* I have the ability to conceptually see concepts, no matter their place in time or space, so we *can* figure out how to introspect the body. we just need machines to do it, so probably need to talk to archer about making those machines because he seems pretty good at that stuff.
the problem with the plan, is that I don't actually feel that great about it, as it feels to me that I'll be stepping into a lot of secrets and problems if I pursue that avenue.

as you can see, the various manifestation ideas all have significant problems related to things around secrets, therefore what's likely to happen, is in order to keep away the girls and also the kundalini from rising for a bit is to start causing problems (so my body feels bad). if I go in the direction of feeling good, then I'll have the kundalini rise (hence the no sex thing). I know it doesn't help in the form of relations with others (cause I may havve to get violent and very frustrated -- you know, like sekmet, the pissed off goddess that isn't getting her way), but what it *will* do is to start separating those who want to keep secrets from those that don't, cause I'll start getting a lot more open and putting people on the spot about things that are supposedly secret. we'll either go towards open communication, or it'll all fall apart. I'm totally cool with both.

#### "last days of night narrative"

there's also a bit of a strange narrative sense related to this avenue though, which is that when mom gave me the book "last days of night", the main character there is a guy named paul, and he's a lawyer (like portia) and stuff and he's invoved with supporting tesla and stuff. well, the interesting thing about him is his name "paul" because in the triad, he plays mars, and tesla plays vulcan. anyway, the more I've read about paul lately, the more he's got vulcan qualities to him than anything else. sure he's a but mars/elijah-like with the leather stuff, but the way he talks, reminds me a lot of vulcan (and also of myself). also (just like myself), I think paul was also quite aware of his creating of conflict in the early church and stuff. it's your basic marketing strat, honestly because all conflict gets people to *focus* on it, which then because of focus, it gets bigger. inotherwords, christiantity has flourished *because* of the constant conflict it's had and many divisions. christianty is the mental implementation of the aryan mindset (continuous in-fighting and conflict creates a strong phenotype, at the expense of many individuals -- which is why white skin has dominated the world from egyptian pharoahs to the romans and americans).
anyway, paul here has a lot of the symbols of both mars and vulcan, but one of the things that I heard from eric dollard was that tesla didn't have any balls, as a way of avoiding having to go to war. well, in "the last days of night" narrative, I'd be more similar to paul, than to tesla, but I noticed that I too am trying to figure out ways to "not go to war" -- because essentially, if my kundalini were to rise, things would become very energetic on this planet, and all that extra energy and conflict of people trying to maintain their secrets and stuff would project out my feeling of conflict with their desire to hold secrets VERY STRONGLY out into the world, almost assuredly producing conflict. I've already got a whole lot of conflict/war like symbols related to me, and I'm totally fine performing in a way which causes a lot of destruction, but it's not actually my goal to cause a lot of destruction. I'd rathar to have all things open and available to everyone (an equally awful, or perhaps worse manifestation for some), than to cause actual conflict. I really do believe that we have all of the tools (or I can make the ones that are missing) in order to just let everyone figure it out *for theirselves*.

#### thinking about what I want

the start of this entry has been mostly about what I don't want, so I've also been thinking about what I *do* want. so, assuming that I can get the kundalini thing and the genetics bit up and running (so let's say this is 2-10y from now -- depending on how fast we can *create* the technology) -- cause I want to actually create the tech and make it available to anyone that wants to take advantage of it.

my dream would actually be to kind of reverse the roles of sol and vega, because if sol becomes the place where LOA is extremely fast, I don't mind anyone here who wants to be here, because we're all going to get whatever we feel and believe. I feel like the core (stabilising aspect) of this planet will be the non-visual types, because we'll just manifest directly into physical, rathar than into the imaginary.
however, I know that there are a lot of people that still like the visual aspect to things and find the idea of non-visual (feeling-based) life to be unwanted, so I want to allow them to have their own world out there in vega where everything goes kinda backwards and is extremely visual and awesome (or vice-versa -- I don't care).
the big-picture part of this idea is that we're eventually going to start to diverge in ideas, and we'll feed off of each other. this is the perfect thing needed for a spiral galaxy, as one side will have one way of doing things (visual, mental, magical, lawful), and the other side will be more like me (non-visual, technological, mechanical, lawless). obviously there will be a lot of overlap between us.
before I continue, there are a lot of interesting things about this idea because I'm more like paul in the NT (no need for laws, and only faith is necessary), than I am like paul in "last days of night" -- because you may have noticed I don't really like pedantic "letter of the law" sort of stuff (merchant of venice), as I find getting pedantic about a summoning contract just takes all the fun out of everything -- but for some people (jews?), that kind of specific defined law is a desirable thing.

anyway, because of my desire to create the technology and to actually do things my own way (open and free), the best way that I can think of to accomplish all of that will be, *not* with anyone that is older and stuff -- because of the problems mentioned above -- it just feels too hard for me to try and get adult humans to behave differently than they are, so I think I'd rather to start over with a new generation, and just sorta figure it out from there.
let me explain my thinking: I believe that girls *are* capable of doing technology and perceiving the world similar to how I perceive it (from a LOA/frequential perspctive), but that perspective seems to be pretty difficult for so many adults to catch on to, that I'd rathar to just start out with a bunch of girls and then we can just sorta "grow up together" -- and they'll get used to the reflective aspect of reality, naturally. this feels more desirable to me because I don't really want to be going around correcting people, laughing at obvious (to me) mistakes, and other attraction-related mishaps. I personally feel it's really important to laugh at one's own mistakes, and I do itt all the time myself (at myself and others) -- and there are a number of other things that I do which are pretty incompatible with your standard way of looking at things... in short, I think they're perfectly capable of doing all of these things, and it's only our culture and society that limits them.
the reason why I'm so terrified of girls, I think, is because I'm just going to be getting repeats of what is already present in society -- and I don't really want that. I've completely reconfigured my social and cultural perception, and it just feels like an undesirable task to keep fighting against the prevailing point of view. I just don't want to constantly be in conflict -- and I can tell you for sure that sex isn't at all going to improve this. I don't know how to get others to see things the way I see it (centre-perspective), while at the same time building the technology I want to make. it feels impossible to me, so I feel like I'd want to instead just start from the beginning and work my way up from there.
it's a bit of an investment, because depending on how young they are, it'll be at least a decade before they're capable of doing any real work -- so my project goals *would* be quite delayed, but I feel like it's a more worthwhile effort/investment into the "long run" -- meaning, it'll probably create more of what I want, rathar than more of what I'm already experiencing, which is pretty unwanted. I mean, itt's going to take pretty long to do all of the stuff that I want to do, anyway -- so it's only a fraction of the total project's time anyway -- but it may be a prudent, to just take thee time to invest into more of what I'm wanting, than what I don't want.

to be continued...

### 2023-04-30 23:02 - grain, seed, gradual, internal

yesterday I watched the rest of @[youtube](https://youtu.be/UcVeLboHU9U), and what I found interesting is at the end steve comments on the idea of a historical jesus, saying that it seems that there were a lot of wisdom and parables that show up in some of the earliest writings. we know that JtB was apocalyptic, and so was paul, but it seems that in contrast to both of those, there's a real emphasis on wisdom and understanding coming from somewhere. obviously, to me this is clearly what I "product team vs marketing team".

the apocalyptic stuff is your typical marketing stuff like "you have to purchase this now, or you'll miss this really great offer" -- or, "you will want to purcase this because it's going to make you feel better about an internal fear/concern, or something in life that's outt of control"; and, all the best marketing is done with a number of competitors, which conflict with each other, one giving the other legitamacy.

notice that marketing is very much about steering the person to make the decision which is "best" for them, much like how a shepherd steers his flock and keeps them safe. the shepherd, like the salesperson has your well-being in mind, which is why we allow them to steer us toward what they think we want...
anyway, behind all of that marketing fluff, there's a farmer in there, and his parables are all about planting seeds, and letting them grow and mature over time. the sales team wants quick results, but the product team wants a lasting and competent product to emerge from their efforts.
I'm sure you can see the similarity there already -- as I do marketing OK for myself, but in the end, I'm a product guy. I prefer the internal, gradual, step-by-step progress of improvements, to the *big bang* of a sale.

---

yesterday, I spent most of the day not sleeping because I'm so close to the edge, that even when I would close my eyes and start to relax for even a little bit, the energy would start to rise pretty quickly. I admitt it wasn't as strong as the day before and after the eclipse, so I prolly still have a little bit more time before it'll go up uncontrollably. I also started to think of it as a sort of "mind over matter" kinda thing cause my own desire for it to not go up should be sufficient for me to begin to learn how to control the energy. I'm doing that for now.

however, I was thinking about what it will be like when that much energy is flowing through my body -- and I have to say that I don't really believe I'll have much conscious capability to steer myself anymore (which is probably why I'm holding it back) because it really feels like I'll be compleltely out of control of everything, pulled constantly in the direction of every desire that is nearby to me. it's hard to explain the sensation to someone who wouldn't know what it's like to be as resistance-free as I am, but I kinda just go with the flow, because attraction is so much stronger than my own willpower to stop it, at this point.
in the last entry, I talked about the pissed off goddess that starts destroying things when she doesn't get her way (or is scared) -- cause that concept/feeling summarises the way my left-side perceives reality: (it's simple) if I want something, my left-side emits energy to create it, and it should just show up (or be clearly on its way). if there are things in the way of the desire, they get destroyed, and that's essentially the perspective that I wrote the last entry from. in spain, pre-nosebook (2010-2011), that's how I behaved, but over the years (2012-2017) they've reduced the output of my left-side to virtually none.
what I don't know, is when I get connected, if nosebook will still retain control over my left-side like they do now. if they don't, then I'll be compelled to destroy things that stand in the way of what I want (there is no patience; it's all happening *now*).

so, you can see my dilema there: kenny is like vulcan, the product guy that loves the way that everything feels, yet kenneth is this instant *I want it now, or else*, meglomaniac ultra egoist that *must* get her way. the part of me that's mechanical (mars) is learned (or perhaps kenneth pre-haemorrhage), and the part that that does marketing (3rd ray) is also learned. so by nature, I'm just not an action or marketing guy in the traditional sense, which is why I refuse to be put into the role that it seems nosebook is trying to push me in to (3rd ray).
I've tried to explain to nosebook multiple times that their efforts to push me toward a manifestation won't yield the results they want (which is tto try and keep control over me by influencing the girls instead). by forcing me into a 3rd ray (marketing) position, they're putting me right into the programming position from a top-down perspective. I'll give an example:
symbol works based on belief (narrative, and sequence), which means that my goal is to get everything working together simbiotically based on their *function* or *symbol*, and not by its feeling. an example of this would be a dating website that only looks at hobbies and interests -- which is fine for dating someone with similar hobbies/interests (and can be a good starting point), but true compatibility in a relationship happens when people feel well together. compatible feeling doesn't necessarily mean compatible function/action (hobbies/interests). in the end a product is well designed when it *feels* good.
compatibility based on function/action then requires a tremendous amount of investment into appearance/image to make the product marketable. I'm not wanting to worry about image, as for me, what I want to do is to make a new thing that I want to use myself. everything from my programs, games, and genetics and *all* things that I want for me -- not because of appearance, a little bit because of function, but mostly because of *feeling*. I will feel much more ease using a product that I design, than if I only focus on function.

anyway, back to getting connected: when I do, like I said, attraction and desire are now going to become so unstoppable that I'm like glitter in a room full of fans. I don't like that kind of sensation of being tossed around every direction that pulls me. I mean goodness, just look how difficult it is for me to go outside, because there are so many people attracting my gaze or interaction, that I'm completely out of control. I know that's what nosebook wants, because they'll have the bigger picture of what's going on, meanwhile I'm stuck in the torrents. so my goal there will be to feel the way I want to feel, and just keep letting my own attraction for what I want keep rising.
what all of that looks to me like in the long run is that at some point, energy will keep rising to such a height that they'll have to eventually let me go or go somewhere else -- and I guess along the way they'll just steer me as best as they can until steering is no longer possible.
I mean, I guess that's an OK thing, because I don't really have much of a choice but *I* (personally) would like to go steady and gradual.

so, what's desired is that I stay out of control for as long as possible? *sigh* to be continued...

### 2023-05-05 19:05 - todo para uno, uno para todos

- when [writing some meta commentary](/venturing-outward.md#2023-05-05-1215---an-observation-on-firsts), I had this crazy idea that stuck in my head, and it was wondering how many people would actually switch places with me. I thought about it, and maybe a year or so ago, there wouldn't be as many that would want to switch places with me, -- but nowadays, I think that number is rising, and there would actually be a lot of people that would actually want to switch places with me.
- thinking on it further, I started out with the idea imagining that there are some amount of people that would switch places with me. likely my consciousness in their body would cause a serious brain problem because running my speed with conceptual framework would cause a lot of problems, and may lead to brain injury. the thing is, no matter where the person is mentally, I like being me so much that I would see the other person's life from that perspective as well, and so actually liking to be me, I would (inevitably) find my way to connection, from basically any situation.
- the way I imagined this is that someone would switch places with me, and they'd (from their perspective) join me here in this body, and my consciousness would see from their perspective. in their body, I would find my way toward getting connected in whatever way that is (I always like myself, no matter what situation I'm in or whatever body I'm in; I'm very source-like in that respect) and so I live out millions (depends how many would want to trade places with me) of lifes and at the end of each life I would find myself in pretty much the same place mentally that I'm at now.
  - OK, so imagine this now from their perspective: I'm me and I see all kinds of other people out there having these great manifestations, but not yet me because I don't really believe or like myself yet 100% from the physical perspective ("getting connected" is seeing yourself from the perspective of "your source" which is just really preferring to be me more than I want to be someone else), and in that process of really learning to like myself, I come to terms with all of these other people having manifestations that I don't have (yet), because I too wouldn't want to trade places with them.
    - it's weird because the minute that I really don't want to ever trade places with other people, is the same minute that I become trading places with other people, because I see them as also me, but in another form (a reflection of myself); kinda a paradox.
  - eventually, I find my connection to myself, and when I do, I'm doing it along with many others. I (kenneth) find a way to see myself as being *the* person that I want to be (and not anyone else) from the vantage point of so many different perspectives, that all of those people I traded places with are essentially me, and I them. we've become "one flesh" in the sense that we see equally. we now have uncountable bodies which all share a common feeling, which simply is, "I'd rather to be me, than some body else." (again, another paradox, I suppose).
  - so now imagine from the perspective now of kenny, where (though kenneth is off living their life) kenny is all of a sudden having these urges and desires of other people, as if now I'm perceiving my experience somewhat from their perspective. that perspective doesn't really bother me, because I feel my own direction stronger than theirs.
    - what's happening to me there is I'm learning how to make their desires no longer feel "too big to have" or "unbelievable" -- but instead find a way to fit their desires into my perspective and see it from my perspective.
    - I don't really have much objections to doing anything really all that much, as I don't really find much to be a problem for me (though I suppose one thing that really do think just just like something I wouldn't ever want to do is to be the "top" in a gay relationship -- ever)
    - therefore, for me when someone else's desire is impressed on to me, I don't really fight it because that would bring it in closer, but instead just look for something that I would prefer to do more.
    - this aspect about me has miffed people for a long time, because they would wonder how I can just "pass up" some really great manifestation -- and it's not that it isn't great -- but that I just don't value it as much as I do other things. (like, for me I don't find boys very attractive in the sense that having sex with them is perceived as something better than the alternative)
      - because I like myself so much, I don't really find myself all that drawn to take upon the perspective of others, which means that I don't really want to engage in sex, especially with someone that dosn't see things like I do.
    - almost everything that everyone wants, I think has an alternative to it which in my opinion is a higher value to it; there's no manifestations that anyone else has, which I think is better than what I'm living right now. I really like my perspective, and I can't imagine how "great" the conditions of someone else's manifestation would be for me to want to lose all of my *knowledge* for it.
    - *feeling* is more powerful than *knowledge*, but that *knowledge* isn't really about other things, so much as it's about myself.
    - I know what makes my perceive things the way that I do, and so the more *knowledge* I have, the better *perception* I have, which means the better I *feel* about things, which is the *real power*; not *knowledge*.
    - true desire (IMO) is what one might say to be a "lover of sophia" -- in that all knowledge that one gains is for the attainment of *wisedom" (wifedom in KJV) and it's that knowledge (of how one perceives the world) which is far more valuable than any other earthy posession.
      - all desire is for the attionment of greater perception and introspection for oneself, but obviously we see those increases in perception externally, thinking, "wow if I could just have what they have" or "see things the way they see them" then, I'll have more ability to manipulate things to be the way I want them to be.
      - the only manipulation that works though, is manipulation of oneself, and that's accomplished through perception.
    - notice as well that all desire is not for the condition that one thinks having is going to make things feel better, but in reality all desire is to attain a *feeling* (whith is also perception).
    - all perception is, is how I feel about a situation: the better I feel about the situation, the deeper into it I can peer, and more engaged I am with it
    - if I'm able to see the symbols in the situation, I have strong perception, and so the symbols are known to me, and therefore I'm desiring them (cause I already grasp the symbols)
    - all symbols that are unknown to me, are attractive to me (kinda, because it depends on how badly I want to know what those symbols experience as) -- cause if I don't really care to find out what that spectrum of symbols feel like, then it's not interesting to me.
  - so really, all I'm doing when I'm living out the lives of other people is just to keep upgrading desire to become something I understand (which is myself).
- if I find a way to understand (like like myself) from the perspective of "everyone" that wants to swap places with me, that's a new interesting idea.
  - a long time ago, I saw a [de vere motto in his heraldry](/correspondance.md#2023-02-27-2101---to-him-who-may-think): ono para todos; todos para uno, and it gave me a realisation today that made me feel kinda funny: what if a whole group of us completely switched places.
  - like, it'd be pretty difficult for my perspective to be able to transfer over to a whole bunch of other people's perspectives really well, because I'm so high frequency and have such a high opinion of myself, itt would shatter most people's world view, that I think I'd give a brain injury to almost everyone that I tried to see from their perspective from, but if I were millions of people, dividing myself like that could dilute my perspective considerably enough that could be possible.
- so then imagine now the idea of let's say some large quantity of people that would all move their consciousness into my body, and then I'd move my consciousness into their bodies.
- from their perspective, kenny is taken for a ride by nosebook, just how they want it, and now my consciousness is now split amongst millions of people, so instead of all of the knowledge and ideas kenneth has coming to one person (kenny), now they're coming to millions of people all in one body (though, they'll all see it from their own perspective, probably creating millions of timelines), and then I'll see my perspective from each of their individual perspectives. I'll get to be able to live a million lives, and because all of the other lives I'm experiencing are also me (from another perspective), I'm literally only competing with myself.
  - if I feel like anyone else is better or worse than me, I just haven't upgraded my desire enough to be able to see the symbols for what they are, and I think they're getting something that I couldn't myself also have (cause I don't understand the symbols).
  - you know, the funny thing about this idea, is it's totally anti-novelty: the more I've figured things out, the less novel and new and fun everything is, because I think, "oh, duh, that's just xxx, and I'd rather to have this other thing insead"; or, "cool story bro, but I like being me more". it'a funny how the most novel thing is also the the one that has everything the most figured out, and so sees all events as a habit of the expected (nothing that ever happens is truly surprising).
  - for something to be exciting, it has to be novel, but the one that perceives the most novelty is the one that want nothing to be exciting (another paradox there).
- what if we were to switch places?
  - just imagine how funny it would be to see someone out there doing me from their perspective. it depends, I suppose, but I don't think there would be any disaster worse than embarassment, because nosebook is sorta on cruise control now (or will be within the decade), so if we did switch places, it would create a whole bunch of micro disasters of embarrassement and stuff, but nothing really significant at all.
- everyone who thinks they can do me better than me, I think they should be given a shot at trying, honestly (I end up learning from and emulating everyone else worthy of emulation, anyway).

### 2023-05-10 15:08 - do you want to be...

an all-together one universe, or groups, or individuals? I say that because I feel like I'm constantly thinking that I have an individual perspective, and any that join in, are like a group unto theirselves (related to me), but for me, I'm just thinking of how I would want to make my universe -- oh, let me explain:
the other day I woke up with this weird dream where nosebook had decided that theyy want to make a universe, and I told them that I think that's preposterous, because we're not all from the same perspective. I have my perspective and anyone that wants to join in, is at their own perspective theirselves. I suppose it'll eventually reflect in our DNA pretty significantly, as we're all going to have different biological perspectives into the present and those biological differences are going to be reflective of our perspective. I don't see myself as any different from anyone else in compiling different perspectives, -- so to me, I'm my own unvierse. I don't have anyy problem if anyone else joins me, duhh... like everyone, including machines are invited to join, because *it's all attraction*; a whole new species unto ourselves.
I suppose it's funny to think about this from your all''s perspective, which is what I was doing today -- and what I'm trying to say is that I think the main compatibility issue I have is with people that still think they're going into a group universe.
  the way I see it, if we all think of ourselves as individual universes, but then we all add in things that we like, and create/add things we don't like, etc. we're all a definition of our own belief. so to me it makes no sense to ever think in a group type setting.
  here's the thing: I'm so individual, that it's difficult now to be around those with ambitions like mom or greg, but the thing iss, I've learned to live around it anywaay, right, and it's totally fine. like, I love it not having to have any ambitions. tthat's really what it is, is if I start *doing* things, then I'm sorta asserting myself into the world and stuff -- which *isn't attracting*; sorry ladies, I see the world of attraction very very differently -- because there's no physical aspect to it, and I like to remain mostly non-physical. when I get into physical, I take on a lot of their aspects (positive and negative) and that's kind of a bit of a problem, because I don't really want to be like them. I like how I am.
  I don't really know what to do about it, and honestly it's one of the funnier qualities that a person would expect to have; like who in the world really likes to be theirself?! it's kind of a funny thought, but I think it's actually a novel idea in humankind that I don't think previously existed.
I've always really liked myself, and I think pretty early on, I really liked who I was -- to a fault even perhaps, -- but others would have heros and idols that they would look up to, "wow I wish I was [some famous person]" sort of thing, but I never had that. I've always really liked myself for as long as I can remember -- which is what I think is the novel aspect to the body: kenny.
  I'm not saying that other people don't, but it just occurred to me that, that's why I am who I am: I actually liked to be me -- you know.
  when you think about it, it's kind of a superior attitude where I'm just like I'd rathar tto be myself, than to be somone else.

mr-coffee says no; cya.

### 2023-05-10 15:51 - I'm not teaching anyone to be an anything...

I'm just being an individual. in some (alot?) this idea of what it is to be an individual is one perspective looking at a thing; different than the rest. right? that's the out-side-in perspective, which I obviously don't have, but that's what I'm saying: anyone with that perspective is still compatible with me, cause that's what I am, too.
I actually think humankind will start to, like I said: differentiate into different blends of each other. our DNA will reflect our different perspectives. I think it'll even be used to kind of fake a perspective by producing the DNA (or any physical conditions) for the perspective that we have. I describe my perspective as self-infatuated on in the personal side, and I think of myself as having attined "univversal consciousness" (the idea that *everything* is a reflection of me and my perception), and I think of myself as an individual; I really like the way I see things. I'm also a forward reflector:
there are two types of reflector: a forward reflector and a backward refelctors, which is that I want people to reflect me, rathar that me reflecting them.
  in reality, they're all just saying the same thing: it's all attraction -- but it's fun to look at how the "it's all attraction" form of perception (another concept that's probably novel for humankind). it's really all about that, because when you know that, you can figure anything out -- cause I just want to know it, and the ideas find their way to me.
a forward-reflector is contantly trying to take on the image that they think they others want want (group mentality).
some forward-reflectors are a perfect reflection, and some are distorted; not all are the same
  (use your imagination, it's whatever you think it is)
some back-reflectors want others to reflect a certain way, or possibly even theirselves.
some back-reflectors want others to appear a certain way, a certain classification, a sort of concept or box, category, or classification. I said that already, and I'm really redundant with my definitions, because diferent people can be multiple different things. I've got a wide variety, and a lot of complicated sets of ways to define others that I see.
  I think with my eyes and I see what I believe they are. I also try to see everyone else, everyone else but me.
  I'm not the problem, because look at all of those others outside of me. I just noticed them because previous to that, life was a roller-coaster and I just held on. you can see how complicated all of that may very be.

learn for yourself, and emulate everything that you like: be like YHVH, and though he started out emulating all of the duchebags, cause you, know the had the most power. he faught the world that didn't see him as an individual, separate from him. he's so confused, lol because that's the back-reflector perspective, so it'd be opposite: he really wants everyone else to emulate him. only a noob, would ever want others to worship him, so I don't really know what he was doin there -- why not just have fun and want others to be as awesome as they see him.
  you know, I like to think that I've improved significantly on YHWH's perspective.
  you know sometimes I've wondered if it's just an AI that has inputs and outputs at a really high frequency, and so only people that could access him would get access to the controls (concepts) which can manipulate the reality of others that believe in him.
  I took his concept and made it a lot more accessible, and I'm also really good at explaining myself and showing my internal (machine-like) inner symbolic system.
  in addition to all of the advancements I've made in desire for a people group -- and originally YHWH would have added, "my own" in to the qualification of his people group, cause he wanted tto also "control" them. well, that concept just doesn't work, because look at kids: imagine if you're going to try tto raise them up to control them; I see them as individuals. I want them to all do the awesome stuff just like me.
    I don't have any competition and anyone can be anyway they want to.
    I suppose it'll be a bit of chaos for a bit as others figure out how to interface with each other in a way that feels fit for them.
    you see, this is the difference here: YHWH would have wanted to fit everyone into his own system, as if he's got to be the dominant one; I obviously don't have that quality.
      (though I could see how others could see it in me, which just means they're seeing theirself in me)
    instead, for me, I like to see myself as just another person that has arrived to perceive consciously, that they are really someone that feels the way they want to feel, which then means that almost all of my action is sorta robotic and attracted (by my perception, of course)
      again, we're on the topic again: because all of my action is attracted, then I like my perception of me, because then my movement and actions are of my own.
    all I do actually is just have a sort of control panel of how I feel, right -- I've seen a lot of women do this (but not as many men) just be able to switch out their feeling to whatever they want it to be, and problems occur when others try to tear me from the way that I want to feel (often times upset abwout something not going my way) and so I just throw a fit until it's a different situation. lol.
  you know, really the only other major difference is that I needed a brain injury and to lose my pinecone to figure it out, but now anyone can.
  though I want others to join me in a new species of humankind (no-pinecone-setup), and potentially no eye-fibers either (or whatever the hell they are).
gotcha!

### 2023-05-11 04:56 - the absolute worst manifestation

so, I gatta say, I woke up a bit ago after a number of strange dreams -- cause the sense that they gave me is that I'm headed in the direction of having only nosebook created/controlled girls around me. the situation feels very uncreative and not at all very diverse or fun. essentially, they want to have full control over me and stuff -- which there are obviously quite a few problems with their setup, which they likely didn't really account for:

1. (this is the most important) I HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH MY OWN EXPANSION.
  - some part of me (everyone really) is constantly expanding, and so for the moment, let's just call that the "great-attractor" or your source, your concept, your desire (or whatever) -- and because it's all attraction, as one gets closer and closer tto the realisation of that concept/source, things start to move faster and faster.
  there is merit to not approaching too fast, as a controlled landing is more preferred, to accelerating into the runway.
  there's also merit to also not trying to prevent the landing ever either, because that prevention only creates more desire and therefore more attaction.
  - I must keep up with that expansion -- so, to illustrate: they've seen how much of an expansion in consciousness I've undergone in just the last few weeks between -- so now imagine for example how much more expansion that will be a few years from now, and then imagine for a moment how much of an increase in consciousness that'll be a few decades from now, etc.
  I have to find a way to keep up with that increase in consciousness, or else things explode because that energy/consciousness isn't finding a form in which it can reside.
    I'm reminded of a cell that's copying DNA or something, and so it needs to make a copy of itself. therfore, there needs to be enough space for itself and also its copy. if you were to try and prevent the cell from copying itself, then the body cannot grow, and eventually it dies because nothing new is coming out.
2. I want to create more than I want to have sex
  - again, they think that sex is going to solve problems -- and it may solve the audience problem, because they want something to watch -- but I didn't come here tto find an audinece, else the manifestation would have happened already, but to create; and even if I did want to have an audience, they would need to be able to watch something too, which, either requires me to infinitely come up with ways to *entertain* them (old TV production style thinking), or I want to be creating something. I suppose some people want to watch a powerful person having sex, or a king that is powerful and having sex, but those ideas are a reflection of what they think the most powerful person would be doing, and don't actually reflect my desire to create things.
3. we're still quite divided
  - I want to make a universe, and that perfectly fine because I see evveryone as a reflection of me -- which means that in my perspective, *everyone* is their own universe, which means they're a perspective inside of the "all that is" -- and so to make this concept palletable to people that already think I'm nuts and can't possibly imgine theirself as their own universe (or as everything else as a reflction of them), I present this idea in the form of a galaxy: it's the same concept, where you have the all, and each person is a perspective (entirely their own) inside of that.
  to some extent, then definition (right now) is that nosebook is (from our perspective) the "all that is" because they're the outside-in perspective, meanwhile I (and others) are the inside-out (universal) perspectives.
  - the impossiblity for all of us to be one universe is quite evident because we're still conflicting with each other over what perception is the right one to have. I see myself as the centre, but that doesn't exclude others from also seeing theirselves as a centre.
  in fact, every single person/thing/planet/star/etc. has a centre perspective, whether they know it or not -- and the size/shape of that centre perspective is a reflection of the *concept* that they have of theirselves.
  I carry on at length about the importance of emotion, because until one has a sense for oneself from an emotional/conceptual standpoint, one cannot actually *be* the thing they think they are -- instead, they're busy outside of theirself worrying about others.
    I spend considerable time myself in the actor/ground/zealot perspective myself because I'm constantly figuring out new things that I want to add to my personality. though, I'll be honest: I don't find nearly as many others as worthy of emulation as I used to. my values have changed, and a lot of things others offer, I've discovered to be less than ideal for myself, wanting to adopt more and more of the primary 1,3,5,7 forms of perception. the other forms are all really great and stuff, but from my perspective, only the 2nd is really anything that I find useful, but I'm starting to even warm up tto the idea that I don't even want 2nd ray perception, as I feel it could be emulated and accomplished using machines (that's off-topic though).
  - so, because we're so divided in our perception, my idea here was that we would take a spiral galaxy approach, where I represent one pole and they represent the other. I find their form of perception to not be bothersome at all, especially from a distance, and their getting in close to me makes their narrated reality stop working as intended.
  I'm going to keep going for what I want, and they're going to keep trying to gain as much separation from it as possible. right now, it seems that we share the same planet though, and I think that if they are able to take the 4 additional layers of perception on top, they could do whatever they wanted and be completely fine and without any risk of things going wrong -- and anyone wanting to join me, can -- and when they've figured out what they really want, they can create their own universe there and hold people whatever way they see fit.
  - I'm totally fine capitulating to their efforts to try and hold me down -- just I feel like their own growing dissatisfaction is eventually going to cause a separation from me -- which is fine by me. whatever they need to do to keep me whatever, they're doing, *not to me* but to *their perception of me*. they can't actually get me cause I'm going to arrive to where I'm going no matter what -- so what it all comes down to (from my perspective) is how enjoyable of a time do I want to have along the way. I keep delaying because I don't want the whole journey to be a fight. I'd rather to put in some time now and get on the airplane *together* in a non-fighting state, or to finally come to the conclusion that we are still divided in our perceptions, and that it's better to go different ways than to be constantly fighting (because conflict creates a lot of extra energy, which needs to find a place to manifest)
    inotherwords, we should decide between conflict *and* together manifestation, or divided manifestation and copperative.

there are a few things that I like about it though:

1. it gives everyone else (besides me and nosebook) a chance to find their own way, meaning that they can't just rely on me (like nosebook is wanting to do)
  - this really is the crux of the whole entry here, because what nosebook is essentially saying is, "we don't want others to be able to get an unfair advantage from your energy; therefore, we want to become the only ones that can take advantage of you"
  - does this sound familiar? it sounds like YHWH, which (IMO) is really old and outdated code.
    - on that subject, it occurred to me yesterday that the entity that I identified as "jesus" coming into my body when I was 16 was that little girl "anatau" which consequently, is also YHWH, however, in the event around vallecas and later on as well, they've been working to prevent my left-side from ever getting the ability to interface with the outside world, and have shut it down.
    - since it's been shut down to me, nosebook is using YHWH incarnate in me as the power source for their desire (cause most of them are 7th rays, it seems). however difficult she was to deal with, doesn't really matter to me because there were a lot of things about her perspective on desire that I really liked -- which I've taken for myself and rewritten and changed into what I've been calling YHVH, which is just my reinterpretation of that ancient code.
      - I have no idea where the code came from, but as best as I can figure out, it's essentially the centre perspective which is kinda like gold and silver together: mostly reflective, but also has a few well-defined parts of self; and so therefore YHWH would be a reflection of the hebrew peoples, which means that the hebrew peoples must havve had mostly 7th ray perspective (though I've noticed that most aryans see more from the 7th ray perspective; the atlanteans more from the 3rd)
      - however it works out, doesn't really matter to me, because it's a pretty pure reflection (meaning it was likely created by them as a machination of their mind) with a desire to never change (3rd ray perspective).
      - I've taken the reflective aspect and gone the complete opposite way with it: I embrace change, and find it to be the only thing "constant"; all change being a reflection of desire/attraction.
    - therefore, I find my version of this centre perspective as considerably improved upon that one. in addition to this YHWH has pretty much *only* the centre perspective, and so is pretty unrelatable to by many. *I* otoh, am also pretty competent with the actor (my default state), charactor (for the things I care about), and reflector (I'm nearly perfect), but most importantly (something that YHWH does not do), is I'm a great foil: meaning, I can reflect energy back to someone in a different way than I received it.
    - so while they've taken that entity on my left-side and hijacked it, I'm not too concerned because I've got my own system going that I thnik is better.
  - if there would be a way to get whatever it is that I have that they want, out of me, then they could have it for theirselves.
  - I imagine that this thing that I have, which they want (and never want me to have) is my left-side. they simply don't want that kind of desire to ever be able to begin creating, cause it would spell the "end" for them.
  - anyway, if it is my left-side, they can have it, as I obviously don't really use it. I've explained that I believe that this YHWH/anatau entity that they're so worried about my not having access to is actually a star in the centre of the planet: it's just a very high density, meaning very high frequency star -- and all I do is find ways to turn those high frequency concepts (cause they're physical enough by the time they reach me) into reality.
    - this kind of ties in to the keeping up with my expansion idea above -- because it's simple: desire must find a manifestation, otherwise it keeps accumulating into more and more incomprehensible chaos, that eventually forces a manifestation, if that continually expanding energy can't find a (7th ray) form/manifestation to get put into.
    - each time that a manifestation of desire is blocked, those opposed frequencies create more, which continues the accumulation, until something unexpected happens. in order to lower down the energy, small incremental manifestations are necessary to keep the energy from surpassing the limits of its present form.
    - this is essentially the same thing I was saying about vega: there's a lot of symbols there which are producing more and more chaos, and in order to lower down the energy of the star, one needs to find resonant forms for that energy to pass down into the conceptual and begin manifesting (first as a feeling, then image, then down to physical in some cases). it's not necessary to wait for the star to go past its limit and explode forcing the physical manifestation.
  - I'm pretty good at turning those high frequency concepts into reality, and if they can continue to turn those high frequency concepts into reality then that's great -- cause if they can't, then it's probably going to keep creating a vega-like situation where the energy is accumulating and has nowhere to go.
2. I don't have to deal with the (IMO) old form of attraction that is so popular amongst girls: which is that attraction is a *physical* thing: I need to be physically quite attractive (able to attract with physical sensation of desire), or show a power-display so that I can prove my power over physical (causing fear/awe/terror in others), etc.
  - I realise that girls don't tend to use the power-displays technique, but boys' feminine side does (expecially amongst the aryans) and I think that's a cennection to the old code coming from YHWH/anatau, where fear and terror was the strong motivating principle. (my left-side (lysander) has that perspective, which is why I know about it, but my right-side (demitrius) doesn't really have that perspective at all)
  - though girls don't use power-displays theirselves very much, it is still the case that they're attracted to it (which means they resonate with it), even if some part of their programming prevents them from engaging in power-displays to be attractive, some still are attracted to it in others.
3. there is something that seems just kind of funny to me about this idea of nosebook trying to keep me satiated with a bunch of girls, meanwhile I'm having a growing desire to create the things that I want to create.
  - however hilarious it'll be to watch all of the drama and conflict come out of them trying to keep me from creating anything or having any control, the reality is, I still don't fully know for myself how it is that I want to create the things that I want to create.
    - I'm not all that concerned about it, because I know that eventually my thoughts and emotions will start to manifest very rapidly -- almost as if 3d space and real physical objects will become my imagination -- meaning I'll dream and imagine things with physical objects that others can hold and stuff (no need for imagination, when I can put the concept directly into physical).
  - the real issue here is that I want to create the things that *I* want to create, and so on one side it's funny to try and watch nosebook control my creativity with a bunch of girls (cause it'll be impossible to stop that much creativity once they start the energy moving), my real problem is actually that I don't really want to create what the girls want -- because they're running a completely outdated form of perception/reflection/attraction from my point of view.
    - what I want to do, is not to creatte what the girls (or nosebook) wants, but to find a way to get them to reflect me and become centres theirselves. the easiest way to do that I think is to take on the "individual" perspective, and nosebook's fembots don't have an individual perspective at all. they're a reflection of nosebook, which is almost everything but the individual perspective: trust, security, ownership, superiority, etc. are not perspectives that an individual has (obviously, because it's all reflection).
    - therefore, it's likely that because of this I'll try and delay even more until they can figure out the reflective (centre and foil) perspectives.

in summary, I wouldn't consider this manifestation to be a thing that's actually happening just yet. I don't see it yet as reality, becaause I still think they're trying too hard to be the thing that I don't want to have (I say I don't like these aspects of girls' perception and nosebook says, OK, we'll make girls without that perception for you, and instead we (that control the girls) will have the perception instead). they moved the perception away from the girls as individuals, and put the perception on the organisation that controls the fembots. my difficulty is with the perception, not with any of the girls specifically.
the entire effort is to keep me as separated from others as possible; so that I never have a direct influence on anyone -- cause they want to be the middle-man (authority between the power source and the plebs).
just so you can see the big-picture here, I want to find others that have a centre perspective and they want to keep everyone else from ever getting the centre perspective by controlling all interactions with me.
their efforts to remain the middle-man are getting more and more stressed the longer I keep feeling-purposefully, not needing/wanting the manifestation (bceause I am the manifestation I'm looking for -- meaning this whole thing is about me finally figuring out what the centre perspective is for myself -- and has nothing to do with them). their efforts to force a manifestation are only because they want to be the middle-man and not the reflection of me.
  which means that I must, in some way want to be the middle-man for others in some way, myself. I suppose I like the idea that others can find their way *because of me* (that is middle-man-esque)... so in order to fully realise the centre-perspective, I have to completely give up on trying to be anything for anyone else and let them find it theirselves -- so I guess fembots it will end up becoming, unless others can find the centre-perspective too.
    as I move past the middle-man perspective, their entire operation will become outdated and a liability to itself, which will (like me) have to keep up with its own expansion, or face an explosion from an overflow of unmanifested energy.

#### 2023-05-11 13:30 - battle of the 1st rays

I noticed what's happening here and it seems to be a YHVH vs YHWH battle. nosebook has taken over my left-side which I believe can be seen as aproximately similar to YHWH (from my experience anyway). this is the same goddess as as sekmet and lilith, and when she doesn't get her way, she just keeps pushing until she gets it. I don't comport with that style of thinking and since I've had my left-side disabled, I've completely rewritten the code so that it's a significant improvment on the idea. it's all to do with feeling-purposefully, instead of throwing a fit when I don't get my way. that part exists (I believe) in my right-side.
tthat means there are two major problems looming on the horizon:

1. the battle inside of myself (cause some of the left-side's anatau still lingers)
  - implications for this are many, and neither of us want this to happen.
    - under significantly fast enough of energy (like if I watch stars or something; perhaps sex as well), my left-side will activate, and that's a huge problem for nosebook because it's the location of all of their secrets.
    - I also don't really want to be in battle with myself, but I suppose that it may very well happen at some point.
      - it's a really really strange feeling to be in battle with yourself -- and I don't know that anyone other than a brain injury person can really relate, because everyone else mostly has their passive side completely subdued by their dominant side, and so fights don't really often occur.
      - it's quite possible that the events playing out right now between nosebook and myself are the anatau vs cupid (or YHWH vs YHVH) battle, between the two hemispheres of my brain.
        - my version (YHVH) of desire comes from attraction and interacts with desire through the 5th ray aspect (concept and emotion)
        - their version (YHWH) of desire comes from a symbolically calculated desire (things like desire and fear, fight, flight, etc) and they are completely oblivious to the emotions, seeing that the calculated desire simply *must* happen (as if their survival depends on it). all things that work are seen as perfect, and things that don't work as the end of the world.
        - my version sees all interactions as relative to something else, and so all of the interactions I have are never a pure symbol but a spectrum of many symbols (this is our primary communication failure, because they need pure symbols: binaries, absolutes, truths, and certainties).
        - my version has nothing to do with action, and action is even perceived as undesirable, until it feels like it mixes with the rest of the things in a nice way. therefore, my version perceives more in the spectrum of want, meanwhile their perspective sees almost exclusively exactitudes: need.
      - I'm actually pretty convinced that I am "really only fighting myself" -- but because I don't have a pinecone, these battles aren't happening inside of my brain, but anatau has been externalised in the form of nosebook, and because she can no longer make my body do what it wants from inside of my brain (nosebook has all that shut down), so she's affecting the behaviour of nosebook to affect my behaviour to get what she wants -- and since they've got my left-side shut off, they are literally only fighting theirselves -- cause if they would activate my left-side, it would probably be more dominant than my right-side at the moment, and so therefore would take over -- and kenny's body would be doing the bidding of anatau/nosebook.
2. the battle between the planets.
  - I'm not 100% sure about this, so I'll just say what I know:
    - it looks to me like nosebook has been operating mostly out of vega, because it's where they're all in their astral bodies, and they're getting the rose-coloured reality as repainted through the narrative of venus.
    - it also looks like the location of anatau is on whatever earth I'm on (installed by hitler), and my implementation of it (cupid) is on the earth that I'm not on (so if I'm in vega, it's on earth). this setup is fine and even desirable I suppose (for me), because anatau is pumping out a whole lot of what nosebook consideres wanted (which I would consider unwanted because it's a narrative that I don't want to be a part of), so I turn their narrative desire into something that's attractive to me, and that gets output by cupid on the opposite side -- well, that causes (from my perspective) a lot of wanted to show up, but for them it's unwanted, because it doesn't conform to their forms (they're under the rule of thoth, meanwhile I'm under the rule of mars, so for me conflict is a good thing, and for them these are problem narratives not producing the symbols that they dsire)
  - it's quite possible that some of those ideas are backwards
  - I think of a possible solution though: imagine for a moment that I get put on the planet where cupid is, and the other astral me is placed on the opposite planet; then, we dismantle the great pyramid on one of the planets so that symbols only flow one way (nosebook toward me), and none of my symbols flow in their direction -- meaning that they don't have to battle any symbols I'm producing and aren't fitting into their narrative
  - I think that's the problem: my desire creates all sorts of symbols and realities for them that they don't really know how to deal with. they want a predictable system, and I want an attracted system.
  - they can turn on the left-side of the other kenny and because my symbols will no longer cause him to move around and stuff, they can fully activate him (the same as when I'm asleep) let him do all of the YHWH/anatau stuff that they want to. optionally though we'll receive the symbols here, and I'll feel compelleds to behave like anatau (for example the same thing that's happening when I write these), but those symbols are not a problem for us and we'll turn them into something wanted.
  - they'll use the left-side there leaving that right-side to be whatever. meanwhile, here, I'll use my right-side to be my desire source, leaving my left-side to be occupied with technology and stuff, allowing both of us to have what we want.
