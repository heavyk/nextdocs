# the manifestation

also known as "the apocalypse"

### 2022-09-15 21:33 - the problem with the manifestation

the major difficulty that I have with any manifestation with the girls is that it requires me to look at myself as "not good enough" -- as in, I couldn't do the manifestation (the apocalypse) all on my own.

to explain, notice that if I go with the girls, I already assume that I can't be stable by myself. that is probably true if I'm on drugs, but if I'm sober, I definitely can do the whole thing stable by myself.

you have to also look at the idea of the usefullness of such at thing. from the time I enter until the time I leave (never?), I'll be under their control, so if they would like to try out countless revisions on the timeline, they can. from their perspective, they can fix a whole bunch of things up just by taking control of my timeline.

---

in short, if I can find a way to join in a relationship with them at the same time as still feeling like I am good enough to do the manifestation by myself, then that would be better. you could see how that would be a problem though, to which means that I can't be a critic, because I'm totally rocking chair quarterbacking the thing saying, like "yep knew he shoulda ran right" -- as if I could do better.

from my perspective, I have no way to win. they liked me when I'm a critic of things, but if I get critical, then that gets punished because I'm back to saying, "I could totally do it without you" which is really troublesome for all types of relationships.

individuality is the number one difficulty thing to do when in a relationship. I'm going to be a total hypocrite telling them that individuality, when obviously I live in a group reality will be fairly apparent.

if I go for this, I don't really feel good about talking about individuality, unless I can demonstrate it. like, presently, I have very few people that determine my reality, so it's mostly me doing it. individuality is the ability to create one's own reality. when you get reality determined for you (as will be the case here soon), I'm not really creating my own reality with the same power I had before: the power of the individual.

the most difficult thing for me to wrap my head around on all of a manifestation with girls is this paradox of hypocracy.

### 2022-09-16 08:37 - not-good-enoughness

I woke up this morning thinking about how in the first entry there I put the problem with them seeing me as not good enough, but in reality, it doesn't really matter about that. because, worst case scenario, I resonate with their not-good-enoughness, and we figure out how to think more good-enough thoughts about ourselves and others.

which means that I won't feel like I can figure out the solutions to those ones without having girls around. which then means that nosebook will then have to keep me away from girls, because I figure out how to see things as good enough again.

I've figured out how to feel good enough about all sorts of stuff, so it's not like I'm bad at it (and statistically speaking, I'm prbably better than any of the rest at it rigtht now) so it's not like this is even a problem. I get to get better at figuring out good-enoughness perspectives, because they all probably have a lot of not-good-enoughness going on as it is, and it's all the same thing, so I can illustrate the same concept in many different scenarios and also improve my capacity to talk about things I know but don't practise as often.

... which then allows me to become the ultimate poser. and that's going to then get transferred into phase 2 of the apocalypse, which is when we become the dimension above that's sorta like dropping in new species and all sorts of other strange things into the 4d world.

with the other manifestation I'll transfer an entirely different energy into them. however, despite that, it still feels like I should just go the way of lovebites. when I add it all up, this is the worst manifestation possible (from most powerful people on this planet's perspective).

each of these different layers of fake reality that they put me in is yet another offset that I'll have to deal with whenever that false reality goes away. if they can get rid of that offset, it doesn't make much difference to me, and they're all making a ton of their own offsets to have to deal with later.

you know that most of the BS female concepts I had to redefine for myself is basically the way I got out. there is a lot of really (mostly self-) limiting beliefs in there, so if they wanted to clean a bunch of that up, they could. as is usual, it looks like that's still their bast way to make max contrast.

to explain this, imagine that you are a genetic algorithm and your fitness function is to generate contrast which is another opposite of novelty -- the other being habit -- you can see that contrast and habit are not the same thing. they're far from it. I suppose that more concepts can be added in to the negative side. like, what if we another one called probability, and so a new negative dimension is born: the opposite to novelyty is probability (and contrast, and habit).

ok, now because you're this sort of machine where your fitness function is to create maximum novelty by having a fitness function look at each thing from a novelty,contrast,habit,probability (NCHP) perspective and the one with the combined highest value is attained, it seeks more of those situations. you always want worse and worse NCHP ratings, so you optimise for those.

the trick is to find cleverer and cleverer ways to get out of a high novelty situation. when two situations compete, the compete for the best total value. since novelty, habit, and probability are the main contenders, and all in all the girls have you guys beat pretty well. know what I mean? I have to eventually go the highest total novelty. the lesser three contribute to novelty, but not directly. they're just things that determine the amplitude of the novelty when it's attracted.

you can also think of novelty as a major change in timeline. that novelty forever changed the trajectory throuh timeline, so more novelty means you're not really on the same timeline.

I've really been thinking about the conditional-time-straighteners and the "improve the past" slogans, and I'm convinced there's something to it. it's pretty likely there will be a battle you could imagine in the past, to try and fix the events how they were so that some of the "bad-guys" can slip through history undetected, so as to having made no discernable vibration, they'll enter the next dimension undetected, giving us free contrast. don't wanna go without that extra novelty, ya know. too abstract, I know.

in resume, I have to keep doing max contrast on my end until I don't have to anymore.

### 2022-09-16 10:29 - not-good-enoughness is like desire

when you consider that when you have sufficient not-good-enoughness, it produces good-enoughness.

to illustrate, I'm the king of not-good-enoughness. from their (the girls) perspective, nothing is ever good enough, but from my perspective, I just want to find my connection.

it's only when I've found enough connection that I feel good-enoughness, and then that is when I'm ready. I can see how from their perspective it looks like I never think it's good enough. it's always good-enough from a high enough perspective.

there's something more to be said about this, but it has escaped me.

### 2022-09-16 10:39 - I think I've pretty much set my goal

so I was thinking about it a bit outside, and there are other options for starting out, but I do believe that I do want to end up in this sort of reality matrix. I think it is the worst possible manifestation for the "popular" vote.

along the way to get there, it'd be really fun to make it even worse. I don't have to do anything. they already have to try and prevent it, so they have to come up with something that will (apparently) try and prevent this WPM, but it's always the case that when making action against sometihng you make the concept that created that thing stronger, so even their best efforts will produce even more WPM.

I figure that after some time they'll really be in a huge pickle, which is good because they don't need to actually do anything for survival because they can't get it wrong. they'll be inextricably linked to our dimension above, so no matter how hard they try to mess it up, they can't.

if they want to get out of the power structure, they won't be able to, so they'll have to figure out how to make their own dimension. a demiurge of maximum capacity.

that way they'll have their own private dimension and also the girls will have their own dimension. when the population becomes a global population, competition will arise in seeming physical dissimilarity (race, colour, gender, etc.), and so this provides for a perfect factioning to begin besides just the binary opposites (my <|not >same or preferred race/colour/gender). they're actually kind of the same dimension, but two different perspectives into it. nosebook from a masculine perspective and nosebook from a feminine perspective (and both of their subsequent perspectives/definitions of all demographics through statistics). in reality neither is even close to reality, but it will shape our reality to their expectations.

### 2022-09-16 10:57 - I wonder the validity of this

I'm listening to a korolova mix and one guy commented that the two things were not well mixed because somehow the slider got left in the middle or something. the guy commented "amateure hour" and so as I was feeling out the thought, I was reminded of st-michaels-work, where his whole job is to keep us all focused on the hymnal.

the picture I had is that these different performers are out there doing things, but their vision has gotten so detailed, that reality is starting to kinda like melt out and it's so hard to stay focused on reality because the only thing they can see is theirself (this is kinda what the start of 5d is sorta like).

so they're having all these problems trying to keep it together, and the ones that know how to not look at theirself too seriously are the ones that are doing well.

it has to do with the way that we care about what others think, but if you think about it, it also manifests as not-good-enoughness. I can look out and see other people doing amazing things, but I can't myself, so I'm probably not good enough to do it.

that's kind of a weird one that disguises itself as not-good-enoughness, but really it's caring too much what others think.

### 2022-09-16 12:53 - a valid concern on narration

this idea goes something like this: right now I'm sorta the narrator of what's happening in the world. if I come out into public, that changes.

same with if I go with the girls. they'll take over a lot of my narration for me (I would hope, anyway).

something to keep in mind. the idea that just came to me is that if we invented a new way to narrate, and by doing that, we're completely leaving the narration to the other narrators.

this will largely set the dividing line between dimensions, and the deciding factor is what narrative they're listening to. imagine the offset on that one: imagine a person that has a very open mind but they're listening to a closed-mind narrator. they get to the side they're going and realise it was all a sham. I think that means I'm going that I'm going to the opposite of that, so I'm going to be the most open minded individual, but in a world built by the narrators. which are my narrators?

some individuals want to be my narrators. I don't see anything wrong with that. it's just more contrast for me. each of these narrated worlds I don't really see, so they have to find ways of integrating me into those other narratives.

so if I go with the girls, they lose connection to my narrative. that's their main concern.

I say let them have some control over my narrative because narrative is really quite funny when the narrators don't have a clue what's actually happening. it's probably pretty comedic, honestly.

---

I'm still trying to figure out how to integrate my future in. I was thinking about how I was going to define it for people and I was thinking about really maybe doing some statistical analysis on it, maybe some risk assessment, and projections. that'd be really awesome.

once we've figured it out statistically, we can just use that as a sorta joke later, kinda like how they were actually our minimum expectations. for me though it's going to be pretty fun because I think probabilities don't really exist (as weird as that sounds).

to explain how I don't think that probabilities don't exist I have to demonstrate by example: we need to build up imaginary scenarios (a set of expectations) and then figure out the statistical probability of meeting another set of expectations in X amount of time. most of the time it'll fail (or, at least I would hope so).

---

my reality was constructed out of symbols and I'll have to pay for that offset later on, but your reality is constructed out of possibilities, and so, you'll probably have to pay for that later on, as well.

these sorts of offsets stack up extra of this opposite to novelty stuff (habit, contrast, probabilities, but there was a fourth one I can't remember now). those things produce instability in the next form of perception and so that becomes the "seed contrast" for the next dimension. so it's probably planned/inteded.

---

I explained the fourth opposite to novelty yesterday, but it got erased I believe (or perhaps other timeline), but the fact remains that I'm still unable to locate it, so it's time to update the concept. whenever a concept goes away from my mind, I have to find a new way to get to the same concept again (so I can explain it), so that means that I get better at getting to a concept. I'll think of it again soon enough, and probably better the next time too. as such, I don't mind having to get to a concept again from more and more unique ways. I'm good at getting around stuff (like physical laws, of science).

it's probably one of the aspects with an extra dimension (resistance -> programmable resistance)

### 2022-09-16 17:27 - different domains of reality

one of the things I could see is that we're going to need narrators to keep up the contrast. then, I could see that we all would supply sort of "reality domains" and these would be run various reality marketing companies.

I don't remember the rest.

### 2022-09-18 03:30 - the trance or drug state

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/tRvko3rCCAU)

these states are one way to achieve an altered state of consciousness, but I know for certain that I do not want to make any manifestation when I'm stoned or under the influence of anything, so if you want me making conscious and clear decisions, I want to go sober. then the idea was that nosebook does *not* want me making conscious decisions, so they do actually want me stoned. I don't want to be stoned because that totally sucks. also, if stoned it's definitely something we'll pay for later, of course.

### 2022-09-18 03:47 - desire is produced from unwanted

the ability to perceive unwanted isn't learned for a bit. you can produce symbolic states for wanted and symbolic states for unwanted as well, and this is basically the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (both in present and future projections).

so I really only refine my ability to perceive unwanted over time. unwanted is a symbolic construct just like wanted so you can see that if you can now see that there is no good or bad anymore, so you just see it for what it is. in 4d, everything still has a singular angle to it, but in 5d, you see it for what it is, rathar than what it appears to be in any point in time or space (the illusion). this is pure desire.
