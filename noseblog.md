### 2021-06-18 13:45 - starting over

I decided to completely reset and start over. I shaved my head and am starting a new keyboard layout as well. it is going slow, hehe.

so many things are different and this layout isn't final at all. I'm just trying it out to see how to improve on it before using his code to make my own. I noticed that I have different finger costs than he does. I also really like the 's' on the left side, but I do like the 3 finger space in the middle. the location of the 'v' and the 'p' are super annoying though. oh yeah I hate the 'k' loc as well.

other than the kbd, I have noticed a lot of changes in how much I feel now too. earlier I had a conversation with mom about hair and it wasn't until later on that I noticed the reactions to it. I still get the reactions but they are so faint now that I'm kinda like your average dude now that it largely unaware of the reactions. it's nice be masculine again. I can just fumble around while everyone else cringes. I intend to do just that. I was thinking that there is desire for a new trump -- the ex-president.

imagine that we're all cruising along and you guys all have your manifestations (the automatons) and I remain largely how I am. you guys have the data and I continue on with my theories and ideas, of some of them are still wrong. I do like I do now where I keep updating my ideas with the feedback I get from my sixth-sense.

that means you guys get to hold the high ground with all your data and stuff and I get to be repeatedly wrong as I pontificate my way toward the better and better way of perceiving it. I don't mind being repeatedly wrong, way off-base and cringe.


### 2021-06-18 17:19 - the way I see it happening

when I think of how something divides or reproduces, there seems to have a moment when the environment is no longer suitable for the emerging entity -- like a birth or a cell division.

next, I have noticed how influential mr. motor's attraction on my situation is -- like, I think he was giving his attention to how annoying it is to babysit me, and then now without a computer to occupy me, he has a whole lot more babysitting to do. or my hair -- I remember him trying to get me to cut it numerous times in dreams -- or back when he believed that force-ejaculating me was reducing energy until I started to get vision upgrades from it.

I don't imagine that nosebook can allow me to gain temporal awareness because they have stuff to hide, however like I said, it's not all that bad: I won't have any sex but I will be able to fly around and create objects with my mind -- including human bodies science would probably consider dead. they will become animated though -- and they will (like a child) become a reflection of the person they are interacting with. I can imagine all sorts of uses for these guys and girls. however, I won't have control or even much influence over them -- you'll get what you attract from them.

the creation process for these guys can be automated, but at the beginning I will simply feel the person and then turn that feeling into one of desire until it becomes reality. neither of us will know what will show up; I can only feel it coming. after they see it, they will react and I can again turn the feeling into desire and repeat. for most people, this will be purely visual, so I am sure some effort will be made to perform this process in the privacy of one's own imagination.

so while all of this is happening, you can imagine how much anticipation I have to create technology to words and ideas into a computer faster and easier. sure, I won't have access to my imagination or properly see through my own eyes but I can create technology to greatly enhance my experience.

I may be wrong a lot in the beginning, but as fast as I can think up experiments and run them, I will catch up rapidly. because all of my "imagination" will happen is 3d space, everything will be visible and seen in low quality 3d. I have lots of ideas on how to improve our relation with machines without any utilisation of the imagination.

I even think it's possible to redesign humans too, as I really want explore a lot of ideas I have at running hominid species at microprocessor speeds -- amongst further explorations into more hairless models and other improvements people come up with their fancies.

while all of this is happening I believe the planet will rotate faster and have a stronger magnetic field. mr. motor will continue to fight me gaining temporal perception, but ultimately he'll attract the very thing he's fighting against and something will happen where I/we go our separate ways -- or, be born into a new reality. the baby cannot go back into the mother's womb. after the water breaks, it is an incompatible environment for the baby.

the magnetic field strength and reversals is very likely related to rotation speed and just before the separation is a peak like [this](https://www.planetanalog.com/wp-content/uploads/content-images-planetanalog-Image-7-1503855184.png).

I wonder if harmonics to make that square wave must be other stars' orbital resonances in the local cluster and if this is the same mechanism causing cells to divide. I suspect it is.

### 2021-06-22 11:50 - learning the atreus

the white layout really opened my mind with having more keys to press so the atreus is a little bit different in that it has less keys and forces me to type more properly with both hands on the keyboard. I feel like it is a step in the right direction though. I really mostly just need practise.

the wierdest thing about the atreus is that there isn't any buttons next to my pinky fingers. I also keep noticing that I want to press the corresponding key with my opposite hand as if my muscle memory wore mirrored or something. very strange.

### 2021-06-24 02 02:49 - some thinking on resistance

I was having a monologue on how time worked again and I thought to type it instead because I want the practise. I got to the part where I talked about where reality reflects what we feel and believe and that dreams are the best example of this.

in a dream, if I try to resist the reality, then it gets worse. however, if I just allow what I want to experience, then it just shows up. it doesn't matter how much resistance there is to that all around, it will still appear. it would be like the plastic insulator trying to block the current in the copper -- what I mean is this: if this reality is nothing more than an elaborate dream that we all believe/feel is/as real -- so like atoms are manifesting and stuff... then the one with the least resistance is always more effective at manifesting reality than everyone else is.

the other day I was talking with mom about lowering resistance is short of like lowering one's sail. I like the analogy still quite a lot if one perceives the wind as other people's beliefs -- they're not influencing me very much anymore. that doesn't mean I can do anything I want to just yet either -- I still need to have my own resistance/beliefs to propel me forward though.

more soon...

### 2021-06-24 14:02 - mastering space and time

I figure that there are two major categories in which almost all emotional discomfort falls into:

1. things or people (conditions) which I need to be different so that I can feel the way I want to (temporal discomfort)
2. caring too much about what others think about me or the manifestation (spatial discomfort)

these can be overcome quite easily with practise, and real
