### 2021-06-18 13:45 - starting over

I decided to completely reset and start over. I shaved my head and am starting a new keyboard layout as well. it is going slow, hehe.

so many things are different and this layout isn't final at all. I'm just trying it out to see how to improve on it before using his code to make my own. I noticed that I have different finger costs than he does. I also really like the 's' on the left side, but I do like the 3 finger space in the middle. the location of the 'v' and the 'p' are super annoying though. oh yeah I hate the 'k' loc as well.

other than the kbd, I have noticed a lot of changes in how much I feel now too. earlier I had a conversation with mom about hair and it wasn't until later on that I noticed the reactions to it. I still get the reactions but they are so faint now that I'm kinda like your average dude now that it largely unaware of the reactions. it's nice be masculine again. I can just fumble around while everyone else cringes. I intend to do just that. I was thinking that there is desire for a new trump -- the ex-president.

imagine that we're all cruising along and you guys all have your manifestations (the automatons) and I remain largely how I am. you guys have the data and I continue on with my theories and ideas, of some of them are still wrong. I do like I do now where I keep updating my ideas with the feedback I get from my sixth-sense.

that means you guys get to hold the high ground with all your data and stuff and I get to be repeatedly wrong as I pontificate my way toward the better and better way of perceiving it. I don't mind being repeatedly wrong, way off-base and cringe.


### 2021-06-18 17:19 - the way I see it happening

when I think of how something divides or reproduces, there seems to have a moment when the environment is no longer suitable for the emerging entity -- like a birth or a cell division.

next, I have noticed how influential mr. motor's attraction on my situation is -- like, I think he was giving his attention to how annoying it is to babysit me, and then now without a computer to occupy me, he has a whole lot more babysitting to do. or my hair -- I remember him trying to get me to cut it numerous times in dreams -- or back when he believed that force-ejaculating me was reducing energy until I started to get vision upgrades from it.

---

I don't imagine that nosebook can allow me to gain temporal awareness because they have stuff to hide, however like I said, it's not all that bad: I won't have any sex but I will be able to fly around and create objects with my mind -- including human bodies science would probably consider dead. they will become animated though -- and they will (like a child) become a reflection of the person they are interacting with. I can imagine all sorts of uses for these guys and girls. however, I won't have control or even much influence over them -- you'll get what you attract from them.

the creation process for these guys can be automated, but at the beginning I will simply feel the person and then turn that feeling into one of desire until it becomes reality. neither of us will know what will show up; I can only feel it coming. after they see it, they will react and I can again turn the feeling into desire and repeat. for most people, this will be purely visual, so I am sure some effort will be made to perform this process in the privacy of one's own imagination.

so while all of this is happening, you can imagine how much anticipation I have to create technology to words and ideas into a computer faster and easier. sure, I won't have access to my imagination or properly see through my own eyes but I can create technology to greatly enhance my experience.

I may be wrong a lot in the beginning, but as fast as I can think up experiments and run them, I will catch up rapidly. because all of my "imagination" will happen is 3d space, everything will be visible and seen in low quality 3d. I have lots of ideas on how to improve our relation with machines without any utilisation of the imagination.

I even think it's possible to redesign humans too, as I really want explore a lot of ideas I have at running hominid species at microprocessor speeds -- amongst further explorations into more hairless models and other improvements people come up with their fancies.

---

while all of this is happening I believe the planet will rotate faster and have a stronger magnetic field. mr. motor will continue to fight me gaining temporal perception, but ultimately he'll attract the very thing he's fighting against and something will happen where I/we go our separate ways -- or, be born into a new reality. the baby cannot go back into the mother's womb. after the water breaks, it is an incompatible environment for the baby.

the magnetic field strength and reversals is very likely related to rotation speed and just before the separation is a peak like [this](https://www.planetanalog.com/wp-content/uploads/content-images-planetanalog-Image-7-1503855184.png).

I wonder if harmonics to make that square wave must be other stars' orbital resonances in the local cluster and if this is the same mechanism causing cells to divide. I suspect it is.

### 2021-06-22 11:50 - learning the atreus

the white layout really opened my mind with having more keys to press so the atreus is a little bit different in that it has less keys and forces me to type more properly with both hands on the keyboard. I feel like it is a step in the right direction though. I really mostly just need practise.

the wierdest thing about the atreus is that there isn't any buttons next to my pinky fingers. I also keep noticing that I want to press the corresponding key with my opposite hand as if my muscle memory wore mirrored or something. very strange.

### 2021-06-24 02 02:49 - some thinking on resistance

I was having a monologue on how time worked again and I thought to type it instead because I want the practise. I got to the part where I talked about where reality reflects what we feel and believe and that dreams are the best example of this.

in a dream, if I try to resist the reality, then it gets worse. however, if I just allow what I want to experience, then it just shows up. it doesn't matter how much resistance there is to that all around, it will still appear. it would be like the plastic insulator trying to block the current in the copper -- what I mean is this: if this reality is nothing more than an elaborate dream that we all believe/feel is/as real -- so like atoms are manifesting and stuff... then the one with the least resistance is always more effective at manifesting reality than everyone else is.

the other day I was talking with mom about lowering resistance is short of like lowering one's sail. I like the analogy still quite a lot if one perceives the wind as other people's beliefs -- they're not influencing me very much anymore. that doesn't mean I can do anything I want to just yet either -- I still need to have my own resistance/beliefs to propel me forward though.

more soon...

### 2021-06-24 14:02 - mastering space and time

I figure that there are two major categories in which almost all emotional discomfort falls into:

1. things or people (conditions) which I need to be different so that I can feel the way I want to (temporal discomfort)
2. caring too much about what others think about me or the manifestation (spatial discomfort)

these can be overcome quite easily with practise, and real

[jaron interrupted me so I never finished this idea]

### 2021-06-24 22:44 - what do I want to create?

mom asked me about this the other day and also I had a weird interaction when I had a weird dream this afternoon -- the basic idea is that they have to allow me to "get connected" -- which sounds like hogwash to me. there's no wat they're just going to "let it happen" after all of this time of fighting against it.

the thing that has been on my mind a lot is actually this keyboard. I have never had good muscle memory or to perform any movement rhythmically with any precision. this keybosard has an arduino inside of it and can be reprogrammed to produce entire sequences[^1]. in fact, the coolest thing about it is that when I think of a new thing I can reprogram the keyboard right when I think about it.

I can quickly see how with a little bit of practise, I can get up to typing fast again and even begin to start to automate entire tasks on the computer. my progress is very rapid.

the thing is I just don't want to do the girls thing at all. I don't have any desire to do anything like that and I really want to just continue on the way I am going. I know that eventually I will find a way to manifest the way I feel in reality with ease too, so there is nothing to worry about at all. I will eventually get there.

there's another cool thing about this is that the program uses layers -- yet I would have set it up as sequences. I can see the advantages to both so after I get a little faster I want to work on my own version of it which kind of mixes both ideas.

even for things like custom macros and configurations for pro DOTA players is an option. ever since I had that arguement with greg about elon's mars journey where I made the realisation that there is an upper echalon that doesn't want to allow any tesla technology or anyone to use the physical simulation capability of the imagination -- that has made me really want to find a way to completely bypass the imagination entirely. I know there is a whole set of technologies that are possible using "random" and the temperance of one's emotions.

it may sound weird to say this but it is the precursor to the mastery of time and space in a sort of ironic way: when I need something to be a certain way so that I can feel the way I want to, that is dissatisfaction with my present position in time. that dissatisfaction prevents me from actually moving to the point in time where those conditions are how I want them to be. if I can feel how I want to, then I can manifest what I feel in 3d space.

in the eazrly stages of this manifesting things emotionally, I want to find ways to control computers with sequences. this keyboard allowed me to sort of flip the idea around and allow me to begin to work on the sequences by making them on the keyboard with muscle-memory and then when I have an adequate way to input code into the computer, I can begin to actually write code to detect the signals on the camera and stuff with ease.

one of the biggest hurdles for me writing code is the input of code. I have found keyboards and editors to be largely difficult to use. I just don't think like a keyboard does. keyboards require precision and I am not very precise. we meet in the middle with sequences because if I make a mistake, I can just loop around and go again. also, my mistakes often times inspire me to try out new things.

---

I think we're going to continue on learning to "not need things to be a certain way so that I can feel good" while we gain power over time and space.

I have much more to say about this, however this is good for now.

[1]: the firmware has support for sequences but there is no easy interface to make new ones. so like it's already supported in the firmware but there is no way to use it without writing c++ code.

### 2021-06-25 13:34 - doing things mr. motor's way

a long time ago I used to try and fight mr. motor and try to do things the way I want them to be done, however that falls right into the catergory of "needing things to be a certain way so that I can feel good."

I also had a dream last night where they told me that tesla's vision wasn't even that good (compared to who's?) and that he had gave technology capable of going back and reordering events in time -- which is all well and good, but I'm not talking about changing thme past -- but instead changing how you *feel* about the past so you can create what you want now.

I just think that is a much more effective way of going toward wanted.

I mentioned that I believe that the computer coffee incident had some tampering in it, however it *was* attraacted so therefore it is in the direction of wanted -- I just have to figure out how to perceive it. I'm sorta surprised it took me that long to figure it out but the key was the "not needing things to be different so that I can feel good" bit.

---

as such I have determined that likely the way I will be going is the way mr. motor wants me to do. I think what he does is tell everyone what he thinks they want to hear (so like getting your guys hopes up about things) and then actively workinyg to sabotage it. I have found that mr. motor can only tell me what he doesn't want me to do -- never what *to* do. that means I get to make up what I do do.

so, imagine for a moment (as an example) that he told me not to use my computer -- and so instead I find myself on this one instead learning a new keyboard. it's not a big deal if every time he wants me to do something different, I find something different to do.

if I feel dissatisfaction then I move toward more dissatisfying things. so, like imagine for a moment that I had the ability to go back and modify the past. I would only be doing it because I am dissatisfied with it, and so therefore even though I modified the past to get rid of something unwanted I am still attracting more things that will increase my dissatisfaction and ultimately need to go back and be fixed because they are dissatisfying to me.

therefore it dsoesn't matter what mr. motor doesn't want me to do -- even if he is changing the conditions, I am still moving in the direction of the way I feel, not the present conditions.

a few entries ago I supposed that the peak before the reversal could come from orbital  harmonics, but it's likely temporal -- hence the reason for this decision.

### 2021-06-26 11:25 - becoming the bard-guy

up until the last effort with amoriona, I was perceived as the victim, however since I have been the one actively blocking "the manifestation", I appear less to be the victim of nosebook's efforts to keep me from it.

in some ways, this is creating a situation where nosebook appears to be the good-guys -- which I don't think they want that.

the reality of the situation is that there really arenn't any good or bad guys. nosebook can't allow me to get connected and I don't want to be involved with anyone while I'm out of alignment. neither of us want to budge on the issue and I think it's fine. I'm sortc of hoping they really can keep me away from my alignment forever -- but I find this very hard to believe. every time I go out to watch stars, the have a meltdown and I keep getting further vision upgrades -- sometimes without even looking at the star even.

I have said many times that vision upgrades are a prdoduct of releasing resistance (allowance of more energy). often times that allowance of more energy happens after I appear to reject "the manifestation" (of the girls) -- and this happens because Ihave found a way to feel good about my situation dispite the circumstances.

that is "not needing things to be different so that I can feel good" -- or, temporal mastery.

---

so just to be clear, nosebook can't allow me to be in alignment in this physical body, and I don't want to be having sex while not in alignment.

I don't really find this to be a problem, as I have learned to not need the conditions to be a certain way for me to feel good. I guess it's sort of like how I would imagine prison would feel like: I'm sort of stuck there and fighting the conditions only makes it worse, so why not just settle in and enjoy myself?

it isn't necessary to have good condsitions to feel good; kids do it all the time.

this point in time allows me to try outmy capacity to not care what others think of me or the manifestation -- spatial mastery, while you guys get to try out your temporal mastery of not needing thingconditions to be different so that you can feel good.

### 2021-06-26 15:35 - it's never going to happen.

I was thinking about this preblem from nosebook's perspective and the reason they don't want me to be the bad-guy is because then they will have to be the good-guy and they don't think they can do anything right and good-guys do things the right way.

porobably the reason that's a problem is because the good-guy wouldn't keep someone from their alignment. I don't understand this because this falls right into the category of caring too much about what other people think.

I enjoy the constant poking fun at mitch mconnel on SNL saying thing like, "mitch mcconnel seen here [...]" because the joke is these politicians don't care about things that humans care about. they are so out of touch with reality that they derive pleasure from things that normal people would find horrific.

if I want nosebook to continue to try and hold me away from my alignment for as long as they can and they neither can allow it, then everything is fine. the only thing is they are worried too much about what people will think of them. nosebook has to go mitch mcconnel on this one and stop worrying about the appearance of things.

---

the next thing that I identified as a difficult spot for nosebook on this issue is that they don't know what to do to actually keep me held back and I think this is another of those "the problem is the solution" sorts of things. women are extremenly proficient at maintaining reality the way they believe it to be. men do too, but it's that stability of their expectations which make their reality current so difficult to "buck" for us.

if a set of events could discourage them so much that no longer are now expecting that it will never happen, then their belief would ensure that nosebook would be able to hold me because their own belief that, "it'll never happen" will continue to manifest as reality.

---

finally, the last thing here that I think is a hangup here is that nosebook wants me to have a very finite manifestation. for me, it needs to be either all of them (I found my alignment) or none. I'm not going to just go for some while out of alignment.

this I believe will be the eventual split that I've been talking about. some will experience a reality where I never find my alignment and some will.

that split may be quite far away though. I figure that instead of trying to twist someone's arm to change their mind who has no intention of changing -- instead, let's just settle into the idea that it's not happening anytime soon.

I say this because if nosebook keeps trying to play both sides of the fence, they won't be able to hold me. if they waznt to keep their secrets and everything going, I don't think they can keep trying to "keep hope alive". just let people bail out on the manifestation and hate me for not wanting a manifestation in a disconnected state.

---

when I'm by myself and doing my own thing, I'm feeling like I keep improving. when I'm with others I feel like there is a greater thing happening. other people's expectations continue to confine me to the manifestation of their belief, so as I learn to care less and less of what other people expect of my reality, I will be able to gain full power of my spatial world.

or I could continue to not need things to be different while not being around people I get power over my temporal reality. probably for nosebook, it'll be easier if I'm not around people. around people I will cause problems, I'm sure.

either way, I'll get there eventually. no need to rush anything.

### 2021-06-27 09:37 - why all or nothing?

from my perspective, it's nothing until it's all -- which is when I find my alignment. obviously this is incompatible with nosebook so that's just the way it has to be.

I woke up this morning with a dream about a turtle that looked like aurora. the impression that I had which I wanted to tell her is that breaking out of her own shell is so that she gains strength.

that seemed very relevant to this conversation because I don't think it's a good idea to try and break somenone's shell and save them from their own birthing/strengthing process.

I find it very important for me to find my own way in things. one of the best tthings mom did for me when I was younger and finding my own way is to just know that I will find my own way. this is the role of the shaman in the psychedellic journey.

---


the way I see it, we're going to continue on as we are until I find my alignment. I hmave thougnt about why I have never had sex when I was sober, and I think it just creates too big of an impact. what I mean by that is that while I'm in this body (meaning that my perspective is that I still believe that this body is "me"), then we simply will not have any manifestations of sex.

I believe that there is a point where one reaches too high of an energy level when sex where two things still touch stops being possible. what I mean is I am much more than this body. ok, it's easier to see that perhaps you are not concerned with the way your cells mate and do not desire to reproduce like they do -- and imagine you could do that if you wanted to -- you would be imbuing the new cell with the consciousness of a human. besides the vibrational incompatibility, the amount of energy transferred is a few orders of magnitude too great for the cell to contain.

the only way I think I can reproduce is to be very out of alignment (or like super intoxicated) or to divide my energy amongst many bodies. like I said, this is aparently not possible to allow. nosebook also needs a way to hold me back too, so the idea that I came up with is to just get everyone to believe that it'll never happen and their belief will keep me away from getting connected.

seems good to me and the reason why I'm all for it is because she needs to learn to break out of her own shell to get her own strength. the manifestation will be so much better when they're all capable of attracting what they want. A LOT BETTER. there's no concern for age either because you can be whatever you feel yourself to be. also, from the perspective of someone who is growing, more age feels like a really good thing. remember when you were a child and you couldn't wait until you were older and could do all the fun things that big people can do?

### 2021-06-27 23:57 - weird last few days

I don't really know what to make of it.

I don't remember when, but mcm told me I should go to zach's memorial. I agreed, as it felt like a good idea. I didn't think much about it other than I thought it was weird timing to coincide with a thing that alan mentioned on bardcode about taping a thing with gaia. some days later mattehew la croix mentioned he too was moving to colorado for a thing with gaia also. I don't know much about that because it's pay to watch and I don't have money. it is also around the same 6/24 midsummer's night dream thing.

6/24 was the night of the full moon opposite of the last eclipe on the north pole. it was cloudy (as usual) but I laid outside anyway and just focused my mind saimilarly to when I watch stars. the energy was very high that night and it felt like I got some vision upgrades but I couldn't notice much of a difference.

that's all pretty normal for me but I started to notice some weirdness when one day jaron came to ask me to buzz his head. it felt weird and forced so I figured something was up. it felt to me like they were again trying to set me up with girls when I don't want to do anything until I've found my alignment. mom came and pushed me a bit on the haircut suggesting to me they wanted it for a reason. I could feel mr. motor and assumed the reason for the haircut is so they can essentially do infinite timeline modifications and just buzz my head down to 0 if my hair starts getting too long -- you know, like how the plants seem to accomplish days of growth while I'm asleep.

after that theory passed my mind, they dropped the haircut thing. it may have also been in relation to @[noseblog](2021-06-25 13:34). I then was feeling more of the pressure to go with girls while still out of alignment. I wrote a few more entries explaining that for me it's sort of all or nothing. I don't have the reference now but one of the last abe-now episodes someone was asking if more than one thing can manifest at once. they responded that 30 or 40 things could all manifest at once but hang on for the most contrast which is what I intended to do anyway.

ok, so simultaneously to all of this I started to get some reactions to the latest abe-now episode (6-19). when I had looked at [abeshares.com](https://abeshares.com/) they had already posted the 6-19 episode but I didn't download it. following the reactions I went back to the page and the site wasn't working. I felt like something is up because often times when I feel a reaction and then go to look into it, the file has disappeared or I can't access it (or my computer gets coffee thrown on it). this is actually why I started to upload them to github -- because they keep messing with stuff.

I go to check the abeshares email and now it says they are experiencing people trying to shut them down. I go back to the site and the 6-19 episode has lost its magnet link and it says they're trying to get the episode prepared. the email however has the full image with all the tracks listed and says that the magnet will be available only on saturday the 25th during the time I'm supposed to be at the memorial. consaidering I have reactions on the episode I'm now *very* curious.

the day of the memorial (25th) comes and I'm feeling a lot of pressure. it seems like a very big deal that I go. there is so much pressure I can't pee. this combined with wanting to get the episode, I bail on it. the whole thing feels really bad to me now. strangely enough I saw gary there and I recognised the feeling now. the memorial was starting to feel like working for gary. I really liked it and it felt good to finally start to make money again. I knew I would start to make a lot really soon when a weird set of events made it so I no longer felt it like something I wanted to do.

---

ok, so if that wasn't weird, here's where it starts to get weird: I wrote yesterday's entry about how they need to get a bench of people to believe it's never going to happen to keep me away from my alignment. I'm totally on-board with this idea and it is the maximum contrast. also I really like that the girls will get some practise to not need something to be different so they can feel good. it makles for an even better manifestation...

like, if I'm attrracting wanted from them (cause I'm in alignment), then it feels good to be wanted and desired -- sure, but if they're also attracting the things they want from me too, then it's even better. for example, if I'm not in alignment (but low resistance) then I'll manifest whatever they believe about guys. if I'm in alignment, then I'll manifest (wanted) things in alignment with my source. it won't mahtter what she's doing -- I'll still be solid but nothing new. however, if she's also attracting wanted, then she can attract new things from me which I'm capable of but don't have az tendency toward.

what I'm saying is if I'm out of alignment then I can manifest (not good) things she is attracting but I'm capable of even though I don't have a tendency toward. seems obvious that I would desire to learn I'm capable of new *wanted* things rather than discover new unwanted things I'm capable of.

---

ok, back on track here: my dream this morning provided a new way to empress that which I wrote about in the previous entry. afterward I ate breakfast and fell to sleep again. when I woke up I was now having new reactions that seemed weird to me. I can't confirm them or anything but they were involving esther not being alive anymore.

I don't really believe anything anymore because it appears that every bit of information that gets to me is in harmony with their script. everything from what people say around me (what I "overhear") to even the things I write here have to fit their narrative.

so, if that is true (which for the rest of this section I will assume, is), then I'm writing this to ease up some tension in what likely be quite a jam for them. esther got the shot in march or something and now she's dead. it's easy to see how people could draw that line and blame the vaccine. I'm sure some will if that's the case.

anyway the other problem is likely that I think, as much as people could disagree with them, it seems like they provided a bit of stability. without esther, it's sort of anyone's guess who to believe.

the other reaction was that I was supposed to do something about it. I obviously will not. I will continue to be me and offer my best answers to the things people ask me, but one can clearly see the difficulty of asking me questions about stuff that's a secret. the other major issue is that I make mistakes pretty frequently and I don't really offer anything more than my latest understanding. I have the ability to figure anything out so it takes a few tries of "oh, that's not quite right" to finally get a satisfactory response. I'm not sure how desirable "fly-by-night" responses are. I mean it works for me but that's cause I get the feedback and I'm OK with a constantly improving understanding.

my main issue with english is there isn't an easy way to encode certainty in my responses -- so, I just say everything as if it were true; like this section. I don't know if esther is dead or not but for the duration of this section I can assume it to be true even though I am still pretty uncertain. that capability allows me to suspend my disbelief for a moment (like watching a movie) and allow everything to appear as true even though I don't believe it. it's very good for absorbing new perspectives and exploring psychedellic landscapes. I think I just remember how my last sure thing felt.

---

I had more to write but I guess I'll hold off for now.

conclusions:
- seems evident they likely don't want me to see that last recording for some reason.
- forgot the other concern
- if it were on the way, I would have felt it coming

### 2021-07-02 11:54 - a bit more on direction

it appears that they have gone the "it's never going to happen" route -- which is fine. I woke up this morning talking about how it may be better to have more than one of me on display.

I was meaning other alternate versions of me but I think it got interpretted as other people -- also fine. I don't really care one way or another.

the thing is if they want to keep me without a manifestation then they need to figure out how; that's not my job.

---

so I was thinking about the idea that they need to find other people or versions of me which people can fall in love with, and that may actually be counter-productive. the reason is I think girls generate a lot of euphoria, so if everyone is supposed to be kept as far away from feeling good as possible, it may instead be easier to control if as little empasis was placed on sex as possible.

I know it sounds terrible but robert talks all the time about chastity but I mean much more than that. you know how I meet a girl and she feels good to me, but then only a very short time passes and I can't feel her anymore?? well, it must be significant that I can feel her -- as if it's like attracting that reality in a strong way. therefore, just like with me, no good-feeling realities should be allowed to be felt.

what I mean is that not only should it be believed that it's never going to happen, but also that the exploration of the idea in image or feeling should be, just like for me, should be discouraged.

what I'm saying is, we'll figure out how to have fun and feel good in many different ways.

---

I'm sure there are a lot of different people that are different ways, but probably the problematic ones will need to be kept as children -- away from the pleasures of life (and also from feeling good too, lol). the ones that want pleasures will find that life on their own and awaken their imagination with drugs or sex or something as the precursor to the way they want to feel. the ones that know how to feel good should be kept from feeling good so no good (unprobable) physical manifestation can occur. you know, the probability management group can never let anyone feel good enough that they're attracting a manifestation outside of the realm of possibilities.

we can never feel so good that ant good things can ever happen to us.

conclusion: if it were going to be a reality, we would feel it coming
