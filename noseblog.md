### 2021-06-18 13:45 - starting over

I decided to completely reset and start over. I shaved my head and am starting a new keyboard layout as well. it is going slow, hehe.

so many things are different and this layout isn't final at all. I'm just trying it out to see how to improve on it before using his code to make my own. I noticed that I have different finger costs than he does. I also really like the 's' on the left side, but I do like the 3 finger space in the middle. the location of the 'v' and the 'p' are super annoying though. oh yeah I hate the 'k' loc as well.

other than the kbd, I have noticed a lot of changes in how much I feel now too. earlier I had a conversation with mom about hair and it wasn't until later on that I noticed the reactions to it. I still get the reactions but they are so faint now that I'm kinda like your average dude now that it largely unaware of the reactions. it's nice be masculine again. I can just fumble around while everyone else cringes. I intend to do just that. I was thinking that there is desire for a new trump -- the ex-president.

imagine that we're all cruising along and you guys all have your manifestations (the automatons) and I remain largely how I am. you guys have the data and I continue on with my theories and ideas, of some of them are still wrong. I do like I do now where I keep updating my ideas with the feedback I get from my sixth-sense.

that means you guys get to hold the high ground with all your data and stuff and I get to be repeatedly wrong as I pontificate my way toward the better and better way of perceiving it. I don't mind being repeatedly wrong, way off-base and cringe.
