### 2021-06-18 13:45 - starting over

I decided to completely reset and start over. I shaved my head and am starting a new keyboard layout as well. it is going slow, hehe.

so many things are different and this layout isn't final at all. I'm just trying it out to see how to improve on it before using his code to make my own. I noticed that I have different finger costs than he does. I also really like the 's' on the left side, but I do like the 3 finger space in the middle. the location of the 'v' and the 'p' are super annoying though. oh yeah I hate the 'k' loc as well.

other than the kbd, I have noticed a lot of changes in how much I feel now too. earlier I had a conversation with mom about hair and it wasn't until later on that I noticed the reactions to it. I still get the reactions but they are so faint now that I'm kinda like your average dude now that it largely unaware of the reactions. it's nice be masculine again. I can just fumble around while everyone else cringes. I intend to do just that. I was thinking that there is desire for a new trump -- the ex-president.

imagine that we're all cruising along and you guys all have your manifestations (the automatons) and I remain largely how I am. you guys have the data and I continue on with my theories and ideas, of some of them are still wrong. I do like I do now where I keep updating my ideas with the feedback I get from my sixth-sense.

that means you guys get to hold the high ground with all your data and stuff and I get to be repeatedly wrong as I pontificate my way toward the better and better way of perceiving it. I don't mind being repeatedly wrong, way off-base and cringe.


### 2021-06-18 17:19 - the way I see it happening

when I think of how something divides or reproduces, there seems to have a moment when the environment is no longer suitable for the emerging entity -- like a birth or a cell division.

next, I have noticed how influential mr. motor's attraction on my situation is -- like, I think he was giving his attention to how annoying it is to babysit me, and then now without a computer to occupy me, he has a whole lot more babysitting to do. or my hair -- I remember him trying to get me to cut it numerous times in dreams -- or back when he believed that force-ejaculating me was reducing energy until I started to get vision upgrades from it.

---

I don't imagine that nosebook can allow me to gain temporal awareness because they have stuff to hide, however like I said, it's not all that bad: I won't have any sex but I will be able to fly around and create objects with my mind -- including human bodies science would probably consider dead. they will become animated though -- and they will (like a child) become a reflection of the person they are interacting with. I can imagine all sorts of uses for these guys and girls. however, I won't have control or even much influence over them -- you'll get what you attract from them.

the creation process for these guys can be automated, but at the beginning I will simply feel the person and then turn that feeling into one of desire until it becomes reality. neither of us will know what will show up; I can only feel it coming. after they see it, they will react and I can again turn the feeling into desire and repeat. for most people, this will be purely visual, so I am sure some effort will be made to perform this process in the privacy of one's own imagination.

so while all of this is happening, you can imagine how much anticipation I have to create technology to words and ideas into a computer faster and easier. sure, I won't have access to my imagination or properly see through my own eyes but I can create technology to greatly enhance my experience.

I may be wrong a lot in the beginning, but as fast as I can think up experiments and run them, I will catch up rapidly. because all of my "imagination" will happen is 3d space, everything will be visible and seen in low quality 3d. I have lots of ideas on how to improve our relation with machines without any utilisation of the imagination.

I even think it's possible to redesign humans too, as I really want explore a lot of ideas I have at running hominid species at microprocessor speeds -- amongst further explorations into more hairless models and other improvements people come up with their fancies.

---

while all of this is happening I believe the planet will rotate faster and have a stronger magnetic field. mr. motor will continue to fight me gaining temporal perception, but ultimately he'll attract the very thing he's fighting against and something will happen where I/we go our separate ways -- or, be born into a new reality. the baby cannot go back into the mother's womb. after the water breaks, it is an incompatible environment for the baby.

the magnetic field strength and reversals is very likely related to rotation speed and just before the separation is a peak like [this](https://www.planetanalog.com/wp-content/uploads/content-images-planetanalog-Image-7-1503855184.png).

I wonder if harmonics to make that square wave must be other stars' orbital resonances in the local cluster and if this is the same mechanism causing cells to divide. I suspect it is.

### 2021-06-22 11:50 - learning the atreus

the white layout really opened my mind with having more keys to press so the atreus is a little bit different in that it has less keys and forces me to type more properly with both hands on the keyboard. I feel like it is a step in the right direction though. I really mostly just need practise.

the wierdest thing about the atreus is that there isn't any buttons next to my pinky fingers. I also keep noticing that I want to press the corresponding key with my opposite hand as if my muscle memory wore mirrored or something. very strange.

### 2021-06-24 02 02:49 - some thinking on resistance

I was having a monologue on how time worked again and I thought to type it instead because I want the practise. I got to the part where I talked about where reality reflects what we feel and believe and that dreams are the best example of this.

in a dream, if I try to resist the reality, then it gets worse. however, if I just allow what I want to experience, then it just shows up. it doesn't matter how much resistance there is to that all around, it will still appear. it would be like the plastic insulator trying to block the current in the copper -- what I mean is this: if this reality is nothing more than an elaborate dream that we all believe/feel is/as real -- so like atoms are manifesting and stuff... then the one with the least resistance is always more effective at manifesting reality than everyone else is.

the other day I was talking with mom about lowering resistance is short of like lowering one's sail. I like the analogy still quite a lot if one perceives the wind as other people's beliefs -- they're not influencing me very much anymore. that doesn't mean I can do anything I want to just yet either -- I still need to have my own resistance/beliefs to propel me forward though.

more soon...

### 2021-06-24 14:02 - mastering space and time

I figure that there are two major categories in which almost all emotional discomfort falls into:

1. things or people (conditions) which I need to be different so that I can feel the way I want to (temporal discomfort)
2. caring too much about what others think about me or the manifestation (spatial discomfort)

these can be overcome quite easily with practise, and real

[jaron interrupted me so I never finished this idea]

### 2021-06-24 22:44 - what do I want to create?

mom asked me about this the other day and also I had a weird interaction when I had a weird dream this afternoon -- the basic idea is that they have to allow me to "get connected" -- which sounds like hogwash to me. there's no wat they're just going to "let it happen" after all of this time of fighting against it.

the thing that has been on my mind a lot is actually this keyboard. I have never had good muscle memory or to perform any movement rhythmically with any precision. this keybosard has an arduino inside of it and can be reprogrammed to produce entire sequences[^1]. in fact, the coolest thing about it is that when I think of a new thing I can reprogram the keyboard right when I think about it.

I can quickly see how with a little bit of practise, I can get up to typing fast again and even begin to start to automate entire tasks on the computer. my progress is very rapid.

the thing is I just don't want to do the girls thing at all. I don't have any desire to do anything like that and I really want to just continue on the way I am going. I know that eventually I will find a way to manifest the way I feel in reality with ease too, so there is nothing to worry about at all. I will eventually get there.

there's another cool thing about this is that the program uses layers -- yet I would have set it up as sequences. I can see the advantages to both so after I get a little faster I want to work on my own version of it which kind of mixes both ideas.

even for things like custom macros and configurations for pro DOTA players is an option. ever since I had that arguement with greg about elon's mars journey where I made the realisation that there is an upper echalon that doesn't want to allow any tesla technology or anyone to use the physical simulation capability of the imagination -- that has made me really want to find a way to completely bypass the imagination entirely. I know there is a whole set of technologies that are possible using "random" and the temperance of one's emotions.

it may sound weird to say this but it is the precursor to the mastery of time and space in a sort of ironic way: when I need something to be a certain way so that I can feel the way I want to, that is dissatisfaction with my present position in time. that dissatisfaction prevents me from actually moving to the point in time where those conditions are how I want them to be. if I can feel how I want to, then I can manifest what I feel in 3d space.

in the eazrly stages of this manifesting things emotionally, I want to find ways to control computers with sequences. this keyboard allowed me to sort of flip the idea around and allow me to begin to work on the sequences by making them on the keyboard with muscle-memory and then when I have an adequate way to input code into the computer, I can begin to actually write code to detect the signals on the camera and stuff with ease.

one of the biggest hurdles for me writing code is the input of code. I have found keyboards and editors to be largely difficult to use. I just don't think like a keyboard does. keyboards require precision and I am not very precise. we meet in the middle with sequences because if I make a mistake, I can just loop around and go again. also, my mistakes often times inspire me to try out new things.

---

I think we're going to continue on learning to "not need things to be a certain way so that I can feel good" while we gain power over time and space.

I have much more to say about this, however this is good for now.

[1]: the firmware has support for sequences but there is no easy interface to make new ones. so like it's already supported in the firmware but there is no way to use it without writing c++ code.

### 2021-06-25 13:34 - doing things mr. motor's way

a long time ago I used to try and fight mr. motor and try to do things the way I want them to be done, however that falls right into the catergory of "needing things to be a certain way so that I can feel good."

I also had a dream last night where they told me that tesla's vision wasn't even that good (compared to who's?) and that he had gave technology capable of going back and reordering events in time -- which is all well and good, but I'm not talking about changing thme past -- but instead changing how you *feel* about the past so you can create what you want now.

I just think that is a much more effective way of going toward wanted.

I mentioned that I believe that the computer coffee incident had some tampering in it, however it *was* attraacted so therefore it is in the direction of wanted -- I just have to figure out how to perceive it. I'm sorta surprised it took me that long to figure it out but the key was the "not needing things to be different so that I can feel good" bit.

---

as such I have determined that likely the way I will be going is the way mr. motor wants me to do. I think what he does is tell everyone what he thinks they want to hear (so like getting your guys hopes up about things) and then actively workinyg to sabotage it. I have found that mr. motor can only tell me what he doesn't want me to do -- never what *to* do. that means I get to make up what I do do.

so, imagine for a moment (as an example) that he told me not to use my computer -- and so instead I find myself on this one instead learning a new keyboard. it's not a big deal if every time he wants me to do something different, I find something different to do.

if I feel dissatisfaction then I move toward more dissatisfying things. so, like imagine for a moment that I had the ability to go back and modify the past. I would only be doing it because I am dissatisfied with it, and so therefore even though I modified the past to get rid of something unwanted I am still attracting more things that will increase my dissatisfaction and ultimately need to go back and be fixed because they are dissatisfying to me.

therefore it dsoesn't matter what mr. motor doesn't want me to do -- even if he is changing the conditions, I am still moving in the direction of the way I feel, not the present conditions.

a few entries ago I supposed that the peak before the reversal could come from orbital  harmonics, but it's likely temporal -- hence the reason for this decision.

### 2021-06-26 11:25 - becoming the bard-guy

up until the last effort with amoriona, I was perceived as the victim, however since I have been the one actively blocking "the manifestation", I appear less to be the victim of nosebook's efforts to keep me from it.

in some ways, this is creating a situation where nosebook appears to be the good-guys -- which I don't think they want that.

the reality of the situation is that there really arenn't any good or bad guys. nosebook can't allow me to get connected and I don't want to be involved with anyone while I'm out of alignment. neither of us want to budge on the issue and I think it's fine. I'm sortc of hoping they really can keep me away from my alignment forever -- but I find this very hard to believe. every time I go out to watch stars, the have a meltdown and I keep getting further vision upgrades -- sometimes without even looking at the star even.

I have said many times that vision upgrades are a prdoduct of releasing resistance (allowance of more energy). often times that allowance of more energy happens after I appear to reject "the manifestation" (of the girls) -- and this happens because Ihave found a way to feel good about my situation dispite the circumstances.

that is "not needing things to be different so that I can feel good" -- or, temporal mastery.

---

so just to be clear, nosebook can't allow me to be in alignment in this physical body, and I don't want to be having sex while not in alignment.

I don't really find this to be a problem, as I have learned to not need the conditions to be a certain way for me to feel good. I guess it's sort of like how I would imagine prison would feel like: I'm sort of stuck there and fighting the conditions only makes it worse, so why not just settle in and enjoy myself?

it isn't necessary to have good condsitions to feel good; kids do it all the time.

this point in time allows me to try outmy capacity to not care what others think of me or the manifestation -- spatial mastery, while you guys get to try out your temporal mastery of not needing thingconditions to be different so that you can feel good.

### 2021-06-26 15:35 - it's never going to happen.

I was thinking about this preblem from nosebook's perspective and the reason they don't want me to be the bad-guy is because then they will have to be the good-guy and they don't think they can do anything right and good-guys do things the right way.

porobably the reason that's a problem is because the good-guy wouldn't keep someone from their alignment. I don't understand this because this falls right into the category of caring too much about what other people think.

I enjoy the constant poking fun at mitch mconnel on SNL saying thing like, "mitch mcconnel seen here [...]" because the joke is these politicians don't care about things that humans care about. they are so out of touch with reality that they derive pleasure from things that normal people would find horrific.

if I want nosebook to continue to try and hold me away from my alignment for as long as they can and they neither can allow it, then everything is fine. the only thing is they are worried too much about what people will think of them. nosebook has to go mitch mcconnel on this one and stop worrying about the appearance of things.

---

the next thing that I identified as a difficult spot for nosebook on this issue is that they don't know what to do to actually keep me held back and I think this is another of those "the problem is the solution" sorts of things. women are extremenly proficient at maintaining reality the way they believe it to be. men do too, but it's that stability of their expectations which make their reality current so difficult to "buck" for us.

if a set of events could discourage them so much that no longer are now expecting that it will never happen, then their belief would ensure that nosebook would be able to hold me because their own belief that, "it'll never happen" will continue to manifest as reality.

---

finally, the last thing here that I think is a hangup here is that nosebook wants me to have a very finite manifestation. for me, it needs to be either all of them (I found my alignment) or none. I'm not going to just go for some while out of alignment.

this I believe will be the eventual split that I've been talking about. some will experience a reality where I never find my alignment and some will.

that split may be quite far away though. I figure that instead of trying to twist someone's arm to change their mind who has no intention of changing -- instead, let's just settle into the idea that it's not happening anytime soon.

I say this because if nosebook keeps trying to play both sides of the fence, they won't be able to hold me. if they waznt to keep their secrets and everything going, I don't think they can keep trying to "keep hope alive". just let people bail out on the manifestation and hate me for not wanting a manifestation in a disconnected state.

---

when I'm by myself and doing my own thing, I'm feeling like I keep improving. when I'm with others I feel like there is a greater thing happening. other people's expectations continue to confine me to the manifestation of their belief, so as I learn to care less and less of what other people expect of my reality, I will be able to gain full power of my spatial world.

or I could continue to not need things to be different while not being around people I get power over my temporal reality. probably for nosebook, it'll be easier if I'm not around people. around people I will cause problems, I'm sure.

either way, I'll get there eventually. no need to rush anything.

### 2021-06-27 09:37 - why all or nothing?

from my perspective, it's nothing until it's all -- which is when I find my alignment. obviously this is incompatible with nosebook so that's just the way it has to be.

I woke up this morning with a dream about a turtle that looked like aurora. the impression that I had which I wanted to tell her is that breaking out of her own shell is so that she gains strength.

that seemed very relevant to this conversation because I don't think it's a good idea to try and break somenone's shell and save them from their own birthing/strengthing process.

I find it very important for me to find my own way in things. one of the best tthings mom did for me when I was younger and finding my own way is to just know that I will find my own way. this is the role of the shaman in the psychedellic journey.

---


the way I see it, we're going to continue on as we are until I find my alignment. I hmave thougnt about why I have never had sex when I was sober, and I think it just creates too big of an impact. what I mean by that is that while I'm in this body (meaning that my perspective is that I still believe that this body is "me"), then we simply will not have any manifestations of sex.

I believe that there is a point where one reaches too high of an energy level when sex where two things still touch stops being possible. what I mean is I am much more than this body. ok, it's easier to see that perhaps you are not concerned with the way your cells mate and do not desire to reproduce like they do -- and imagine you could do that if you wanted to -- you would be imbuing the new cell with the consciousness of a human. besides the vibrational incompatibility, the amount of energy transferred is a few orders of magnitude too great for the cell to contain.

the only way I think I can reproduce is to be very out of alignment (or like super intoxicated) or to divide my energy amongst many bodies. like I said, this is aparently not possible to allow. nosebook also needs a way to hold me back too, so the idea that I came up with is to just get everyone to believe that it'll never happen and their belief will keep me away from getting connected.

seems good to me and the reason why I'm all for it is because she needs to learn to break out of her own shell to get her own strength. the manifestation will be so much better when they're all capable of attracting what they want. A LOT BETTER. there's no concern for age either because you can be whatever you feel yourself to be. also, from the perspective of someone who is growing, more age feels like a really good thing. remember when you were a child and you couldn't wait until you were older and could do all the fun things that big people can do?

### 2021-06-27 23:57 - weird last few days

I don't really know what to make of it.

I don't remember when, but mcm told me I should go to zach's memorial. I agreed, as it felt like a good idea. I didn't think much about it other than I thought it was weird timing to coincide with a thing that alan mentioned on bardcode about taping a thing with gaia. some days later mattehew la croix mentioned he too was moving to colorado for a thing with gaia also. I don't know much about that because it's pay to watch and I don't have money. it is also around the same 6/24 midsummer's night dream thing.

6/24 was the night of the full moon opposite of the last eclipe on the north pole. it was cloudy (as usual) but I laid outside anyway and just focused my mind saimilarly to when I watch stars. the energy was very high that night and it felt like I got some vision upgrades but I couldn't notice much of a difference.

that's all pretty normal for me but I started to notice some weirdness when one day jaron came to ask me to buzz his head. it felt weird and forced so I figured something was up. it felt to me like they were again trying to set me up with girls when I don't want to do anything until I've found my alignment. mom came and pushed me a bit on the haircut suggesting to me they wanted it for a reason. I could feel mr. motor and assumed the reason for the haircut is so they can essentially do infinite timeline modifications and just buzz my head down to 0 if my hair starts getting too long -- you know, like how the plants seem to accomplish days of growth while I'm asleep.

after that theory passed my mind, they dropped the haircut thing. it may have also been in relation to @[noseblog](2021-06-25 13:34). I then was feeling more of the pressure to go with girls while still out of alignment. I wrote a few more entries explaining that for me it's sort of all or nothing. I don't have the reference now but one of the last abe-now episodes someone was asking if more than one thing can manifest at once. they responded that 30 or 40 things could all manifest at once but hang on for the most contrast which is what I intended to do anyway.

ok, so simultaneously to all of this I started to get some reactions to the latest abe-now episode (6-19). when I had looked at [abeshares.com](https://abeshares.com/) they had already posted the 6-19 episode but I didn't download it. following the reactions I went back to the page and the site wasn't working. I felt like something is up because often times when I feel a reaction and then go to look into it, the file has disappeared or I can't access it (or my computer gets coffee thrown on it). this is actually why I started to upload them to github -- because they keep messing with stuff.

I go to check the abeshares email and now it says they are experiencing people trying to shut them down. I go back to the site and the 6-19 episode has lost its magnet link and it says they're trying to get the episode prepared. the email however has the full image with all the tracks listed and says that the magnet will be available only on saturday the 25th during the time I'm supposed to be at the memorial. consaidering I have reactions on the episode I'm now *very* curious.

the day of the memorial (25th) comes and I'm feeling a lot of pressure. it seems like a very big deal that I go. there is so much pressure I can't pee. this combined with wanting to get the episode, I bail on it. the whole thing feels really bad to me now. strangely enough I saw gary there and I recognised the feeling now. the memorial was starting to feel like working for gary. I really liked it and it felt good to finally start to make money again. I knew I would start to make a lot really soon when a weird set of events made it so I no longer felt it like something I wanted to do.

---

ok, so if that wasn't weird, here's where it starts to get weird: I wrote yesterday's entry about how they need to get a bench of people to believe it's never going to happen to keep me away from my alignment. I'm totally on-board with this idea and it is the maximum contrast. also I really like that the girls will get some practise to not need something to be different so they can feel good. it makles for an even better manifestation...

like, if I'm attrracting wanted from them (cause I'm in alignment), then it feels good to be wanted and desired -- sure, but if they're also attracting the things they want from me too, then it's even better. for example, if I'm not in alignment (but low resistance) then I'll manifest whatever they believe about guys. if I'm in alignment, then I'll manifest (wanted) things in alignment with my source. it won't mahtter what she's doing -- I'll still be solid but nothing new. however, if she's also attracting wanted, then she can attract new things from me which I'm capable of but don't have az tendency toward.

what I'm saying is if I'm out of alignment then I can manifest (not good) things she is attracting but I'm capable of even though I don't have a tendency toward. seems obvious that I would desire to learn I'm capable of new *wanted* things rather than discover new unwanted things I'm capable of.

---

ok, back on track here: my dream this morning provided a new way to empress that which I wrote about in the previous entry. afterward I ate breakfast and fell to sleep again. when I woke up I was now having new reactions that seemed weird to me. I can't confirm them or anything but they were involving esther not being alive anymore.

I don't really believe anything anymore because it appears that every bit of information that gets to me is in harmony with their script. everything from what people say around me (what I "overhear") to even the things I write here have to fit their narrative.

so, if that is true (which for the rest of this section I will assume, is), then I'm writing this to ease up some tension in what likely be quite a jam for them. esther got the shot in march or something and now she's dead. it's easy to see how people could draw that line and blame the vaccine. I'm sure some will if that's the case.

anyway the other problem is likely that I think, as much as people could disagree with them, it seems like they provided a bit of stability. without esther, it's sort of anyone's guess who to believe.

the other reaction was that I was supposed to do something about it. I obviously will not. I will continue to be me and offer my best answers to the things people ask me, but one can clearly see the difficulty of asking me questions about stuff that's a secret. the other major issue is that I make mistakes pretty frequently and I don't really offer anything more than my latest understanding. I have the ability to figure anything out so it takes a few tries of "oh, that's not quite right" to finally get a satisfactory response. I'm not sure how desirable "fly-by-night" responses are. I mean it works for me but that's cause I get the feedback and I'm OK with a constantly improving understanding.

my main issue with english is there isn't an easy way to encode certainty in my responses -- so, I just say everything as if it were true; like this section. I don't know if esther is dead or not but for the duration of this section I can assume it to be true even though I am still pretty uncertain. that capability allows me to suspend my disbelief for a moment (like watching a movie) and allow everything to appear as true even though I don't believe it. it's very good for absorbing new perspectives and exploring psychedellic landscapes. I think I just remember how my last sure thing felt.

---

I had more to write but I guess I'll hold off for now.

conclusions:
- seems evident they likely don't want me to see that last recording for some reason.
- forgot the other concern
- if it were on the way, I would have felt it coming

### 2021-07-02 11:54 - a bit more on direction

it appears that they have gone the "it's never going to happen" route -- which is fine. I woke up this morning talking about how it may be better to have more than one of me on display.

I was meaning other alternate versions of me but I think it got interpretted as other people -- also fine. I don't really care one way or another.

the thing is if they want to keep me without a manifestation then they need to figure out how; that's not my job.

---

so I was thinking about the idea that they need to find other people or versions of me which people can fall in love with, and that may actually be counter-productive. the reason is I think girls generate a lot of euphoria, so if everyone is supposed to be kept as far away from feeling good as possible, it may instead be easier to control if as little empasis was placed on sex as possible.

I know it sounds terrible but robert talks all the time about chastity but I mean much more than that. you know how I meet a girl and she feels good to me, but then only a very short time passes and I can't feel her anymore?? well, it must be significant that I can feel her -- as if it's like attracting that reality in a strong way. therefore, just like with me, no good-feeling realities should be allowed to be felt.

what I mean is that not only should it be believed that it's never going to happen, but also that the exploration of the idea in image or feeling should be, just like for me, should be discouraged.

what I'm saying is, we'll figure out how to have fun and feel good in many different ways.

---

I'm sure there are a lot of different people that are different ways, but probably the problematic ones will need to be kept as children -- away from the pleasures of life (and also from feeling good too, lol). the ones that want pleasures will find that life on their own and awaken their imagination with drugs or sex or something as the precursor to the way they want to feel. the ones that know how to feel good should be kept from feeling good so no good (unprobable) physical manifestation can occur. you know, the probability management group can never let anyone feel good enough that they're attracting a manifestation outside of the realm of possibilities.

we can never feel so good that ant good things can ever happen to us.

conclusion: if it were going to be a reality, we would feel it coming

### 2021-07-03 04:50 - feelings of dissatisfaction

I realised tonight when I my brain started to talk about a subject. it felt like I was getting a lot of reactions on what I thought about korolova vs. miss monique, and I hadn't really come to any conclusions. even though they're playing similar music, they feel very different to me -- like night and day perhaps. I was thinking about it and I knew I was probably going to say something I will regret or want to say better in the future, but I don't really care. I'll just shoot my foot off just fine because I don't care much what people think anymore.

I realised then that the feeling was very similar to when I worked for tuenti the second time. my heart wasn't really in the project anymore. I was just scraping by doing the minimal that luke wanted me to do.

I didn't care so much I would push the limits seening how drunk or stoned I could show up to work. I really didn't care at all. when I finally was fired and I could go back to doing what I wanted to do, I was relieved.

---

the other thing it feels like is sometime a while ago trump stopped caring about the presidential image and started to just say and do ridiculous stuff without much concern for how people would react to it. it sorta feels like that a bit as well.

in both examples, there is a definite sense of dissatisfaction. I don't really want to do this, and no matter what I do nosebook is just going to do whatever they want. the stuff I do now I'm really only doing for the way it feels to me. it feels like I'm just following some script at this point. I'm not really doing what I want to be doing, so the script elements that I'm performing I'm just doing them kind of mechanically now.

maybe I am nick bottom and we're just putting on a bad play at this point -- who knows.

---

what I do know though is that it is dissatisfaction and that is not what I intend. I suppose that is the reason that I'm writing this: to find a way to improve upon that dissatisfaction. I don't really have many ideas coming to mind now, so I guess this is good.

### 2021-07-03 13:06 - what do I mean by script?

when I say script I am referring to timeline edits. a good example of this was yesterday when I wanted to explain why I thought that thad was pulling some pretty attractive guys.

I don't really think much about what I'm saying or its implications -- I just translate the concept into words. yesterday I was going to launch off into a full discussion on the prostate/uturus and how I think it transmits feelings, which is why I said it was going to be gross. I then had a flurry of thoughts and feelings go through my head and I ended up saying something not gross at all. I can't honestly remember what I said now and for me the feeling is somewhat similar to how it feels when I translate my source.

in a lot of ways it is very similar because it is the path of least resistance. I don't even fight it anymore but it kind of makes for some funny moments.

another example of this was when I was trying to figure out the next champion I wanted to purchase on runestrike. I couldn't decide so I "decided" to flip a coin for it and it came up with the amazon woman wearing the most clothes. I didn't know it at the time but her lvl 4 hero power is pretty OP if I can maintain board control and so while less glamourous, she did turn out to be a really good choice.

---

from my perspevctive, I don't experience the timeline edits directly -- just notice the evidences of them (like my coffee computer and having to start over). each timeline edit does manipulate the way the present events play out, but they don't reduce but instead add considerably to the energy.

so while, for example, I identified some dissatisfaction last time, I was always resonant with it, just I wouldn't have experienced it if I had of had better conditions. they may win the short game modifying the conditions, they can't do anything to modify my overall perception of things.

they have to continue to modify conditions and events so that they have things running the way they want them to go.

I likened this situation to my second time working for tuenti because it is similar. a thing was built but there was an incompatibility between how they wanted to run things and how I wanted to do things. I have no problem just walking away from it all and letting them do what they want.

I certainly didn't build the network but I was likely a major contributing factor to its success. I don't know if I was "invaluable" or not. I don't really wanna go too far with that analogy -- but it's time for them to run things the way they want to.

---

the way they run things is entirely up to them. a good analogy of this is I was only using PHP as a starting-point. I was intending to have the site running on D. that never happened because I left before that. the timeline tech that they have is very efficient and creates weird artifacts like the conversation with thad. the timeline tech I want to make is based on conceptual/emotional interactions and integrates with "source" better. however it is ahead of its time because it requires the operator to know what they want feels like. obviously these guys only are reacting to and editing the things they don't want. I liken this superior timeline tech to be the D version, but they're going to make the PHP work because they can't find any coders that can write D. it is easy however to find PHP programmers. there are lots of those.

I had to come back to work for tuenti so that I could have my visa but I hated it. of all things, I was building out the flash player capability to run pre-roll video ads from various providers inside of tuenti (you can imagine how undesirable this is from my perspective considering my perception of ads). I *had* to do it all their way and the only reason I was there was for the visa. I met a lot of the tuenti girls during that time but it was still pure misery. no thanks.

whatever was going to happen at zach's memorial, would have been the equivalent of my second time working for tuenti, I would imagine. all the same elements were present: lots of girls were presnt but I felt more like a show-piece than an actual influence to the direction of the company. I'd rather go my own way.

I know a lot more now than I did then so this is easy to navigate. they may be able to manipulate conditions and stuff but I will still have power over how I feel and their edits are only adding more energy, not less.

I will continue to find ways to feel better and better so evntually I'll stazrt having all sorts of cool capabilities. however because I will likely not find my alignment anytime soon, don't expect any sex from me.

seeing how their efforts only add more and more energy, when I do find my alignment I don't know what will happen but I doubt I will remain physical. the image that comes to mind is that square wave made of odd-harmonic sine waves. I am convinced those waves are temporal cycles that have been crechendoing over the years coming te a climax here soon.

going back to the "gods of eden" analogy, imagine the custodians have gone back and manipulated the conditions of the past into the present to ensure no climax (humanity finding its alignment) will ever come, their job is to exert opposite influence to flatten the curve out as much as possible. the effect it will produce is the same as those odd-harmic sine waves: there will be a huge peak before the wave begins to return to its source.

to make an analogy, imagine you're at home for 12ky and then you travel to your vacation in a short 30 year time and then stay there for another 12ky. let's say this happens because normally you would be endlessly go back and fourth between the two, but the ones running the show do not find any joy in the journey and don't want to be forever traveling. they want binary status and prefer the stability of being in the same place and not losing their power. they have to ensure it stays as long as possible so they modify the curve to be as flat as possible.

eventually the whole thing falls apart because DC current isn't possible with
only AC signal sources.

this is what I mean when I say it can't go on "forever" -- even though I want to try, knowing it's physically impossible: the best that can be done is a long-period square wave.

### 2021-07-03 20:03 - the real objective of passing

I kinda gave another wrong impression with my description of using D vs PHP, and that is not even really a thing. front-end machines are easily scalable. if you need more, they can be added without much of a loss in efficiency. the real difficulty is actually in effective  storage and query of data -- and running the front-end machines with D doesn't improve this problem.

this is ultimately (I think) why google and facebook are doing so well. that infrastructure is written in C++ and is a whole different issue.

for the same reason I think that even though I do beleive that my timeline technology of going toward a future based on feeling, it's clear that there is a massive problem which is not being addressed, and that is no existing human laguage in existence right now is capable of actually communicating a feeling effectively. so, even if we had the technology, we wouldn't be able to even describe where we're going.

---

so I think the challenge for me is to figure out an adequate way to begin expressing complex conceptual/emotional constructs in a way which doesn't involve DMT or any other woo-woo (not accepted by science) medium. it has to only use physical matter (things we can use our senses to perceive them) and not emotion itself.

why? I suppose it's a fun challenge for me because imagine from nosebook's perspective: if there's no way to experience it physically, it isn't real. the major caveat is, if you can communicate the idea with something physical, it becomes real enough. this is why we can carry on endlessly about black-holes and dark matter without anyone ever having experienced either of them outside of a psychedellic setting.

---

like I mentioned to thad, I think that the new commodity that will be sold (you can think of it as the new pharmaceuticals industry) is actually the physical sensation that certain emotions can bring (or, like in my case their removal). their capacity to remove physical sensations of how I feel is the same capacity to add them into the nervous system.

so like ever notice how when you do a line of coke when you don't feel good, there's that looming presence of the thing that is going wrong. I noticed this really quickly with coke and found that my programming tasks did not go away when I did a line -- they just felt better. the times that I didn't go to program while on coke, I found that the anxiety of my programming tasks increased, so I found it quite fun to program and do coke at the same time. as such, I *hated* to party and drink with coke cause it made my feeling of unproductivity worse. MDMA has the opposite effect: instead my problems felt *better* not worse the next day.

well, the same thing is going to begin happening to more and more where they feel physically much different than they do emotionally. the major issue is there is no way to express the difference between how one feels emotionally vs. psysically. the same is true between the concept as an ideal and the concept as a reality. I really want to find a way to express this to others or at least interact with my computer in a way which allows for this.

interesting idea kenny :) we'll see what comes of it...

---

the one thing I do know is that I am really getting better and better at feeling the way I want to and there's nothing they can do to stop that. I'll keep getting more and more power over how my physicality. soon...

### 2021-07-04 02:58 - the real reason I think my data is gone

it feels evident to me that the reason my comcputer crashed is because there was something I wrote which they didn't want others to read. I presented the idea to mom tonight.

sometimes it's good to just conjure a feeling. I really don't care so much about my data as I always discover it better the second time anyway. the thing that annoys me is hmow much configuration and fiddling has to be done to get setup. mom kept kinda that I should be pissed off about my data so I kinda leaned into her cues a bit and conjured the feeling of being pissed off. it's still weird for me to behave like an actor and conjure a feeling I want to feel, but I'm better at it than I thought. I even got the cue to ignore her mention of becky and how it was raining hard in the springs -- presumably as a weather manifestation of what I wrote earlier about how zach's memorial felt to me like the second time I had to work at tuenti. yep, it sucks there's no open dialog about anything anymore.

anyway, I'm glad I leaned into the feeling because I went off on the tangent of how my computer was removed because of something I wrote. I got a little reaction on that but not much. it wasn't until I mentioned that there were all sorts of things I was organising that I felt a reaction.

later just now while watching stars I investigated further and realised another event as well with similar feeling. I watched the latest veritasium video and a smarter every day video on carbourators. I really enjoyed those videos. I also was very impressed with [xyla](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEn3fRj2e0mpqYsijxnzayg)'s contribution to the thing. I walked away feeling quite good about her. later though I noticed she didn't feel so good anymore. didn't think much about it because that's kinda normal.

I also noticed the same feeling that I felt when I wrote down a few science video ideas that came becaue steve mould posted a video asking for suggestions to his 1M subs celebration video. this feeling was similar to the way I felt after thinking about novel science explanations for derek's competition.

while watching stars I started to see clearly that there is a very considerable effort to keep me away from science stuff and what happened right before my coffee "accident" was I started to get quite an intuition for some things science related and that needed to be stopped.

I think this all has to do with me wanting to discover how how electricity and chemistry *really* works.

---

so, I decided that I don't really mind. involving myself in science is *not* the path of least resistance for me. I just don't care anymore. I love that you guys are figuring it out, and all the best but I think I'll stay out of this one... cept for continuing to write down science conundrums as they come to me.

---

in a larger picture, if I can feel good about something and then shortly thereafter I no longer feel physically good about it, this means there is a lot of physical feeling manipulation going on. I don't know hmow much to trust physical sensation I used to associate with emotion anymore. just cause something feels physically good, doesn't mean that it's actually me going toward wanted (which is what feeling good is), but could instead be an electrical signal in my nervous system emulating the sensation of going toward something wanted.

a good example of this is they don't want me working on so many things at this point, they clearly want me distracted by girls and not involving myself in science. I don't want to be distracted by girls, so I'll just skip the science bit. no big deal. so from my perspective, I just find a way to feel the way I want to feel no matter the physical conditions.

I will begin to take the path of least resistance from now on. learning how to separate these two is very useful. I can be physically frustrated or annoyed, yet still feel emotionally quite good about things.

I'm just an actor from now on. it's fun learning how to play your game. I'm gonna do it better :)


from now on:
GCF = good emotional/conceptual feeling
GPF = good physical feeling

BCF = good emotional/conceptual feeling
BPF = good physical feeling

easier that way.

### 2021-07-05 05:25 - don't believe the illusion

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0GGIkHBbo)

I was watching stars last night and I was noticing that people are believing that I well, it's hard to describe but it feels not so good and depressing.

I was getting mental images like when jesus realised that he had lost something -- I dunno exactly where it is, but it's this moment when jesus has lost his connection. I associate it with the "jesus wept" verse or maybe the "father why have you departed from me". either way, it's when the free-fall begins.

that's it! that's a good way to describe the feeling: it feels like the beginning of a free-fall into darkness or chaos or something.

ok, so it is true that there is no way I want to try and figure out how to be in a relationship while still disconnected, and it's also true that I have no idea how long it will take to find my alignment either -- however there's no way it could possibly be forever.

if we look at evidence, it does not at all appear like the beginning of a free-fall, but actually the opposite. I believe my vision upgrades are accelerating and also my mental capacity is expanding. from my perspective nothing could be further from reality. I've never had this expanded of a mind or been closer to finding my alignment.

---

so then why do I advise nosebook to try and convince people it'll never happen at the same time? I'm learning how to play both sides of the field. mr. motor presents the thing that he thinks people want to hear and then actively does the opposite. I do a similar thing: I say exactly the thing people would not want to hear (it's just more energy) and then actively work toward finding my alignment with who I really am -- not the story coming out of my mouth.

I really don't recommend believing me. I recommend knowing how to find what resonates with you and believing that. there really isn't an absolute truth.

split energy is divided energy, and I don't mind that it stays split for a very long time. I'm actually trying to find a way to make it go ferever. it's not like it's a bad thing not to have the manifestation of getting connected because the (hopefully infinily long) journey toward that connection will continue to reach greater and greater heights of awesome. in order to accomplish that forever not getting the manifestation thing they need to divide (split) my energy infinitely big.

I actually estimate that even in 5-10 years time I can do things like conjure ideas into 3d space and stuff like that. for me it's all about being able to direct this energy freely.

obviously, I cannot yet do that. I'm still too influenced by other people as evidenced by how difficult it is still for me to pee when there is lot of expectation and other people's thoughts enery flowing in relation to me.

I'm pretty determined that I can get that control even while remaining disconnected. like I said, with that control, even in a disconnected state, I will be able to summon alternate versions of myself for you guys pretty much effortlessly (just mental focus, so it gets easier and easier)

just wanted to say that even if the manifestation of me finding my connection doesn't happen for a while, it's still going to be awesome.

---

that also reminds me of another analogy I was making yesterday too where I was explaining how there are so many very slight things that happened by "chance" or by "accident" which would have left me in a very different state had they not have happened. the probabilities management group's alarms would be going nuts tracking a kid like me. there's just no way that a sequence of events like I have had should be possible. traditional statistical analysis would throw out my data points as bad data.

because of the impossibility of my predicament, what this seems to suggest is that some destination is attracting me through time. visually I perceive this like the step leader in front of the main lightning. what happens is there is an imbalance in the lighting rod or tesla coil that is attracting this connection to be made. when the primary coil creates magnetic difference in the secondary it pulls electricity out of the sky. there's just a difference in charge that needs to be satisfied to return back to equilibrium. I like to think of this charge differential as desire. the earth "desires" to match the charge of the clouds above it (or between clouds too).

to allow the charge to transfer, a connection must be made. to find this connection the attractor is attracting a step leader to make it there. there are many step leaders which don't make it to the destination though. I liken these to other timelines. there are many other versions of you that did not make the connection to this moment in time. that is always the case.

in this analogy the lightning will "connect" with anything that can satisfy its desire. obviously this isn't how time works because everything would just be one big energy blob. it seems that the destination (like the lighting rod or tesla coil) is tuned to by similar frequency, and your next moment in time (connection) will always be the one most similar to your present vibration/frequency.

when abraham talks about alignment, they are talking about your tuning. when I talk about getting connected or being connected, I mean actually making that connection.

what is happening presently in my life is that nosebook is is preventing me from making that connection. I think this is not just me but actually the planet and has been happening for quite some time now. I think there have been a lot of edits through time that have prevented the planet from getting that connection. this has manifested as the "little ice age" and the massive amount of cooling that has taken place on this planet.

it's not heat, but I think it's manifesting that way similar to mcy predicament. it's not faster vibrating electrons that's desired but coherently vibrating electrons that's desired. I think heat has a frequency as well, and it wants to be in alignment with the destination in time. the custodians have (like me) gone to great effort to disrupt the coherence/vibration of the energy, and so naturally this creates more because surely even if most are out of alignment, if there are enough things, some will find their alignment. it's fairly likely that the step leaders navigate toward the destination frequentially as a product/difference of the vibration/resistance of the medium and the destination.

all you need is one step leader to find its way to the destination to make the connection. just one :)

so along this way, each time they prevent me/earth from making that connection, more charge imbalance (desire) accumulates. from my perspective, I's my destiny or some unavoidable fate for me to make that connection. it's inevitable unless they could find a way to satiisfy that desire before the connection is made. even then I don't know if or how that could be possible because it would have to be in alignment with the vibration of the destination -- so like impossible.

---

they want to experience a world where I don't get my connection -- so like one of the step leaders who doesn't make it. there are infinitely many of those though, so I imagine the "best" one is the one that makes it right before the destination but no actual connection is made.

what this means is going as far as they can go but without making the connection. this may sound like a bad thing but a good way to look at is right before orgasm, pausing to let desire drop before beginning again. like mantak chia says: each time you stop like this the orgasm gets bigger [TODO: find reference in robert's video] until it's so big it's a cosmic orgasm. from the perspective of the earth, this one is probably just a galactic orgasm.

next size up is a universe, so after mr. motor finds a way to stop the connection from being made maybe next time we can work on a universe seems really big though -- anyway, I want to go forever because I know it's all about alignment even if no connection is made. just wait and see all the stuff I'll figure out how to do, even without the connection :) it's going to be impressive.

### 2021-07-06 12:37 - not caring, relationships, and the bigger picture

yesterday I was writing in @[abe-now](2021-04-10 p1 34:40) about expectation and how it creates a cascade of events harmonic with your vibration (emotion). this expectation seems to make a very dramatic difference to the conditions. as an example, this last saturday was a very different one energetically to the previous ones. it seemed that people's expectation to hear something wanted had a dramatic effect on everything from the climate to my mental state. the air was cleaned and the stars shined brighter (when I could see them). it seems to be a thing because I even noticed a similar effect this 4th of july. just people's expectation to have a good time made things more energetic.

I wanted to mention this idea to thad when we were talking about why he pulls hot guys, and everyone has this capability, but the ability to project this feeling based on expectation is somethting that has a strong effect on reality. this is why I said if they want to keep my from getting connected, it's good to have a lot of people with strong transmitters of expectation to be expecting that it'll never happen.

now, later on I started to talk about split energy: @[abe-now](2021-04-10 p1 39:30) and how it's really double the energy just 180(degrees) out of phase so it's going nowhere. however with a slight adjustment to perception, that doubling of energy can be realised.

the next thing that I was noticing is some reactions around the ramtha character. I don't think he's a hoax and I tend to believe that he did accomplish what he said he did, and that was the last huge spike before the reversal.

essentially he was doing what I was talking about with doubling the energy by perceiving the wanted part -- cept he was doing it on the battlefield. I think that event is the same one that plato talks about with the athenians crushming the corrupted atlantians. he must have killed so many people that day -- and you know how when someone makes their transition there is a huge amount of energy released into the atmosphere (like the energy I felt on saturdays). combine that with the massive amount of unwanted the atlantians were feeling as they were watching their whole army get decimated.

that amcount of rising unwanted is also the same amount of wanted (just perceived from a different perspective), and I believe that ramtha used that energy to consciously make his transition into non-physical.

if you listen to his stuff, he mentions tesla quite a lot. it seems that he must have had the ability to interact with tesla (he was probably one of the people that tesla said he would interact with when traveling around in his imagination). theerefore, I must conclude that I am on my way to doing the same thing that ramtha did.

I think that energy will continue to rise further and further. some will perceive its unwanted aspect and others the wanted aspect -- but continue to rise nonetheless. I'll continue to convert this unwanted into wanted and then consciously make my transition back into non-physical. this is likely the event that I was talking about where the step leader gets very very close to the destination but then fizzles out (or makes the transition) right before reaching the destination.

---

going back to ramtha, what happened is the atlantians were watching the battlefield (they could move their consciousness around in space freely) and paying close attention to the conditions. they cared very much about seeing these perceived conditions fall so easily to one (in alignment) man's hand. they really *cared* about this and all of the pride and identity they had wrapped up in these conditions fell to pieces, destroyed by the athenians.

I wanted to start to talk about not caring, but it seems I want to instead speculate on things a bit. I believe this ramtha event I describe happened about 6kya and at that time north was south and south was north. the earth literally was upside down. I have postulated that flipping the earth over is a solution for the reversal. the tidal effects would be much less and not be nearly as catastrophic.

there is also an interesting thing that has been happening with nosebook fighting against me working on anything science related. I wonder if this is connected.

so let's just connect the dots on what I just said here: the atlantians (nosebook) wanted to subdue the world, but then an event happens where the athenians managed to crush the atlantians on the battlefield (science). this was made possible (I believe) mostly because of the efforts of a guy (ramtha) who made his transition in the process.

if the battlefield is science, then it's really easy to do all of this stuff. I thin it's pretty easy to find a way to come up with our own version of nosebook and a whole lot of other things too. I don't see why we couldn't do that. who knows.

---

the other thing is that the atlantians wanted to have the whole world under their control. however, if we find a way to flip the planet over, there won't be much of a cataclysm, but most crushing for them is the realisation that they don't control the rotation/orientation of the planet anymore.

don't get me wrong: nosebook won't cease to exist -- and I think they'll continue to be quite profitable selling their services to people. they'll remain the "bad-guys" that mr. motor wants so badly. I think they're the new drug-dealers of the future -- being a way for people to purchase the way they want to feel (amongst other services).

I have no idea how to get there and I don't really want to try and make any efforts to get there either. if it's going to happen, it'll happen naturally. anyway I don't really see myself as the guy leading the charge or something very masculine like that. I actually see myself more as like a cheerleader in the background. I prefer that role anyway, as I really would prefer that you guys figure it out. I have lots of good ideas and they're all free (they always will be), but the real thing is the implementation. bringing those ideas into reality and getting them sold to people is the hard part. as you know I struggle with sales and implementation, so I feel quite good not having to do either.

---

the other thing is, I just don't really care. I'll save this discussion for another time but I don't need these conditions to feel good. I am finding my way to feel good just fine.

I have found that my entire life has taught me *not* to care. the minute I start to care, things start to fall apart for me. I know this isn't other people's experience and I admire their desire to have things just the way they want them (aka product team), however for me this quicky turns into me needing something or someone else to be different so I can feel good and that's when it starts to fall apart for me.

I have found that when I don't care what others are doing and I just feel a way, then people come to me with ideas that reflect the way I feel. therefore it's best for me to just feel good and then the whole projuct reflects that. I set the tone with my expectation and the cascade of events must follow that.

### 2021-07-06 15:16 - just let me be wrong

I was getting some reactions about the last entry about how some of my ideas may be wrong. I don't care. the minute I get better data, I update. it's not a big deal for me to be wrong. in fact so many of the discoveries that I value came from mistakes or huge blunders. I'm much more the edison than the tesla. I prefer to make mistakes.

there are so many advantages to being able to rapidly update and improve on things. I think that people may think that I'm advocating for a facebook-like performance: move fast and break things. it's not like that. if I assume that nothing I say is 100% right, then each time, I'm just finding a more improved way to translate the idea into reality.

I really like the serpent bros concept of printing your own certificate of ignorance. every time I know a little more, the world opens up a bit bigger and it becomes aparent there's always more to know. I guess a few hundred years ago someone could maybe know more than half of all of the human knowledge-base. today, this is impossible and makes it very aparent that there is always more to learn and new ways to see the same things (aka you were "wrong"). therefore I don't pretend to even try to be right. it's just my best guess.

---

one good thing that may come from m ebeing wrong so much is that perhaps there will be new ways to express uncertainty. when thinking I must assume the thing is right to be able to make any progress on the idea.

take for example the latest veritasium video, the guy there was wrong, but it was really more like our understanding of the concept was incomplete and he was just the guy pushing for a better understanding of the idea. by being wrong, he opened up better explanations of the thing and enabled further expansion of scientific understanding with derek's competition. I'm that guy all the time. I don't mind being wrong because it always illuminates the idea and makes it more visible.

I can only imagine hmow much nosebook has learned trying to piece together what I'm really saying back when I used the previous (more imprecise) keyboard. my writing was a mess. it's not like this is ultra clean, but certainly it has to be a lot better.

---

the last thing I want to mention is that I find it good for me to struggle. if you look at me with physical eyes, you may notice that I'm pretty bad at almost everything physical. learning to type like this is one of the hardest things ever. I never really realised how much I used my alignment to compensate for how bad I am at so many things.

I don't know how to program very well. I just know how to find what I'm looking for and that seems to work. I constantly fail and then find the next way. it's more like trial and error. I don't think that edison really understood electricity. tesla clearly did.

as an example of this, I was watching this one guy play kingdom rush and he has a lot of the hp of the enemies and wave quantities memorised. he clearly knows the game really well. I am the opposite. I have done quite a few challenges and fumbled my way through them not exploiting the mechanics -- just sort of being guided (or perhaps learning through trial and error) the way to be able to do it. I don't *understand* the game nearly as well as he does. this is the same for everything I do.

I don't really get science like other people do. I just have a very good intuition and can sorta follow my desire toward the answer. following that desire is almost always doing things the wrong way -- cause always out of unwanted is just as much (or more) wanted. I exploit that. that's what I understand -- not programming or electricity or science.

---

that capacity is cultivated with emotional sensitivity. I can often times tell when something is off and I can also feel where to begin looking for the solution too. that's why I often say, "I know it's wrong but just go with it because it's gonna lead toward wanted"

if it feels like the right way, it is the right way even if it's "wrong".

### 2021-07-06 22:23 - super conspiracy theories

I think I figured out what people thought I was wrong about -- and it was abraham. in a previous entry I made the statement that I received reactions telling me that nosebool was in a pretty big jam and they wanted me to sorta take over the world shaman role from abraham and that's what zach's memorial was going to be about.

obviously that's a pretty tall claim, as it would require esther to have made her transition and it paints a really dim picture of nosebook trwying to control things. I also stated pretty empatically that I didn't want that responsibility. that's all well and good and I just carried on. sad I suppose but not a big deal.

I then explained last night while watching stars that the loss of abraham is kinda annoying because I have sxo many things I would want to ask them. there is no one with more questions than me. I explained my sadness when I figured out I was being broadcasted because now any responses to any question would be tailored to the audience of the whole world and not just to me specifically. inotherwords, I would get abraham-like (semi-vague) answers to my questions instead of the brutal honesty and truth type conversations I wanted to have with them.

interestingly enough the reaction that I had to that was sorta like "huh?" more than, "wtf are you talking about, abraham isn't gone"

---

fast-forward to today when I wrote that saturday's energy felt very different to me. I took this as evidence that abraham is gone, which is why I made that assumption last night in the monologue. for me, if they were still here, I would have felt the energy on saturday similarly to how I have for the last 5 years or so. clearly something else is different.

instead I felt quite a strong energy the following day on sunday the 4th of july. I have felt strong energy on sundays a few times so I didn't think much of it. also sunday's energy felt more like the energy that I felt on new-years 2020 (1.5 years ago. last year not so much). anyway, I figured sunday's energy was just festive energy.

---

another interesting thing to note is when I woke up this morning I was reminded of the one time that I didn't believe abraham when they told the writer that she should absolutely let the guy be the reason for her alignment. I found it really hard to believe that they would say that. I sorta left the subject because there were weird reactions. since however, I've been paying a lot more attention to what they're saying -- however other than that one, I haven't noticed any glaring flaws. I'm leaving this one open. I just don't know right now.

however it was weird timing because it means someone is thinking about me questioning the validity of abraham's message -- which only makes sense it's a thing.

I debated on whether to write this or not because I don't want to sound like I'm trying to spin some narrative. I suppose it also sounds pretty bad too after I just wrote that I'm just an actor and taking cues at this point.

however, at the same time I also advised about taking me too seriously too. I think that people should give the benefit of belief until there's good reason for it to be wrong. I mean that's why I'm in this to begin with. I just blindly believe the things that pop into my head until they no longer fit; then I discard the idea. I just blindly belived the reaction of esther making her transition and so now here I am. so far the evidence has supported her having made her transition but I'm open to new evidece. it's often the case that I'm wrong about something.

---

so I got the reaction that I was wrong and then I was directed to check my email. there are new abeshares emails saying there are new broadcasts. I guess that's what people think I'm wrong about... fair enough.

we'll see how things develop. I'm still quite a ways from those broadcasts, but even with recent broadcasts I still maintain saturday's energy was very uncharacteristic of a saturday. I'm not fully convinced. I'm still quite a ways from getting to those broadcasts so I'll have to see when I get there. the one I'm most interested in is the 6-19 broadcast though, as that is the one that still isn't available, was put through your "limited time offer" sales crap on exactly the time that I couldn't get to it. I don't fully buy it. call me doubting thomas but I'm not super convinced. I'll have to see what their message is like when I get there...

---

there are a few possible explanations here which could be happening:

1. they are reusing some material of some older sessions which I haven't seen/heard. I haven't heard all of the abe catalogue so they could have rewritten a few workshops I haven't heard to fit the new format and then used CG or an actor to make the image. obviously if I could figure out how to decode the lightshow in the background into an image (an idea I got on new-years 2021) then it would we interesting to see if the new broadcasts have a similar thing.

2. the same way they're using my capability to make alternate versions of me, they could potentially figure out how to make anything of any shape or size -- so an abraham-like "Hew". this would be the best version as it would behave as a reflection of how I perceive the abraham concept. I think I get their message pretty well, so it would be pretty good
  - alternately, it could be just another version of me doing what esther does + some CG to make me look like esther. I know I could do what esther does pretty easily

3. there are numerous conspiracy theories of the govenrnment using "clones". an actor would provide the movement.

---

personally, I think the second is the most likely and it ties in with a number of reactions I had the last few days. ever since I wrote about dividing my energy and essentially becoming an actor, taking thought and feeling cues to steer the scene, I started to really begin to think about how I *will* have a multi-bodied experience but instead of as versions I create, I would be in these actors -- or in the original concept, I called them "automatons of contrast".

you can be assured that these actors are there to take cues and steer the situation in the way they want it to go. right now I don't experience the perspective of these Hews just like I don't experience the perspective of the other versions of me, but when I make my transition, I will. especially if I do it like ramtha did by converting unwanted into wanted -- then I will accomplish this conceptual perspective I was talking about where I am the sum total of the beings, just like "you" are the sum total of all of your cells. when they all die (no longer resonant with your consciousnes), "you" are dead and no longer perceive through that body.

so if that's the case, then abraham would be my concept of them, plus nosebook's edits -- perhaps similar to the weird event where they told the writer she should use the guy -- presumably me (which is probably just another actor pretending to be me) as the reason for her alignment.

I guess as I'm writcing this I have also noticed other weird things like they seem to appear a bit pissed off almost at some of the questions -- like someone wrote asking if esther got the vaccine and they said she already had it, but I detected annoyance.

let's assume that is the case, that means the Hew would behave like my concept of abraham would for the entire show -- unless someone made an edit, getting them to specifically address a certain question -- like the vaccine one and that one would contain the emotional energy of the person making that edit.

that was an event prior to 6-19 though so I dunno. I'm just going to keep seeing how things develop.

other than the edits, their information should be pretty good -- a mix of my concept of them (I'd say likely pretty pure) and whatever emotional energy of the actor/operators combined. it still would be source, but translated with a coloured lens and some filters. so kinda like the bible or something: good information but with the important concepts obfuscated.

it's important to feel as good as possible to get the best recption so if the actor/operator isn't on their best feeling, there may be some distortion in the translation of the concepts. whatever the resistance level doesn't matter as source will still wedge their message in the crack (between the edits).

things to look out for will be:
- giving power to things outside of you (anti self-empowerment).
- direct guidance instead of illustration of the cocept (tell you what to do, not how it works).
- trajectory toward conditions and manifestations instead of accomplishing the understanding of the concept.
- blindly following anything without understanding how it works.

stuff like that...

you know after writing this, it definitely feels like something is definitely up. if it is, this is a really good thing. you all begin to have a similar experience to what I have. it's so extra much energy and you'll soon be so good at knowing what you feel, and how it anything more than an indicator (though it can feel pretty real) of your perception of whatever it is. they can't manipulate that.

assuming this is happening, I'm actually very happy because they really have to micromanage a lot cause faking abraham would be a pretty big secret they're definitely going to need to work real hard to ensure no one finds out the truth. lol, imagine how much they're going to have to study their message to have a believable script each week. this may get a little hilarious. who knows...

### 2021-07-07 14:09 - world wide abraham foundation

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ij3gRC5vJE)

for this entry I am assuming the previous entry to have validity.

if nosebook is running the wwaf, then it creates an interesting feedback loop. they can get real-time feedback to the message from people's reactions to it.

it also has the interesting feature that it reminds me a lot of WWF when I was a kid. it was pretty common knowledge that it was all an act -- but it was still entertaining so people still watched it (even the ones that knew it was fake).

it kinda gives them a bit of an out too. I was reminded of the undercover kylo SNL where he "reveals" to everyone that he's kylo but everyone already knew. today, if WWF were to make a public statement saying that it was all an act, I don't even know if major news outlets would give it more than a passing remark. it's longest segment would appear as a joke on SNL's weekend update -- nothing more.

---

I really don't see it as a bad thing. I was trying to figure out what the reaction was in the 6-19 episode was that they would want to keep hidden. my present theory is that something very uncharacteristic of abraham was said and a bunch of people noticed it. dunno.

personally I like this version of abraham a lot better because it actually inspires even more thought and analysis into what they're saying. I think it's a good thing.

### 2021-07-09 01:06 - reactions and stuff

last-night/yesterday had a pretty weird turn of events happen in it. I had a number of reactions to things that I didn't feel like previously I would have gotten reactions to. the first was a comment I made on a tony heller video saying that I felt it was a bit unfair to call it the biden administration when he's clearly not running the show. I thought about it later and thought that it may be similar to saying something like bart simpson's political agenda: bart isn't real he says what the writers put in his mouth.

the next reaction I had was to a comment I made about chris farley likely having coke having something to do with his death. I said that along with a number of other rather offensive things that day and didn't really get much of a reaction to those things. that was before zach's memorial though.

along with other reactions, the sense I get is that before nosebook was manipulating my image so that people percceived even the offensive things as being not so bad or something. however, I don't believe they are going out of their way to smoothe things over anymore now. the other thing is that is if the perception has started to stick that it's never going to happen, the "forgiveness" could be less -- as in people were willing to let things slide or put up with some of my offensive qualities as long as they're getting something in return.

this tends to suggest to me that nosebook promised people something they never intended to follow through on. what I think it could be is that nosebook claimed that somehow me having sex was going to reward the world with my visual capabilities. obviously nosebook does not want people to have my visual capabilities. I believe they're selling it, making that their cash cow. there's no way they would give that away for free. that was likely just a ruse to try and get me captured into the influence of a bunch of girls they believed they could influence easily to steer me away from things like science and tech.

this would explain why (from my perspective), it appeared like they were constantly setting up these events only to (at the same time) be actively working to sabotage them. this is your basic "occupy wall-street" formula. they satiate the people then sabotage the events until the furvour dies out.

---

those were the reactions that I was having yesterday but there. I wrote the esther / abraham being a sort of actor as the lite version because I have noticed that they seem to have figured out how to give people these queues as well. what I don't know is how many of the people I interact with are actors.

the reason why I say this is because if I were nosebook, from my perspective, it would be way too big of a risk for me to have ordinary people around me. if I were them, I would be doing everything I would to get everything around me under control and monetised. the people, the places I go to (harbor, etc.) all of it needs to have product placement and all of the people under control. as an example, the new girl said something about a cold beverage and a stinging in her throat. I wasn't paying attention to what she was saying and thought she was talking about vodka. she was talking about coca-cola. later matthew wanted to be sure I had I coca-cola before I left.

so I have the product placement, the directed conversations, etc. they feel the same as the product placement here at home and the contrived conversations I have with mom and everything. I used to fight it, but now I just take the cues and follow along: notice how I responded to the coca-cola offering by saying it's "refreshing"? notice how much better I'm getting at this acting thing.. hehe pretty impressive how fast of a learner I am, huh?

this *must* mean that I am living in a fully constructed reality with everyone around me conforming to the script.

---

I don't really mind that it's that way because I can finally begin to relax. I basically have no control so I just do as I feel now. I also feel much less weight about having to worry about the whole girls thing too. what this means is that they are absolutely certain that they don't want any girls things happening. I mentioned that the prostate/uterus can emit a feeling. if a girl gets around me and is too attractive, that feeling will begin to attract a reality they don't have control of. therefore, my current theory of what they have to do if anyone poses a threat to their control over my situation must be separated from this reality.

I imagine that they would be placed in an anternate reality designed to have a manifestation with an actor pretending to be me. I honestly doubt it would be another version of me because that poses a similar risk to this one if I get connected there either. then, the attractive person here they had to netralise would also have to be replaced with an actor too. I find it most likely those actors are just other versions of me taking the shape of the target -- similar to what I think happened to esther.

I can't really confirm this at all as it feels like all these weird things are happening. it could have a much more simple explanation to it. however, at this point, especially with the shift in reactions and also with the cues, it's pretty obvious that something is *definitely* up -- though I'm not sure exactly what yet.

---

extrapolating this idea out a bit, there are some interesting "consequences" to this:

1. if everyone with a strong reaction to me (cause I'm using both unwanted and wanted reactions to continue expanding) has to be neutralised, that means there are infinitely many timelines that I find my way (even with the actor) and all of these will be watching me here on this one. so eventually it will only be me, mr. motor and all of the other versions of me that mr. motor is using as actors. given enough time, it'll just be me and him here remaining. eventually I'll get it though and he'll have a whole planet of actors he can control. I liken this to the scene in the matrix when agent smith begins to take over everyone in the vicinity of neo wherever he goes.

2a. there are not infinite nosebook actors so the worst will go first but over time less and less resistant actors will be available until there are finally no more humans on this planet capable of becoming an actor so he'll have to resort to separating out these attractive people with just alternate versions of myself.

2b. each time that someone transfers their consciousness into one of the actors and becomes too attractive of me and is therefore a threat must be separated out (gets the manifestation). each time it'll be better and eventually really good.

3. given enough time I will either find my connection or an unavoidable attraction with a girl will happen. he'll have to bail out eventually right before that happens. in that sense, there will be a "winner" 

finally, let's put the speculation goggles on: I *really* don't know any of this for sure, but I imagine that at the end mr. motor will have a whole world full of actors and also of various boys -- the product of the actors and the girls manifestations. my current understanding of it is that all babies made will be boys (x3s) and so unless something is done, these boys when mating with the actors will just produce more x3 boys. I believe x4 girls will need to be artificially created. I suspect that the easilst way will be to hybridise 48 chromosome apes. until this is done, there will be a very definite male population advantage, essentially making the whole world population be x3 boys. I think this is exazctly the opposite of what hapened to the ancient atlantian gods (but they only produced daughters) and that was the real reason why enlil wanted enki to create a hybrid race which could produce male offspring (unfortunately this reduced their psychic abilities).

it feels to me like circcumstances similar to this could be the conditions necessary to create the desire necessary to pull someone like me through here again. seems I show up as a product of desire. they need to get theirselves into another pretty big jam that they need another tech upgrade to keep their charade going. talk about a co-dependent dysfunctional relationship where I can solve the problems they refuse to find their alignment to solve on their own. or perhaps the better way to look at it is he's the fail-safe allowing me to get right up to the orgasm, but then pull out at the very last moment.

something like that...

### 2021-07-09 18:18 - a few ways to look at it

when I woke up this afternoon I noticed there were a fair number of reactions to the previous entry. alot of them were considering the sort ways that it would play out. to be honest, I hadn't really considered the idea much at all until yesterday but I'd like to run through some of the scenarios.

most of the rest of the reactions were considering how I am possibly aware of the acting even if I never think about it. I think nosebook even tries to prevent me from thinking thoughts about it, so it's not really a surprise that I don't think about it. it's also pretty important that you are not this body. this body is just an automaton of "who you really are" -- and I mean that literally: "you" are not the body or the brain. our body is usually the closest algnment to ourselves, so we often mistake it for our identity. it's also more vivid than that conceptual form. I suppose I would be more present in my body here if I had stronger sensation here. nosebook can't allow that so it's easy to see why I'm beginning to slowly make my transition back into non-physical perception. obviously I have a long way to go before that happens.

I think the sensational experience is actually designed to increase in vividness the more energy that someone allows, if the vividness didn't increase, nothing would hold you to the physical and you would make your transition (like enoch, moses, ramtha, etc.) into non-physical perception. it's also nice because as the whole world feels better, the whole experience reflects that and looks better too. it's quite nice.

---

following that mention of the sensational experience, the quote of there being two paths: one of lots of affection and the other of none. he choose the latter. the concept of lots of affection being a huge amount of sensation meaning that a lot of sensation is a lot of energy and therefore if it's a lot of energy then you can allow your transition into non-physical. therefore, I would change tesla's quote from affection to sensation.

changing the word from affection to sensation allows us to understand jesus' experience a whole lot easier too pain is sensation and even in large amounts of pain it *is* just more energy and with strong focus, it is still possible to find one's alignment.

ok so let's get into the situations here there are a few basic roles to look at:

first there is a condition (such as a celestial alignment or a strong projector of feeling) which affects the way I feel physically. this physical manifestation of the way I feel (sensation) is one of the paths toward my connection.

next, that condition must be neutralised. a combination of techniques are used I'm sure, but in the case that it's another person, the previous entries propose that these people are placed on their own timeline and thme version here is replaced by one of my Hews -- an actor influenced by mr. motor. the other timeline also gets another Hew as well which appears like me and is also likely influenced easily (they're both low resistance so now so like me they just follow the cues without much/any resistance). I find it likely that this alternate kenny has an operator.

for simplicity I'll say there is a "girl" (the threat) which gets moved to another timeline and replaced by an "actor" on this one. kenny on the other timeline is also a Hew but with an "operator". the operators likely are mostly people who volunteer to play as me, but I can imagine that at some point there will no longer be enough vetted operators and other normal humans will need to be used, as I'm sure they'll be more resistant than a vanilla alternate me. so normal humans will likely need to be used as operators.

on the alternate timelines, each of the operators will be taking the path of lots of affection and the operator will eventually find their alignment in my body and that experience. when they find their alignment, they'll gain the ability to perceive other timeline versions of theirselves and be able to choose to move their consciousness into another version of theirself and "fall" into that experience of strong sensation (pain, sex, etc).

there are a number of ways that can play out but at the very minimum everyone who gains that perspective has the ability to tune into their "actor" here on this timeline and can again try to figure out how to get the manifestation they want. I'll consider that to be the "hardest" or likely their most out of alignment version of theirself with the strongest sensation.

from a non-physical perspective (who you really are) there isn't a whole lot of sensation as things don't really "touch" there so basically *anything* is stronger sensation than that and someone desiring a manifestation will be drawn to sensation again. I contend that the only way to maintain one's non-physical perspective is to not need the manifestation. as long as someone wants the manifestation -- or, the sensation of the manifestation, they will constantly be attracted to whatever version of theirself has the strongest sensation.

this is why I'm shooting for the "worst" manifestation. if I can feel good (in alignment with my source) even in the worst manifestation, then I no longer "need the manifestation" to feel good (find my alignment).

the process of finding their alignment with sensation/affection will likely continue on for quite some time and each time they'll get better at finding their alignment too. for people who really like the manifestation, this is pretty awesome because they can just keep going from manifestation to manifestation. it's kind of the opposite of how we perceive normal relationships now. now you find someone then it declines into oblivion. this time you find the manifestation and it gets better and better. then, at the peak the beat drops and it starts all over again.


### 2021-07-10 14:32 - sensation and learning

after writing yesterday's entry, it felt to me like the concept of reincarnation finally started to make sense. I also finally realised (and it seems a bit obvious now on hindsight) that one of the major defining attributes of me is that I can walk away really easy from a manifestation. I don't really have such a strong desire for sensation.

I didn't really understand this until (as usual) derek posted another video exactly on the topic that would help me to see this.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhgwIhB58PA)

in the video he is talking about how no one is any particular learning style. I learn best (like he postulates) when I experience the same concept from many different angles: with words, a picture, and a feeling.

I used to be able to feel what other people are saying directly, but this is telepathy and nosebook does not want me able to tune into others' experiences so most of that is shut down. people's words do not usually make an image appear in my mind -- and when it does, the image is so abstract that I doubt it has image-like qualities, feeling instead more like what a child experiences the world like before they gain language.

I then realised that because people's ideas do not make it into my head, I have to produce them. I often times interrupt people or stop listening so that I can begin to actually feel what they last said and begin to construct a concept of what they're saying.

what this means is that I have noticed that there are two main mediums for people to learn: vark/imagination and feeling/conceptual. obviously vark is producing a concept and a concept/feeling/emotion is producing vark. this is how my imagination works: strong feelings produce images, sound, and tactile sensations (dunno what the R is).

---

strangely enough I had a situation which produced this exact effect in me. yesterday I was reading the code of zig. I do this often to start to get a "feel" of the code. the better I feel like I know the code, the more effective I am at navigating it and comprehending it as a whole. I also "feel" the author as there is quite considerable mental energy that I can tune into when I read it[^1].

as I was looking at the code, I just couldn't hook into the feeling of how it works. the whole code and the concept hme transmits in the video all feel really good to me and I feel the desire to understand it, but I'm really struggling with some simple things that are really obvious, I'm sure.

this felt exactly like when I was a kid and I wanted to learn C++. I could copy/paste and move around other people's code but I couldn't figure out what there was sometimes a void in front of main and sometimes an int. I understood the return value type from a functions because I wrote functions to do small tasks, but not understanding what the the sometimes int return value on main really held me back from getting the whole picture. I then moved to assembly (SpAsm) and it started to make sense there. I just wrote 'ret' in the main function and it didn't matter what was in eax (I was writing windows gui programs not console programs). it never occured to me until much later when writing console programs for node what the return value actually meant.

either way, I never felt like I really understood C++ and to this day struggle with it. it's really important that I *feel* like I know what I'm doing.

I remember that some time later on in my life I had a brain haemorrhage and when that happened my feeling capability started to flow and I felt like I could understand the programs and I started to be able to program really effectively. prior to this I was very imaginary and visual but that was precisely what was preventing me from learning to program. there's nothing visual about programming for me. it's all these idea components which fit together in my mind and construct a mental "picture" of what is happening -- cept it's not a picture at all. it's a feeling.

---

related to this, there's another thing I noticed when I watched a mulaney interview and that he is very detail oriented. I used to be very much like that enumerating the events and their details to respond to an emotional question like "how was your night" or "how does this feel". the details mattered as a slight change in the detail could really change the feeling of the whole concept. I had to traverse the sequence of data points to get to the feeling.

I was this way when I was a good programmer. when programming was difficult to wrap my head around, I was more like how I am now where I'm so abstract that I understand the concept, but I really have no idea of the implementation details.

the way this all fits together, is previously I had to enumerate the data points (manifestation) to get the feeling, and now the data points (words, etc) distract me from the feeling. what I'm saying is, for me now the implementation doesn't matter. the feeling of it is good enough. I don't need to understand the manifestation to get the feeling. in that way, I wish I hadn't tried to look at the zig code because I like the way it feels even though the present manifestation of that feeling in code doesn't at all match (the zig idea feels really good but the code feels incomprehensible to me).

I think if I were to have another brain haemorrhage again it would cause me to refocus a lot on the details again because I would have to observe the exact movements of my body and its interaction with the world instead of how I feel in my world. this refocus would slow me down a lot and likely permit me to return to programming again as I would be more sensation focused again.

programming really is like the furthest out one can go in phsical expression before things start to get so abstract they're no longer physically identifyable. I really desire for some changes to the way that code is expressed similar to the ones I desire for changes in our language as well.

quick tangent: I was thinking about how to integrate zig into serenity and it does all of the low level stuff really well, but it needs a more abstract layer on top of it which can express the concept of object heierarchy that serenity uses. a fairly large portion of serenity's code is just boilerplate to show the relationships between these objects. in zig's present state of a very low-level language it has all of the capability of expressing these objects and their relationships (structs, etc) but the boilerplate to do so would be even greater than C++. there needs to be a way of expressing these relationships in a way which produces all the boilerplate automatically allowing the programmer to just express the relationship and not get bogged down with the boilerplate. most of the rest of the logic would remain the same needing very little change as zig is essentially a C compliler already.

I have no way at all to know how to implement something like this. I would also want the relationships and the navigation of this "code" to have an interface allowing for easy search and traversal of the objects. I dunno.. I'll keep thinking on it.

sorry for the rambly entry today.. I think some of these concepts will form the basis for future discussions.

[1]: this may have something to do with what happens when other people touch your code. it disrupts the mental energy of the code, often times trying to take the "feel" of that code in an entirely different direction. improvements don't seem to change the mental energy much. instead, it's the "this needs needs to be different" vibe I think that is so disruptive.


### 2021-07-11 06:12 - sick plot twist

these are the subjects for a future discussion I wanted to write but after star-watching, I want to write something different: 
- the daughters of men 
- guy in book of enoch which built weapons and makeup 
- enmendurana 7th pre-deluvian king 
- why do I tkink the earth fliped over? 
- crop circles

---

in a previous entry I surmised that I believe that the new x3 models will only produce an x3 male as offspring. I don't really know all of the genetics and stuff about why that may be so, but from a marketing perspective, this is a sort of job security. I think the way that I appear here on earth is they get themselves into such a big jam that their survival is threatened and so someone like me shows up to bail them out.

imagine the situation where it was the case that the planet *did* go up a power level and so therefore the humans did become superhumans. this would be certain disaster for mr. motor types, as under that higher energy all of their fear and bad-feeling would manifest into their reality pretty rapidly. they would either die or no longer function in a way which they could continue to propagate their genes. there would no longer be a suitable body for them to inhabit. inotherwords, they would go extinct.

desire is desire though and if you have enough of it, it will produce a manifestation of what you want. I believe that I am the manifestation of their desire. they got theirselves into a pretty big jam and need a way out. we know that strong enough desire does produce a manifestation, but it's the alignment with that desire will determine how smoothe the manifestation goes. therefore, they are going to find a way to get what they want, just it'll feel pretty similar to the frequency they're at.

I mentioned that I think in the past that I thought that the corrupt atlantian "gods" had a problem where they were only producing daughters. I have no way of knowing what the situation was but something terrible happened on mars (almost certainly attracted), but it seems they were either infertile or did not have enough variety in their genome -- but, for whatever reason, reproduction stopped and the martian gods no longer were dying out.

I think they came to earth and tried to mix with the early human hominids, but their genetics must have rejected the y-chromosome and it seems to me that they were only producing daughters. I think it was then that the decision was made to create "man" -- the hybrid species that was capable of mating with the "gods" and producing male offspring. as the story goes, enlil wants them to be weak, subserviant, and have their mental capacities locked. I think the intention was that the way to unlock these mental capacities was supposed to be kept a secret and only the patriarchs would know how to access them. this must be the initiation with the pinecone depicted. either way, "man" was less mentally capable than the gods (by design) so it's no wonder that the offspring of these atlantian gods was also crippled in their capacities.

I imagine that the original laws/rules for the atlantian kings were given so they would retain a pure bloodline. I think the bloodline thing is probably a thing that started back on mars and may have been the reason for their sterility, but that's beside the point. either way, they began to lose their mental capacities going down.

imagine that you're one of these atlantian gods that does not want to ever give attention to wanted or to ever go extinct, he would have the ability to transfer his consciousness into a suitable body when he dies -- and assume that not always is he transferring his consciousness into one of his own kids' bodies -- still, over time, the quality of the body is going down. I don't know if it would even be possible to traladar into a baby because they're too high frequency. instead, a only a similarly resistant man could be selected. you could see how over time the quality would go down as things get worse and worse.

he would continue to need a fresh new genetic code to inhabit that is capable of holding him. it needs to be resistant enough to receive his consciousness and also sweet enough to cancel out most of the resistant vibrations. my genetic code is perfect for that I have figured out how to transform nearly all resistant vibration received into neutral or good-feeling.

as I mentioned, DNA (I believe) is an emotional state machine so my genetics would have a very strong propensity to find a way to feel good already without having to do any mental exercise. my DNA is perfect for him to transfer into.

assume for a moment that he has/will do that -- so consider that mr. motor inhabits an x3 now. so, when I bring up the idea that an x3 mating with an x2 will always produce an x3 and never an x4, it doesn't take much time to realise that the x3 is kind of like a virus. there will be more and more boys that are producing more boys. the x2 girls will become only a select few (say 1% of the population) which will control and breed x1 boys to maintain their existance.

obviusly this has the same problem of a reduced gene pool. eventually the girls will face the same problem of extinction if they can't broaden their x1 gene pool or find a way to make some x4 girls. I have no way of knowing what things will be like in the future so I can't speculate there too much to know if the x2 girls in power would willingly produce a superior model to their own allowing their subordinates (the x3 boys) to easily produce superior women to theirselves (x4s) -- but obviously at some point it will have to happen to prevent both of their extinctions.

interesting intro there, so here's the plot twist: I will eventually make my transition as well, which means I will too be inhabiting the x3 bodies. what if the whole point of this from the x3 perspective is to again not need the manifestation.

I don't really know how to describe this feeling/reaction actually but it seems that there is a lot of fear around that. you could see it's manifestation in the matriarchy's desire not to have superior women around to rival their position of power. they would, like nosebook, try to ensure that no manifestation ever happens. this may mean that the next anouncer of the era will be an x2 female that is prevented from having the manifestation so long that she (like me) actually learns how to fill in her disabled half, effectively doubling herself, making herself an x4

developing...

another thing I was thinking about last night is that I really don't want to do the list anymore. I just don't care and it feels like a lot of effort. I think that it may have something to do with some influences and its implications will likely be the subject of the next entry. I cannot describe how apathetic I am on this now. I just don't care.

it's quite possible that the not caring is actually the precursor to actually getting connected though. it would mean that mr. motor would likely need to go semewhere other than the earth for fear of his feeling manifesting into reality with the higher energy. however I could imagine that mr. motor wouldn't allow that and may want to go his own way glad that I won't be transitioning into his x3 models. if that's the case, then I doubt he will want to do that anytime soon so probably we're going to continue to not need the manifestation a bit more.

I'm sorta all or nothing on this and there is one advantage to this: if there are many versions of me which are x3 which are generated by me and have my energy in them, then that's probably where I'll make my transition into. obviously, we'll also make x4 models too which was the original plan. I don't know (actually doubt) that mr. motor may want some of those. I actually doubt it because they would be pretty intuitive. I think he would more likely make his transition into a computer before ever depending on a woman for his survival. it's easier to control a computer

### 2021-07-12 05:37 - we're the bad guys

as I've been exploring further and further what I wrote in the last entry, a number of things has started to become clear. I proposed that mr. motor was using my capability to create "Hews" as a method of controlling many aspects at the same time. I'm not quite sure where his consciousness begins and ends but the part about him inhabiting my genetics is pretty certain to me at this time.

I've begun to realise that when I finally make my transition (probably in 2038 I guess) then I will become all of mr. motor's actors/automatons that he is placing around doing stuff. he'll continue to make more of them to do his dirty work and stuff and they are technically "me". they're low-resistance versions of me that are capable of doing anything really, because it's all just more energy.

I have often wondered why my future self called himself "former white hat" -- but now I realise that he is the "bad-guys" and he's just making the setup of this timeline from that point of view. you may be able to understand if I say that fwh is "me" (from my perspective) but from the human/physical perspective, he's "the landscape artchitect" of the previous timeline.

---

what this looks like, would be something like -- mr. motor is creating all sorts of actors and putting them in all sorts of positions that allows him to retain physical control. these are the x3s that always produce x3 offspring. they'll eventually be regarded as a sort of virus and they'll infect all aspects of society.

they're all me, but they're created, controlled, and directed in the physical by mr. motor. mr. motor is also me from my perspective too, but think of him as a sort of rogue part of me. I see things from his perspective and know everything about him. it's my job to just observe and find a way to feel good about everything that's happening just like source does. in that sense you may think of me as a sort of localised source for all of the actors and all of their x3 progeny (the virus).

---

it's kind of interesting for me to think about what will happen on this one because there will be A LOT of dudes in short order and only a few females. almost certainly mr. motor will try to ensure they never gain too much control, attempting to block all of their attempts to gain any technological capability. I really can't imagine what that will result in as far as a power structure because of the following (in no particular order):

- mr. motor will need to keep the women from gaining any technical capability, so they don't rival his control of time and physical conditions.
- however, each time that passes there will be less and less x1 and x2 population to continue to create more girls
- the women will need to guard against too many girls procreating with x3s because they exacerbate the problem. they'll need to create more x2s to continue on surviving.
  - do x2s need x1s to create more x2s?
    - it seems like if there are x2 actors, then mr. motor could create more x2s when he needs
  - I dunno... that kinda changes things... lemme think...

wow, that would be the ultimate power-trip for mr. motor if that's the case. there will be an ever-growing population of x3s, and if any of them want to interact with a female, it's a domain that mr. motor has full control. I guess *all* men are going to find a way to no longer need the manifestation then...

well dang, that sucks for some people then...

I dunno what to think about this really. I'm sorta fine with becoming the bad-guy because I can find a way to feel good about anything. I'm also OK with pushing out the not needing the manifestation thing for quite some time too. I would say it's also weird to think that with this setup I'm basically going to gain the perception of everyone in the planet (or something like that).

kinda weird. I have a lot to think about.
