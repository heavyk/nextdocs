### 2021-06-18 13:45 - starting over

I decided to completely reset and start over. I shaved my head and am starting a new keyboard layout as well. it is going slow, hehe.

so many things are different and this layout isn't final at all. I'm just trying it out to see how to improve on it before using his code to make my own. I noticed that I have different finger costs than he does. I also really like the 's' on the left side, but I do like the 3 finger space in the middle. the location of the 'v' and the 'p' are super annoying though. oh yeah I hate the 'k' loc as well.

other than the kbd, I have noticed a lot of changes in how much I feel now too. earlier I had a conversation with mom about hair and it wasn't until later on that I noticed the reactions to it. I still get the reactions but they are so faint now that I'm kinda like your average dude now that it largely unaware of the reactions. it's nice be masculine again. I can just fumble around while everyone else cringes. I intend to do just that. I was thinking that there is desire for a new trump -- the ex-president.

imagine that we're all cruising along and you guys all have your manifestations (the automatons) and I remain largely how I am. you guys have the data and I continue on with my theories and ideas, of some of them are still wrong. I do like I do now where I keep updating my ideas with the feedback I get from my sixth-sense.

that means you guys get to hold the high ground with all your data and stuff and I get to be repeatedly wrong as I pontificate my way toward the better and better way of perceiving it. I don't mind being repeatedly wrong, way off-base and cringe.


### 2021-06-18 17:19 - the way I see it happening

when I think of how something divides or reproduces, there seems to have a moment when the environment is no longer suitable for the emerging entity -- like a birth or a cell division.

next, I have noticed how influential mr. motor's attraction on my situation is -- like, I think he was giving his attention to how annoying it is to babysit me, and then now without a computer to occupy me, he has a whole lot more babysitting to do. or my hair -- I remember him trying to get me to cut it numerous times in dreams -- or back when he believed that force-ejaculating me was reducing energy until I started to get vision upgrades from it.

---

I don't imagine that nosebook can allow me to gain temporal awareness because they have stuff to hide, however like I said, it's not all that bad: I won't have any sex but I will be able to fly around and create objects with my mind -- including human bodies science would probably consider dead. they will become animated though -- and they will (like a child) become a reflection of the person they are interacting with. I can imagine all sorts of uses for these guys and girls. however, I won't have control or even much influence over them -- you'll get what you attract from them.

the creation process for these guys can be automated, but at the beginning I will simply feel the person and then turn that feeling into one of desire until it becomes reality. neither of us will know what will show up; I can only feel it coming. after they see it, they will react and I can again turn the feeling into desire and repeat. for most people, this will be purely visual, so I am sure some effort will be made to perform this process in the privacy of one's own imagination.

so while all of this is happening, you can imagine how much anticipation I have to create technology to words and ideas into a computer faster and easier. sure, I won't have access to my imagination or properly see through my own eyes but I can create technology to greatly enhance my experience.

I may be wrong a lot in the beginning, but as fast as I can think up experiments and run them, I will catch up rapidly. because all of my "imagination" will happen is 3d space, everything will be visible and seen in low quality 3d. I have lots of ideas on how to improve our relation with machines without any utilisation of the imagination.

I even think it's possible to redesign humans too, as I really want explore a lot of ideas I have at running hominid species at microprocessor speeds -- amongst further explorations into more hairless models and other improvements people come up with their fancies.

---

while all of this is happening I believe the planet will rotate faster and have a stronger magnetic field. mr. motor will continue to fight me gaining temporal perception, but ultimately he'll attract the very thing he's fighting against and something will happen where I/we go our separate ways -- or, be born into a new reality. the baby cannot go back into the mother's womb. after the water breaks, it is an incompatible environment for the baby.

the magnetic field strength and reversals is very likely related to rotation speed and just before the separation is a peak like [this](https://www.planetanalog.com/wp-content/uploads/content-images-planetanalog-Image-7-1503855184.png).

I wonder if harmonics to make that square wave must be other stars' orbital resonances in the local cluster and if this is the same mechanism causing cells to divide. I suspect it is.

### 2021-06-22 11:50 - learning the atreus

the white layout really opened my mind with having more keys to press so the atreus is a little bit different in that it has less keys and forces me to type more properly with both hands on the keyboard. I feel like it is a step in the right direction though. I really mostly just need practise.

the wierdest thing about the atreus is that there isn't any buttons next to my pinky fingers. I also keep noticing that I want to press the corresponding key with my opposite hand as if my muscle memory wore mirrored or something. very strange.

### 2021-06-24 02:49 - some thinking on resistance

I was having a monologue on how time worked again and I thought to type it instead because I want the practise. I got to the part where I talked about where reality reflects what we feel and believe and that dreams are the best example of this.

in a dream, if I try to resist the reality, then it gets worse. however, if I just allow what I want to experience, then it just shows up. it doesn't matter how much resistance there is to that all around, it will still appear. it would be like the plastic insulator trying to block the current in the copper -- what I mean is this: if this reality is nothing more than an elaborate dream that we all believe/feel is/as real -- so like atoms are manifesting and stuff... then the one with the least resistance is always more effective at manifesting reality than everyone else is.

the other day I was talking with mom about lowering resistance is short of like lowering one's sail. I like the analogy still quite a lot if one perceives the wind as other people's beliefs -- they're not influencing me very much anymore. that doesn't mean I can do anything I want to just yet either -- I still need to have my own resistance/beliefs to propel me forward though.

more soon...

### 2021-06-24 14:02 - mastering space and time

I figure that there are two major categories in which almost all emotional discomfort falls into:

1. things or people (conditions) which I need to be different so that I can feel the way I want to (temporal discomfort)
2. caring too much about what others think about me or the manifestation (spatial discomfort)

these can be overcome quite easily with practise, and real

[jaron interrupted me so I never finished this idea]

### 2021-06-24 22:44 - what do I want to create?

mom asked me about this the other day and also I had a weird interaction when I had a weird dream this afternoon -- the basic idea is that they have to allow me to "get connected" -- which sounds like hogwash to me. there's no wat they're just going to "let it happen" after all of this time of fighting against it.

the thing that has been on my mind a lot is actually this keyboard. I have never had good muscle memory or to perform any movement rhythmically with any precision. this keybosard has an arduino inside of it and can be reprogrammed to produce entire sequences[^1]. in fact, the coolest thing about it is that when I think of a new thing I can reprogram the keyboard right when I think about it.

I can quickly see how with a little bit of practise, I can get up to typing fast again and even begin to start to automate entire tasks on the computer. my progress is very rapid.

the thing is I just don't want to do the girls thing at all. I don't have any desire to do anything like that and I really want to just continue on the way I am going. I know that eventually I will find a way to manifest the way I feel in reality with ease too, so there is nothing to worry about at all. I will eventually get there.

there's another cool thing about this is that the program uses layers -- yet I would have set it up as sequences. I can see the advantages to both so after I get a little faster I want to work on my own version of it which kind of mixes both ideas.

even for things like custom macros and configurations for pro DOTA players is an option. ever since I had that arguement with greg about elon's mars journey where I made the realisation that there is an upper echalon that doesn't want to allow any tesla technology or anyone to use the physical simulation capability of the imagination -- that has made me really want to find a way to completely bypass the imagination entirely. I know there is a whole set of technologies that are possible using "random" and the temperance of one's emotions.

it may sound weird to say this but it is the precursor to the mastery of time and space in a sort of ironic way: when I need something to be a certain way so that I can feel the way I want to, that is dissatisfaction with my present position in time. that dissatisfaction prevents me from actually moving to the point in time where those conditions are how I want them to be. if I can feel how I want to, then I can manifest what I feel in 3d space.

in the eazrly stages of this manifesting things emotionally, I want to find ways to control computers with sequences. this keyboard allowed me to sort of flip the idea around and allow me to begin to work on the sequences by making them on the keyboard with muscle-memory and then when I have an adequate way to input code into the computer, I can begin to actually write code to detect the signals on the camera and stuff with ease.

one of the biggest hurdles for me writing code is the input of code. I have found keyboards and editors to be largely difficult to use. I just don't think like a keyboard does. keyboards require precision and I am not very precise. we meet in the middle with sequences because if I make a mistake, I can just loop around and go again. also, my mistakes often times inspire me to try out new things.

---

I think we're going to continue on learning to "not need things to be a certain way so that I can feel good" while we gain power over time and space.

I have much more to say about this, however this is good for now.

[1]: the firmware has support for sequences but there is no easy interface to make new ones. so like it's already supported in the firmware but there is no way to use it without writing c++ code.

### 2021-06-25 13:34 - doing things mr. motor's way

a long time ago I used to try and fight mr. motor and try to do things the way I want them to be done, however that falls right into the catergory of "needing things to be a certain way so that I can feel good."

I also had a dream last night where they told me that tesla's vision wasn't even that good (compared to who's?) and that he had gave technology capable of going back and reordering events in time -- which is all well and good, but I'm not talking about changing thme past -- but instead changing how you *feel* about the past so you can create what you want now.

I just think that is a much more effective way of going toward wanted.

I mentioned that I believe that the computer coffee incident had some tampering in it, however it *was* attraacted so therefore it is in the direction of wanted -- I just have to figure out how to perceive it. I'm sorta surprised it took me that long to figure it out but the key was the "not needing things to be different so that I can feel good" bit.

---

as such I have determined that likely the way I will be going is the way mr. motor wants me to do. I think what he does is tell everyone what he thinks they want to hear (so like getting your guys hopes up about things) and then actively workinyg to sabotage it. I have found that mr. motor can only tell me what he doesn't want me to do -- never what *to* do. that means I get to make up what I do do.

so, imagine for a moment (as an example) that he told me not to use my computer -- and so instead I find myself on this one instead learning a new keyboard. it's not a big deal if every time he wants me to do something different, I find something different to do.

if I feel dissatisfaction then I move toward more dissatisfying things. so, like imagine for a moment that I had the ability to go back and modify the past. I would only be doing it because I am dissatisfied with it, and so therefore even though I modified the past to get rid of something unwanted I am still attracting more things that will increase my dissatisfaction and ultimately need to go back and be fixed because they are dissatisfying to me.

therefore it dsoesn't matter what mr. motor doesn't want me to do -- even if he is changing the conditions, I am still moving in the direction of the way I feel, not the present conditions.

a few entries ago I supposed that the peak before the reversal could come from orbital  harmonics, but it's likely temporal -- hence the reason for this decision.

### 2021-06-26 11:25 - becoming the bard-guy

up until the last effort with amoriona, I was perceived as the victim, however since I have been the one actively blocking "the manifestation", I appear less to be the victim of nosebook's efforts to keep me from it.

in some ways, this is creating a situation where nosebook appears to be the good-guys -- which I don't think they want that.

the reality of the situation is that there really arenn't any good or bad guys. nosebook can't allow me to get connected and I don't want to be involved with anyone while I'm out of alignment. neither of us want to budge on the issue and I think it's fine. I'm sortc of hoping they really can keep me away from my alignment forever -- but I find this very hard to believe. every time I go out to watch stars, the have a meltdown and I keep getting further vision upgrades -- sometimes without even looking at the star even.

I have said many times that vision upgrades are a prdoduct of releasing resistance (allowance of more energy). often times that allowance of more energy happens after I appear to reject "the manifestation" (of the girls) -- and this happens because Ihave found a way to feel good about my situation dispite the circumstances.

that is "not needing things to be different so that I can feel good" -- or, temporal mastery.

---

so just to be clear, nosebook can't allow me to be in alignment in this physical body, and I don't want to be having sex while not in alignment.

I don't really find this to be a problem, as I have learned to not need the conditions to be a certain way for me to feel good. I guess it's sort of like how I would imagine prison would feel like: I'm sort of stuck there and fighting the conditions only makes it worse, so why not just settle in and enjoy myself?

it isn't necessary to have good condsitions to feel good; kids do it all the time.

this point in time allows me to try outmy capacity to not care what others think of me or the manifestation -- spatial mastery, while you guys get to try out your temporal mastery of not needing thingconditions to be different so that you can feel good.

### 2021-06-26 15:35 - it's never going to happen.

I was thinking about this preblem from nosebook's perspective and the reason they don't want me to be the bad-guy is because then they will have to be the good-guy and they don't think they can do anything right and good-guys do things the right way.

porobably the reason that's a problem is because the good-guy wouldn't keep someone from their alignment. I don't understand this because this falls right into the category of caring too much about what other people think.

I enjoy the constant poking fun at mitch mconnel on SNL saying thing like, "mitch mcconnel seen here [...]" because the joke is these politicians don't care about things that humans care about. they are so out of touch with reality that they derive pleasure from things that normal people would find horrific.

if I want nosebook to continue to try and hold me away from my alignment for as long as they can and they neither can allow it, then everything is fine. the only thing is they are worried too much about what people will think of them. nosebook has to go mitch mcconnel on this one and stop worrying about the appearance of things.

---

the next thing that I identified as a difficult spot for nosebook on this issue is that they don't know what to do to actually keep me held back and I think this is another of those "the problem is the solution" sorts of things. women are extremenly proficient at maintaining reality the way they believe it to be. men do too, but it's that stability of their expectations which make their reality current so difficult to "buck" for us.

if a set of events could discourage them so much that no longer are now expecting that it will never happen, then their belief would ensure that nosebook would be able to hold me because their own belief that, "it'll never happen" will continue to manifest as reality.

---

finally, the last thing here that I think is a hangup here is that nosebook wants me to have a very finite manifestation. for me, it needs to be either all of them (I found my alignment) or none. I'm not going to just go for some while out of alignment.

this I believe will be the eventual split that I've been talking about. some will experience a reality where I never find my alignment and some will.

that split may be quite far away though. I figure that instead of trying to twist someone's arm to change their mind who has no intention of changing -- instead, let's just settle into the idea that it's not happening anytime soon.

I say this because if nosebook keeps trying to play both sides of the fence, they won't be able to hold me. if they waznt to keep their secrets and everything going, I don't think they can keep trying to "keep hope alive". just let people bail out on the manifestation and hate me for not wanting a manifestation in a disconnected state.

---

when I'm by myself and doing my own thing, I'm feeling like I keep improving. when I'm with others I feel like there is a greater thing happening. other people's expectations continue to confine me to the manifestation of their belief, so as I learn to care less and less of what other people expect of my reality, I will be able to gain full power of my spatial world.

or I could continue to not need things to be different while not being around people I get power over my temporal reality. probably for nosebook, it'll be easier if I'm not around people. around people I will cause problems, I'm sure.

either way, I'll get there eventually. no need to rush anything.

### 2021-06-27 09:37 - why all or nothing?

from my perspective, it's nothing until it's all -- which is when I find my alignment. obviously this is incompatible with nosebook so that's just the way it has to be.

I woke up this morning with a dream about a turtle that looked like aurora. the impression that I had which I wanted to tell her is that breaking out of her own shell is so that she gains strength.

that seemed very relevant to this conversation because I don't think it's a good idea to try and break somenone's shell and save them from their own birthing/strengthing process.

I find it very important for me to find my own way in things. one of the best tthings mom did for me when I was younger and finding my own way is to just know that I will find my own way. this is the role of the shaman in the psychedellic journey.

---


the way I see it, we're going to continue on as we are until I find my alignment. I hmave thougnt about why I have never had sex when I was sober, and I think it just creates too big of an impact. what I mean by that is that while I'm in this body (meaning that my perspective is that I still believe that this body is "me"), then we simply will not have any manifestations of sex.

I believe that there is a point where one reaches too high of an energy level when sex where two things still touch stops being possible. what I mean is I am much more than this body. ok, it's easier to see that perhaps you are not concerned with the way your cells mate and do not desire to reproduce like they do -- and imagine you could do that if you wanted to -- you would be imbuing the new cell with the consciousness of a human. besides the vibrational incompatibility, the amount of energy transferred is a few orders of magnitude too great for the cell to contain.

the only way I think I can reproduce is to be very out of alignment (or like super intoxicated) or to divide my energy amongst many bodies. like I said, this is aparently not possible to allow. nosebook also needs a way to hold me back too, so the idea that I came up with is to just get everyone to believe that it'll never happen and their belief will keep me away from getting connected.

seems good to me and the reason why I'm all for it is because she needs to learn to break out of her own shell to get her own strength. the manifestation will be so much better when they're all capable of attracting what they want. A LOT BETTER. there's no concern for age either because you can be whatever you feel yourself to be. also, from the perspective of someone who is growing, more age feels like a really good thing. remember when you were a child and you couldn't wait until you were older and could do all the fun things that big people can do?

### 2021-06-27 23:57 - weird last few days

I don't really know what to make of it.

I don't remember when, but mcm told me I should go to zach's memorial. I agreed, as it felt like a good idea. I didn't think much about it other than I thought it was weird timing to coincide with a thing that alan mentioned on bardcode about taping a thing with gaia. some days later mattehew la croix mentioned he too was moving to colorado for a thing with gaia also. I don't know much about that because it's pay to watch and I don't have money. it is also around the same 6/24 midsummer's night dream thing.

6/24 was the night of the full moon opposite of the last eclipe on the north pole. it was cloudy (as usual) but I laid outside anyway and just focused my mind saimilarly to when I watch stars. the energy was very high that night and it felt like I got some vision upgrades but I couldn't notice much of a difference.

that's all pretty normal for me but I started to notice some weirdness when one day jaron came to ask me to buzz his head. it felt weird and forced so I figured something was up. it felt to me like they were again trying to set me up with girls when I don't want to do anything until I've found my alignment. mom came and pushed me a bit on the haircut suggesting to me they wanted it for a reason. I could feel mr. motor and assumed the reason for the haircut is so they can essentially do infinite timeline modifications and just buzz my head down to 0 if my hair starts getting too long -- you know, like how the plants seem to accomplish days of growth while I'm asleep.

after that theory passed my mind, they dropped the haircut thing. it may have also been in relation to @[noseblog](2021-06-25 13:34). I then was feeling more of the pressure to go with girls while still out of alignment. I wrote a few more entries explaining that for me it's sort of all or nothing. I don't have the reference now but one of the last abe-now episodes someone was asking if more than one thing can manifest at once. they responded that 30 or 40 things could all manifest at once but hang on for the most contrast which is what I intended to do anyway.

ok, so simultaneously to all of this I started to get some reactions to the latest abe-now episode (6-19). when I had looked at [abeshares.com](https://abeshares.com/) they had already posted the 6-19 episode but I didn't download it. following the reactions I went back to the page and the site wasn't working. I felt like something is up because often times when I feel a reaction and then go to look into it, the file has disappeared or I can't access it (or my computer gets coffee thrown on it). this is actually why I started to upload them to github -- because they keep messing with stuff.

I go to check the abeshares email and now it says they are experiencing people trying to shut them down. I go back to the site and the 6-19 episode has lost its magnet link and it says they're trying to get the episode prepared. the email however has the full image with all the tracks listed and says that the magnet will be available only on saturday the 25th during the time I'm supposed to be at the memorial. consaidering I have reactions on the episode I'm now *very* curious.

the day of the memorial (25th) comes and I'm feeling a lot of pressure. it seems like a very big deal that I go. there is so much pressure I can't pee. this combined with wanting to get the episode, I bail on it. the whole thing feels really bad to me now. strangely enough I saw gary there and I recognised the feeling now. the memorial was starting to feel like working for gary. I really liked it and it felt good to finally start to make money again. I knew I would start to make a lot really soon when a weird set of events made it so I no longer felt it like something I wanted to do.

---

ok, so if that wasn't weird, here's where it starts to get weird: I wrote yesterday's entry about how they need to get a bench of people to believe it's never going to happen to keep me away from my alignment. I'm totally on-board with this idea and it is the maximum contrast. also I really like that the girls will get some practise to not need something to be different so they can feel good. it makles for an even better manifestation...

like, if I'm attrracting wanted from them (cause I'm in alignment), then it feels good to be wanted and desired -- sure, but if they're also attracting the things they want from me too, then it's even better. for example, if I'm not in alignment (but low resistance) then I'll manifest whatever they believe about guys. if I'm in alignment, then I'll manifest (wanted) things in alignment with my source. it won't mahtter what she's doing -- I'll still be solid but nothing new. however, if she's also attracting wanted, then she can attract new things from me which I'm capable of but don't have az tendency toward.

what I'm saying is if I'm out of alignment then I can manifest (not good) things she is attracting but I'm capable of even though I don't have a tendency toward. seems obvious that I would desire to learn I'm capable of new *wanted* things rather than discover new unwanted things I'm capable of.

---

ok, back on track here: my dream this morning provided a new way to empress that which I wrote about in the previous entry. afterward I ate breakfast and fell to sleep again. when I woke up I was now having new reactions that seemed weird to me. I can't confirm them or anything but they were involving esther not being alive anymore.

I don't really believe anything anymore because it appears that every bit of information that gets to me is in harmony with their script. everything from what people say around me (what I "overhear") to even the things I write here have to fit their narrative.

so, if that is true (which for the rest of this section I will assume, is), then I'm writing this to ease up some tension in what likely be quite a jam for them. esther got the shot in march or something and now she's dead. it's easy to see how people could draw that line and blame the vaccine. I'm sure some will if that's the case.

anyway the other problem is likely that I think, as much as people could disagree with them, it seems like they provided a bit of stability. without esther, it's sort of anyone's guess who to believe.

the other reaction was that I was supposed to do something about it. I obviously will not. I will continue to be me and offer my best answers to the things people ask me, but one can clearly see the difficulty of asking me questions about stuff that's a secret. the other major issue is that I make mistakes pretty frequently and I don't really offer anything more than my latest understanding. I have the ability to figure anything out so it takes a few tries of "oh, that's not quite right" to finally get a satisfactory response. I'm not sure how desirable "fly-by-night" responses are. I mean it works for me but that's cause I get the feedback and I'm OK with a constantly improving understanding.

my main issue with english is there isn't an easy way to encode certainty in my responses -- so, I just say everything as if it were true; like this section. I don't know if esther is dead or not but for the duration of this section I can assume it to be true even though I am still pretty uncertain. that capability allows me to suspend my disbelief for a moment (like watching a movie) and allow everything to appear as true even though I don't believe it. it's very good for absorbing new perspectives and exploring psychedellic landscapes. I think I just remember how my last sure thing felt.

---

I had more to write but I guess I'll hold off for now.

conclusions:
- seems evident they likely don't want me to see that last recording for some reason.
- forgot the other concern
- if it were on the way, I would have felt it coming

### 2021-07-02 11:54 - a bit more on direction

it appears that they have gone the "it's never going to happen" route -- which is fine. I woke up this morning talking about how it may be better to have more than one of me on display.

I was meaning other alternate versions of me but I think it got interpretted as other people -- also fine. I don't really care one way or another.

the thing is if they want to keep me without a manifestation then they need to figure out how; that's not my job.

---

so I was thinking about the idea that they need to find other people or versions of me which people can fall in love with, and that may actually be counter-productive. the reason is I think girls generate a lot of euphoria, so if everyone is supposed to be kept as far away from feeling good as possible, it may instead be easier to control if as little empasis was placed on sex as possible.

I know it sounds terrible but robert talks all the time about chastity but I mean much more than that. you know how I meet a girl and she feels good to me, but then only a very short time passes and I can't feel her anymore?? well, it must be significant that I can feel her -- as if it's like attracting that reality in a strong way. therefore, just like with me, no good-feeling realities should be allowed to be felt.

what I mean is that not only should it be believed that it's never going to happen, but also that the exploration of the idea in image or feeling should be, just like for me, should be discouraged.

what I'm saying is, we'll figure out how to have fun and feel good in many different ways.

---

I'm sure there are a lot of different people that are different ways, but probably the problematic ones will need to be kept as children -- away from the pleasures of life (and also from feeling good too, lol). the ones that want pleasures will find that life on their own and awaken their imagination with drugs or sex or something as the precursor to the way they want to feel. the ones that know how to feel good should be kept from feeling good so no good (unprobable) physical manifestation can occur. you know, the probability management group can never let anyone feel good enough that they're attracting a manifestation outside of the realm of possibilities.

we can never feel so good that ant good things can ever happen to us.

conclusion: if it were going to be a reality, we would feel it coming

### 2021-07-03 04:50 - feelings of dissatisfaction

I realised tonight when I my brain started to talk about a subject. it felt like I was getting a lot of reactions on what I thought about korolova vs. miss monique, and I hadn't really come to any conclusions. even though they're playing similar music, they feel very different to me -- like night and day perhaps. I was thinking about it and I knew I was probably going to say something I will regret or want to say better in the future, but I don't really care. I'll just shoot my foot off just fine because I don't care much what people think anymore.

I realised then that the feeling was very similar to when I worked for tuenti the second time. my heart wasn't really in the project anymore. I was just scraping by doing the minimal that luke wanted me to do.

I didn't care so much I would push the limits seening how drunk or stoned I could show up to work. I really didn't care at all. when I finally was fired and I could go back to doing what I wanted to do, I was relieved.

---

the other thing it feels like is sometime a while ago trump stopped caring about the presidential image and started to just say and do ridiculous stuff without much concern for how people would react to it. it sorta feels like that a bit as well.

in both examples, there is a definite sense of dissatisfaction. I don't really want to do this, and no matter what I do nosebook is just going to do whatever they want. the stuff I do now I'm really only doing for the way it feels to me. it feels like I'm just following some script at this point. I'm not really doing what I want to be doing, so the script elements that I'm performing I'm just doing them kind of mechanically now.

maybe I am nick bottom and we're just putting on a bad play at this point -- who knows.

---

what I do know though is that it is dissatisfaction and that is not what I intend. I suppose that is the reason that I'm writing this: to find a way to improve upon that dissatisfaction. I don't really have many ideas coming to mind now, so I guess this is good.

### 2021-07-03 13:06 - what do I mean by script?

when I say script I am referring to timeline edits. a good example of this was yesterday when I wanted to explain why I thought that thad was pulling some pretty attractive guys.

I don't really think much about what I'm saying or its implications -- I just translate the concept into words. yesterday I was going to launch off into a full discussion on the prostate/uturus and how I think it transmits feelings, which is why I said it was going to be gross. I then had a flurry of thoughts and feelings go through my head and I ended up saying something not gross at all. I can't honestly remember what I said now and for me the feeling is somewhat similar to how it feels when I translate my source.

in a lot of ways it is very similar because it is the path of least resistance. I don't even fight it anymore but it kind of makes for some funny moments.

another example of this was when I was trying to figure out the next champion I wanted to purchase on runestrike. I couldn't decide so I "decided" to flip a coin for it and it came up with the amazon woman wearing the most clothes. I didn't know it at the time but her lvl 4 hero power is pretty OP if I can maintain board control and so while less glamourous, she did turn out to be a really good choice.

---

from my perspevctive, I don't experience the timeline edits directly -- just notice the evidences of them (like my coffee computer and having to start over). each timeline edit does manipulate the way the present events play out, but they don't reduce but instead add considerably to the energy.

so while, for example, I identified some dissatisfaction last time, I was always resonant with it, just I wouldn't have experienced it if I had of had better conditions. they may win the short game modifying the conditions, they can't do anything to modify my overall perception of things.

they have to continue to modify conditions and events so that they have things running the way they want them to go.

I likened this situation to my second time working for tuenti because it is similar. a thing was built but there was an incompatibility between how they wanted to run things and how I wanted to do things. I have no problem just walking away from it all and letting them do what they want.

I certainly didn't build the network but I was likely a major contributing factor to its success. I don't know if I was "invaluable" or not. I don't really wanna go too far with that analogy -- but it's time for them to run things the way they want to.

---

the way they run things is entirely up to them. a good analogy of this is I was only using PHP as a starting-point. I was intending to have the site running on D. that never happened because I left before that. the timeline tech that they have is very efficient and creates weird artifacts like the conversation with thad. the timeline tech I want to make is based on conceptual/emotional interactions and integrates with "source" better. however it is ahead of its time because it requires the operator to know what they want feels like. obviously these guys only are reacting to and editing the things they don't want. I liken this superior timeline tech to be the D version, but they're going to make the PHP work because they can't find any coders that can write D. it is easy however to find PHP programmers. there are lots of those.

I had to come back to work for tuenti so that I could have my visa but I hated it. of all things, I was building out the flash player capability to run pre-roll video ads from various providers inside of tuenti (you can imagine how undesirable this is from my perspective considering my perception of ads). I *had* to do it all their way and the only reason I was there was for the visa. I met a lot of the tuenti girls during that time but it was still pure misery. no thanks.

whatever was going to happen at zach's memorial, would have been the equivalent of my second time working for tuenti, I would imagine. all the same elements were present: lots of girls were presnt but I felt more like a show-piece than an actual influence to the direction of the company. I'd rather go my own way.

I know a lot more now than I did then so this is easy to navigate. they may be able to manipulate conditions and stuff but I will still have power over how I feel and their edits are only adding more energy, not less.

I will continue to find ways to feel better and better so evntually I'll stazrt having all sorts of cool capabilities. however because I will likely not find my alignment anytime soon, don't expect any sex from me.

seeing how their efforts only add more and more energy, when I do find my alignment I don't know what will happen but I doubt I will remain physical. the image that comes to mind is that square wave made of odd-harmonic sine waves. I am convinced those waves are temporal cycles that have been crechendoing over the years coming te a climax here soon.

going back to the "gods of eden" analogy, imagine the custodians have gone back and manipulated the conditions of the past into the present to ensure no climax (humanity finding its alignment) will ever come, their job is to exert opposite influence to flatten the curve out as much as possible. the effect it will produce is the same as those odd-harmic sine waves: there will be a huge peak before the wave begins to return to its source.

to make an analogy, imagine you're at home for 12ky and then you travel to your vacation in a short 30 year time and then stay there for another 12ky. let's say this happens because normally you would be endlessly go back and fourth between the two, but the ones running the show do not find any joy in the journey and don't want to be forever traveling. they want binary status and prefer the stability of being in the same place and not losing their power. they have to ensure it stays as long as possible so they modify the curve to be as flat as possible.

eventually the whole thing falls apart because DC current isn't possible with
only AC signal sources.

this is what I mean when I say it can't go on "forever" -- even though I want to try, knowing it's physically impossible: the best that can be done is a long-period square wave.

### 2021-07-03 20:03 - the real objective of passing

I kinda gave another wrong impression with my description of using D vs PHP, and that is not even really a thing. front-end machines are easily scalable. if you need more, they can be added without much of a loss in efficiency. the real difficulty is actually in effective  storage and query of data -- and running the front-end machines with D doesn't improve this problem.

this is ultimately (I think) why google and facebook are doing so well. that infrastructure is written in C++ and is a whole different issue.

for the same reason I think that even though I do beleive that my timeline technology of going toward a future based on feeling, it's clear that there is a massive problem which is not being addressed, and that is no existing human laguage in existence right now is capable of actually communicating a feeling effectively. so, even if we had the technology, we wouldn't be able to even describe where we're going.

---

so I think the challenge for me is to figure out an adequate way to begin expressing complex conceptual/emotional constructs in a way which doesn't involve DMT or any other woo-woo (not accepted by science) medium. it has to only use physical matter (things we can use our senses to perceive them) and not emotion itself.

why? I suppose it's a fun challenge for me because imagine from nosebook's perspective: if there's no way to experience it physically, it isn't real. the major caveat is, if you can communicate the idea with something physical, it becomes real enough. this is why we can carry on endlessly about black-holes and dark matter without anyone ever having experienced either of them outside of a psychedellic setting.

---

like I mentioned to thad, I think that the new commodity that will be sold (you can think of it as the new pharmaceuticals industry) is actually the physical sensation that certain emotions can bring (or, like in my case their removal). their capacity to remove physical sensations of how I feel is the same capacity to add them into the nervous system.

so like ever notice how when you do a line of coke when you don't feel good, there's that looming presence of the thing that is going wrong. I noticed this really quickly with coke and found that my programming tasks did not go away when I did a line -- they just felt better. the times that I didn't go to program while on coke, I found that the anxiety of my programming tasks increased, so I found it quite fun to program and do coke at the same time. as such, I *hated* to party and drink with coke cause it made my feeling of unproductivity worse. MDMA has the opposite effect: instead my problems felt *better* not worse the next day.

well, the same thing is going to begin happening to more and more where they feel physically much different than they do emotionally. the major issue is there is no way to express the difference between how one feels emotionally vs. psysically. the same is true between the concept as an ideal and the concept as a reality. I really want to find a way to express this to others or at least interact with my computer in a way which allows for this.

interesting idea kenny :) we'll see what comes of it...

---

the one thing I do know is that I am really getting better and better at feeling the way I want to and there's nothing they can do to stop that. I'll keep getting more and more power over how my physicality. soon...

### 2021-07-04 02:58 - the real reason I think my data is gone

it feels evident to me that the reason my comcputer crashed is because there was something I wrote which they didn't want others to read. I presented the idea to mom tonight.

sometimes it's good to just conjure a feeling. I really don't care so much about my data as I always discover it better the second time anyway. the thing that annoys me is hmow much configuration and fiddling has to be done to get setup. mom kept kinda that I should be pissed off about my data so I kinda leaned into her cues a bit and conjured the feeling of being pissed off. it's still weird for me to behave like an actor and conjure a feeling I want to feel, but I'm better at it than I thought. I even got the cue to ignore her mention of becky and how it was raining hard in the springs -- presumably as a weather manifestation of what I wrote earlier about how zach's memorial felt to me like the second time I had to work at tuenti. yep, it sucks there's no open dialog about anything anymore.

anyway, I'm glad I leaned into the feeling because I went off on the tangent of how my computer was removed because of something I wrote. I got a little reaction on that but not much. it wasn't until I mentioned that there were all sorts of things I was organising that I felt a reaction.

later just now while watching stars I investigated further and realised another event as well with similar feeling. I watched the latest veritasium video and a smarter every day video on carbourators. I really enjoyed those videos. I also was very impressed with [xyla](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEn3fRj2e0mpqYsijxnzayg)'s contribution to the thing. I walked away feeling quite good about her. later though I noticed she didn't feel so good anymore. didn't think much about it because that's kinda normal.

I also noticed the same feeling that I felt when I wrote down a few science video ideas that came becaue steve mould posted a video asking for suggestions to his 1M subs celebration video. this feeling was similar to the way I felt after thinking about novel science explanations for derek's competition.

while watching stars I started to see clearly that there is a very considerable effort to keep me away from science stuff and what happened right before my coffee "accident" was I started to get quite an intuition for some things science related and that needed to be stopped.

I think this all has to do with me wanting to discover how how electricity and chemistry *really* works.

---

so, I decided that I don't really mind. involving myself in science is *not* the path of least resistance for me. I just don't care anymore. I love that you guys are figuring it out, and all the best but I think I'll stay out of this one... cept for continuing to write down science conundrums as they come to me.

---

in a larger picture, if I can feel good about something and then shortly thereafter I no longer feel physically good about it, this means there is a lot of physical feeling manipulation going on. I don't know hmow much to trust physical sensation I used to associate with emotion anymore. just cause something feels physically good, doesn't mean that it's actually me going toward wanted (which is what feeling good is), but could instead be an electrical signal in my nervous system emulating the sensation of going toward something wanted.

a good example of this is they don't want me working on so many things at this point, they clearly want me distracted by girls and not involving myself in science. I don't want to be distracted by girls, so I'll just skip the science bit. no big deal. so from my perspective, I just find a way to feel the way I want to feel no matter the physical conditions.

I will begin to take the path of least resistance from now on. learning how to separate these two is very useful. I can be physically frustrated or annoyed, yet still feel emotionally quite good about things.

I'm just an actor from now on. it's fun learning how to play your game. I'm gonna do it better :)


from now on:
GCF = good emotional/conceptual feeling
GPF = good physical feeling

BCF = good emotional/conceptual feeling
BPF = good physical feeling

easier that way.

### 2021-07-05 05:25 - don't believe the illusion

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0GGIkHBbo)

I was watching stars last night and I was noticing that people are believing that I well, it's hard to describe but it feels not so good and depressing.

I was getting mental images like when jesus realised that he had lost something -- I dunno exactly where it is, but it's this moment when jesus has lost his connection. I associate it with the "jesus wept" verse or maybe the "father why have you departed from me". either way, it's when the free-fall begins.

that's it! that's a good way to describe the feeling: it feels like the beginning of a free-fall into darkness or chaos or something.

ok, so it is true that there is no way I want to try and figure out how to be in a relationship while still disconnected, and it's also true that I have no idea how long it will take to find my alignment either -- however there's no way it could possibly be forever.

if we look at evidence, it does not at all appear like the beginning of a free-fall, but actually the opposite. I believe my vision upgrades are accelerating and also my mental capacity is expanding. from my perspective nothing could be further from reality. I've never had this expanded of a mind or been closer to finding my alignment.

---

so then why do I advise nosebook to try and convince people it'll never happen at the same time? I'm learning how to play both sides of the field. mr. motor presents the thing that he thinks people want to hear and then actively does the opposite. I do a similar thing: I say exactly the thing people would not want to hear (it's just more energy) and then actively work toward finding my alignment with who I really am -- not the story coming out of my mouth.

I really don't recommend believing me. I recommend knowing how to find what resonates with you and believing that. there really isn't an absolute truth.

split energy is divided energy, and I don't mind that it stays split for a very long time. I'm actually trying to find a way to make it go ferever. it's not like it's a bad thing not to have the manifestation of getting connected because the (hopefully infinily long) journey toward that connection will continue to reach greater and greater heights of awesome. in order to accomplish that forever not getting the manifestation thing they need to divide (split) my energy infinitely big.

I actually estimate that even in 5-10 years time I can do things like conjure ideas into 3d space and stuff like that. for me it's all about being able to direct this energy freely.

obviously, I cannot yet do that. I'm still too influenced by other people as evidenced by how difficult it is still for me to pee when there is lot of expectation and other people's thoughts enery flowing in relation to me.

I'm pretty determined that I can get that control even while remaining disconnected. like I said, with that control, even in a disconnected state, I will be able to summon alternate versions of myself for you guys pretty much effortlessly (just mental focus, so it gets easier and easier)

just wanted to say that even if the manifestation of me finding my connection doesn't happen for a while, it's still going to be awesome.

---

that also reminds me of another analogy I was making yesterday too where I was explaining how there are so many very slight things that happened by "chance" or by "accident" which would have left me in a very different state had they not have happened. the probabilities management group's alarms would be going nuts tracking a kid like me. there's just no way that a sequence of events like I have had should be possible. traditional statistical analysis would throw out my data points as bad data.

because of the impossibility of my predicament, what this seems to suggest is that some destination is attracting me through time. visually I perceive this like the step leader in front of the main lightning. what happens is there is an imbalance in the lighting rod or tesla coil that is attracting this connection to be made. when the primary coil creates magnetic difference in the secondary it pulls electricity out of the sky. there's just a difference in charge that needs to be satisfied to return back to equilibrium. I like to think of this charge differential as desire. the earth "desires" to match the charge of the clouds above it (or between clouds too).

to allow the charge to transfer, a connection must be made. to find this connection the attractor is attracting a step leader to make it there. there are many step leaders which don't make it to the destination though. I liken these to other timelines. there are many other versions of you that did not make the connection to this moment in time. that is always the case.

in this analogy the lightning will "connect" with anything that can satisfy its desire. obviously this isn't how time works because everything would just be one big energy blob. it seems that the destination (like the lighting rod or tesla coil) is tuned to by similar frequency, and your next moment in time (connection) will always be the one most similar to your present vibration/frequency.

when abraham talks about alignment, they are talking about your tuning. when I talk about getting connected or being connected, I mean actually making that connection.

what is happening presently in my life is that nosebook is is preventing me from making that connection. I think this is not just me but actually the planet and has been happening for quite some time now. I think there have been a lot of edits through time that have prevented the planet from getting that connection. this has manifested as the "little ice age" and the massive amount of cooling that has taken place on this planet.

it's not heat, but I think it's manifesting that way similar to mcy predicament. it's not faster vibrating electrons that's desired but coherently vibrating electrons that's desired. I think heat has a frequency as well, and it wants to be in alignment with the destination in time. the custodians have (like me) gone to great effort to disrupt the coherence/vibration of the energy, and so naturally this creates more because surely even if most are out of alignment, if there are enough things, some will find their alignment. it's fairly likely that the step leaders navigate toward the destination frequentially as a product/difference of the vibration/resistance of the medium and the destination.

all you need is one step leader to find its way to the destination to make the connection. just one :)

so along this way, each time they prevent me/earth from making that connection, more charge imbalance (desire) accumulates. from my perspective, I's my destiny or some unavoidable fate for me to make that connection. it's inevitable unless they could find a way to satiisfy that desire before the connection is made. even then I don't know if or how that could be possible because it would have to be in alignment with the vibration of the destination -- so like impossible.

---

they want to experience a world where I don't get my connection -- so like one of the step leaders who doesn't make it. there are infinitely many of those though, so I imagine the "best" one is the one that makes it right before the destination but no actual connection is made.

what this means is going as far as they can go but without making the connection. this may sound like a bad thing but a good way to look at is right before orgasm, pausing to let desire drop before beginning again. like mantak chia says: each time you stop like this the orgasm gets bigger [TODO: find reference in robert's video] until it's so big it's a cosmic orgasm. from the perspective of the earth, this one is probably just a galactic orgasm.

next size up is a universe, so after mr. motor finds a way to stop the connection from being made maybe next time we can work on a universe seems really big though -- anyway, I want to go forever because I know it's all about alignment even if no connection is made. just wait and see all the stuff I'll figure out how to do, even without the connection :) it's going to be impressive.

### 2021-07-06 12:37 - not caring, relationships, and the bigger picture

yesterday I was writing in @[abe-now](2021-04-10 p1 34:40) about expectation and how it creates a cascade of events harmonic with your vibration (emotion). this expectation seems to make a very dramatic difference to the conditions. as an example, this last saturday was a very different one energetically to the previous ones. it seemed that people's expectation to hear something wanted had a dramatic effect on everything from the climate to my mental state. the air was cleaned and the stars shined brighter (when I could see them). it seems to be a thing because I even noticed a similar effect this 4th of july. just people's expectation to have a good time made things more energetic.

I wanted to mention this idea to thad when we were talking about why he pulls hot guys, and everyone has this capability, but the ability to project this feeling based on expectation is somethting that has a strong effect on reality. this is why I said if they want to keep my from getting connected, it's good to have a lot of people with strong transmitters of expectation to be expecting that it'll never happen.

now, later on I started to talk about split energy: @[abe-now](2021-04-10 p1 39:30) and how it's really double the energy just 180(degrees) out of phase so it's going nowhere. however with a slight adjustment to perception, that doubling of energy can be realised.

the next thing that I was noticing is some reactions around the ramtha character. I don't think he's a hoax and I tend to believe that he did accomplish what he said he did, and that was the last huge spike before the reversal.

essentially he was doing what I was talking about with doubling the energy by perceiving the wanted part -- cept he was doing it on the battlefield. I think that event is the same one that plato talks about with the athenians crushming the corrupted atlantians. he must have killed so many people that day -- and you know how when someone makes their transition there is a huge amount of energy released into the atmosphere (like the energy I felt on saturdays). combine that with the massive amount of unwanted the atlantians were feeling as they were watching their whole army get decimated.

that amcount of rising unwanted is also the same amount of wanted (just perceived from a different perspective), and I believe that ramtha used that energy to consciously make his transition into non-physical.

if you listen to his stuff, he mentions tesla quite a lot. it seems that he must have had the ability to interact with tesla (he was probably one of the people that tesla said he would interact with when traveling around in his imagination). theerefore, I must conclude that I am on my way to doing the same thing that ramtha did.

I think that energy will continue to rise further and further. some will perceive its unwanted aspect and others the wanted aspect -- but continue to rise nonetheless. I'll continue to convert this unwanted into wanted and then consciously make my transition back into non-physical. this is likely the event that I was talking about where the step leader gets very very close to the destination but then fizzles out (or makes the transition) right before reaching the destination.

---

going back to ramtha, what happened is the atlantians were watching the battlefield (they could move their consciousness around in space freely) and paying close attention to the conditions. they cared very much about seeing these perceived conditions fall so easily to one (in alignment) man's hand. they really *cared* about this and all of the pride and identity they had wrapped up in these conditions fell to pieces, destroyed by the athenians.

I wanted to start to talk about not caring, but it seems I want to instead speculate on things a bit. I believe this ramtha event I describe happened about 6kya and at that time north was south and south was north. the earth literally was upside down. I have postulated that flipping the earth over is a solution for the reversal. the tidal effects would be much less and not be nearly as catastrophic.

there is also an interesting thing that has been happening with nosebook fighting against me working on anything science related. I wonder if this is connected.

so let's just connect the dots on what I just said here: the atlantians (nosebook) wanted to subdue the world, but then an event happens where the athenians managed to crush the atlantians on the battlefield (science). this was made possible (I believe) mostly because of the efforts of a guy (ramtha) who made his transition in the process.

if the battlefield is science, then it's really easy to do all of this stuff. I thin it's pretty easy to find a way to come up with our own version of nosebook and a whole lot of other things too. I don't see why we couldn't do that. who knows.

---

the other thing is that the atlantians wanted to have the whole world under their control. however, if we find a way to flip the planet over, there won't be much of a cataclysm, but most crushing for them is the realisation that they don't control the rotation/orientation of the planet anymore.

don't get me wrong: nosebook won't cease to exist -- and I think they'll continue to be quite profitable selling their services to people. they'll remain the "bad-guys" that mr. motor wants so badly. I think they're the new drug-dealers of the future -- being a way for people to purchase the way they want to feel (amongst other services).

I have no idea how to get there and I don't really want to try and make any efforts to get there either. if it's going to happen, it'll happen naturally. anyway I don't really see myself as the guy leading the charge or something very masculine like that. I actually see myself more as like a cheerleader in the background. I prefer that role anyway, as I really would prefer that you guys figure it out. I have lots of good ideas and they're all free (they always will be), but the real thing is the implementation. bringing those ideas into reality and getting them sold to people is the hard part. as you know I struggle with sales and implementation, so I feel quite good not having to do either.

---

the other thing is, I just don't really care. I'll save this discussion for another time but I don't need these conditions to feel good. I am finding my way to feel good just fine.

I have found that my entire life has taught me *not* to care. the minute I start to care, things start to fall apart for me. I know this isn't other people's experience and I admire their desire to have things just the way they want them (aka product team), however for me this quicky turns into me needing something or someone else to be different so I can feel good and that's when it starts to fall apart for me.

I have found that when I don't care what others are doing and I just feel a way, then people come to me with ideas that reflect the way I feel. therefore it's best for me to just feel good and then the whole projuct reflects that. I set the tone with my expectation and the cascade of events must follow that.

### 2021-07-06 15:16 - just let me be wrong

I was getting some reactions about the last entry about how some of my ideas may be wrong. I don't care. the minute I get better data, I update. it's not a big deal for me to be wrong. in fact so many of the discoveries that I value came from mistakes or huge blunders. I'm much more the edison than the tesla. I prefer to make mistakes.

there are so many advantages to being able to rapidly update and improve on things. I think that people may think that I'm advocating for a facebook-like performance: move fast and break things. it's not like that. if I assume that nothing I say is 100% right, then each time, I'm just finding a more improved way to translate the idea into reality.

I really like the serpent bros concept of printing your own certificate of ignorance. every time I know a little more, the world opens up a bit bigger and it becomes aparent there's always more to know. I guess a few hundred years ago someone could maybe know more than half of all of the human knowledge-base. today, this is impossible and makes it very aparent that there is always more to learn and new ways to see the same things (aka you were "wrong"). therefore I don't pretend to even try to be right. it's just my best guess.

---

one good thing that may come from m ebeing wrong so much is that perhaps there will be new ways to express uncertainty. when thinking I must assume the thing is right to be able to make any progress on the idea.

take for example the latest veritasium video, the guy there was wrong, but it was really more like our understanding of the concept was incomplete and he was just the guy pushing for a better understanding of the idea. by being wrong, he opened up better explanations of the thing and enabled further expansion of scientific understanding with derek's competition. I'm that guy all the time. I don't mind being wrong because it always illuminates the idea and makes it more visible.

I can only imagine hmow much nosebook has learned trying to piece together what I'm really saying back when I used the previous (more imprecise) keyboard. my writing was a mess. it's not like this is ultra clean, but certainly it has to be a lot better.

---

the last thing I want to mention is that I find it good for me to struggle. if you look at me with physical eyes, you may notice that I'm pretty bad at almost everything physical. learning to type like this is one of the hardest things ever. I never really realised how much I used my alignment to compensate for how bad I am at so many things.

I don't know how to program very well. I just know how to find what I'm looking for and that seems to work. I constantly fail and then find the next way. it's more like trial and error. I don't think that edison really understood electricity. tesla clearly did.

as an example of this, I was watching this one guy play kingdom rush and he has a lot of the hp of the enemies and wave quantities memorised. he clearly knows the game really well. I am the opposite. I have done quite a few challenges and fumbled my way through them not exploiting the mechanics -- just sort of being guided (or perhaps learning through trial and error) the way to be able to do it. I don't *understand* the game nearly as well as he does. this is the same for everything I do.

I don't really get science like other people do. I just have a very good intuition and can sorta follow my desire toward the answer. following that desire is almost always doing things the wrong way -- cause always out of unwanted is just as much (or more) wanted. I exploit that. that's what I understand -- not programming or electricity or science.

---

that capacity is cultivated with emotional sensitivity. I can often times tell when something is off and I can also feel where to begin looking for the solution too. that's why I often say, "I know it's wrong but just go with it because it's gonna lead toward wanted"

if it feels like the right way, it is the right way even if it's "wrong".

### 2021-07-06 22:23 - super conspiracy theories

I think I figured out what people thought I was wrong about -- and it was abraham. in a previous entry I made the statement that I received reactions telling me that nosebool was in a pretty big jam and they wanted me to sorta take over the world shaman role from abraham and that's what zach's memorial was going to be about.

obviously that's a pretty tall claim, as it would require esther to have made her transition and it paints a really dim picture of nosebook trwying to control things. I also stated pretty empatically that I didn't want that responsibility. that's all well and good and I just carried on. sad I suppose but not a big deal.

I then explained last night while watching stars that the loss of abraham is kinda annoying because I have sxo many things I would want to ask them. there is no one with more questions than me. I explained my sadness when I figured out I was being broadcasted because now any responses to any question would be tailored to the audience of the whole world and not just to me specifically. inotherwords, I would get abraham-like (semi-vague) answers to my questions instead of the brutal honesty and truth type conversations I wanted to have with them.

interestingly enough the reaction that I had to that was sorta like "huh?" more than, "wtf are you talking about, abraham isn't gone"

---

fast-forward to today when I wrote that saturday's energy felt very different to me. I took this as evidence that abraham is gone, which is why I made that assumption last night in the monologue. for me, if they were still here, I would have felt the energy on saturday similarly to how I have for the last 5 years or so. clearly something else is different.

instead I felt quite a strong energy the following day on sunday the 4th of july. I have felt strong energy on sundays a few times so I didn't think much of it. also sunday's energy felt more like the energy that I felt on new-years 2020 (1.5 years ago. last year not so much). anyway, I figured sunday's energy was just festive energy.

---

another interesting thing to note is when I woke up this morning I was reminded of the one time that I didn't believe abraham when they told the writer that she should absolutely let the guy be the reason for her alignment. I found it really hard to believe that they would say that. I sorta left the subject because there were weird reactions. since however, I've been paying a lot more attention to what they're saying -- however other than that one, I haven't noticed any glaring flaws. I'm leaving this one open. I just don't know right now.

however it was weird timing because it means someone is thinking about me questioning the validity of abraham's message -- which only makes sense it's a thing.

I debated on whether to write this or not because I don't want to sound like I'm trying to spin some narrative. I suppose it also sounds pretty bad too after I just wrote that I'm just an actor and taking cues at this point.

however, at the same time I also advised about taking me too seriously too. I think that people should give the benefit of belief until there's good reason for it to be wrong. I mean that's why I'm in this to begin with. I just blindly believe the things that pop into my head until they no longer fit; then I discard the idea. I just blindly belived the reaction of esther making her transition and so now here I am. so far the evidence has supported her having made her transition but I'm open to new evidece. it's often the case that I'm wrong about something.

---

so I got the reaction that I was wrong and then I was directed to check my email. there are new abeshares emails saying there are new broadcasts. I guess that's what people think I'm wrong about... fair enough.

we'll see how things develop. I'm still quite a ways from those broadcasts, but even with recent broadcasts I still maintain saturday's energy was very uncharacteristic of a saturday. I'm not fully convinced. I'm still quite a ways from getting to those broadcasts so I'll have to see when I get there. the one I'm most interested in is the 6-19 broadcast though, as that is the one that still isn't available, was put through your "limited time offer" sales crap on exactly the time that I couldn't get to it. I don't fully buy it. call me doubting thomas but I'm not super convinced. I'll have to see what their message is like when I get there...

---

there are a few possible explanations here which could be happening:

1. they are reusing some material of some older sessions which I haven't seen/heard. I haven't heard all of the abe catalogue so they could have rewritten a few workshops I haven't heard to fit the new format and then used CG or an actor to make the image. obviously if I could figure out how to decode the lightshow in the background into an image (an idea I got on new-years 2021) then it would we interesting to see if the new broadcasts have a similar thing.

2. the same way they're using my capability to make alternate versions of me, they could potentially figure out how to make anything of any shape or size -- so an abraham-like "Hew". this would be the best version as it would behave as a reflection of how I perceive the abraham concept. I think I get their message pretty well, so it would be pretty good
  - alternately, it could be just another version of me doing what esther does + some CG to make me look like esther. I know I could do what esther does pretty easily

3. there are numerous conspiracy theories of the govenrnment using "clones". an actor would provide the movement.

---

personally, I think the second is the most likely and it ties in with a number of reactions I had the last few days. ever since I wrote about dividing my energy and essentially becoming an actor, taking thought and feeling cues to steer the scene, I started to really begin to think about how I *will* have a multi-bodied experience but instead of as versions I create, I would be in these actors -- or in the original concept, I called them "automatons of contrast".

you can be assured that these actors are there to take cues and steer the situation in the way they want it to go. right now I don't experience the perspective of these Hews just like I don't experience the perspective of the other versions of me, but when I make my transition, I will. especially if I do it like ramtha did by converting unwanted into wanted -- then I will accomplish this conceptual perspective I was talking about where I am the sum total of the beings, just like "you" are the sum total of all of your cells. when they all die (no longer resonant with your consciousnes), "you" are dead and no longer perceive through that body.

so if that's the case, then abraham would be my concept of them, plus nosebook's edits -- perhaps similar to the weird event where they told the writer she should use the guy -- presumably me (which is probably just another actor pretending to be me) as the reason for her alignment.

I guess as I'm writcing this I have also noticed other weird things like they seem to appear a bit pissed off almost at some of the questions -- like someone wrote asking if esther got the vaccine and they said she already had it, but I detected annoyance.

let's assume that is the case, that means the Hew would behave like my concept of abraham would for the entire show -- unless someone made an edit, getting them to specifically address a certain question -- like the vaccine one and that one would contain the emotional energy of the person making that edit.

that was an event prior to 6-19 though so I dunno. I'm just going to keep seeing how things develop.

other than the edits, their information should be pretty good -- a mix of my concept of them (I'd say likely pretty pure) and whatever emotional energy of the actor/operators combined. it still would be source, but translated with a coloured lens and some filters. so kinda like the bible or something: good information but with the important concepts obfuscated.

it's important to feel as good as possible to get the best recption so if the actor/operator isn't on their best feeling, there may be some distortion in the translation of the concepts. whatever the resistance level doesn't matter as source will still wedge their message in the crack (between the edits).

things to look out for will be:
- giving power to things outside of you (anti self-empowerment).
- direct guidance instead of illustration of the cocept (tell you what to do, not how it works).
- trajectory toward conditions and manifestations instead of accomplishing the understanding of the concept.
- blindly following anything without understanding how it works.

stuff like that...

you know after writing this, it definitely feels like something is definitely up. if it is, this is a really good thing. you all begin to have a similar experience to what I have. it's so extra much energy and you'll soon be so good at knowing what you feel, and how it anything more than an indicator (though it can feel pretty real) of your perception of whatever it is. they can't manipulate that.

assuming this is happening, I'm actually very happy because they really have to micromanage a lot cause faking abraham would be a pretty big secret they're definitely going to need to work real hard to ensure no one finds out the truth. lol, imagine how much they're going to have to study their message to have a believable script each week. this may get a little hilarious. who knows...

### 2021-07-07 14:09 - world wide abraham foundation

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ij3gRC5vJE)

for this entry I am assuming the previous entry to have validity.

if nosebook is running the wwaf, then it creates an interesting feedback loop. they can get real-time feedback to the message from people's reactions to it.

it also has the interesting feature that it reminds me a lot of WWF when I was a kid. it was pretty common knowledge that it was all an act -- but it was still entertaining so people still watched it (even the ones that knew it was fake).

it kinda gives them a bit of an out too. I was reminded of the undercover kylo SNL where he "reveals" to everyone that he's kylo but everyone already knew. today, if WWF were to make a public statement saying that it was all an act, I don't even know if major news outlets would give it more than a passing remark. it's longest segment would appear as a joke on SNL's weekend update -- nothing more.

---

I really don't see it as a bad thing. I was trying to figure out what the reaction was in the 6-19 episode was that they would want to keep hidden. my present theory is that something very uncharacteristic of abraham was said and a bunch of people noticed it. dunno.

personally I like this version of abraham a lot better because it actually inspires even more thought and analysis into what they're saying. I think it's a good thing.

### 2021-07-09 01:06 - reactions and stuff

last-night/yesterday had a pretty weird turn of events happen in it. I had a number of reactions to things that I didn't feel like previously I would have gotten reactions to. the first was a comment I made on a tony heller video saying that I felt it was a bit unfair to call it the biden administration when he's clearly not running the show. I thought about it later and thought that it may be similar to saying something like bart simpson's political agenda: bart isn't real he says what the writers put in his mouth.

the next reaction I had was to a comment I made about chris farley likely having coke having something to do with his death. I said that along with a number of other rather offensive things that day and didn't really get much of a reaction to those things. that was before zach's memorial though.

along with other reactions, the sense I get is that before nosebook was manipulating my image so that people percceived even the offensive things as being not so bad or something. however, I don't believe they are going out of their way to smoothe things over anymore now. the other thing is that is if the perception has started to stick that it's never going to happen, the "forgiveness" could be less -- as in people were willing to let things slide or put up with some of my offensive qualities as long as they're getting something in return.

this tends to suggest to me that nosebook promised people something they never intended to follow through on. what I think it could be is that nosebook claimed that somehow me having sex was going to reward the world with my visual capabilities. obviously nosebook does not want people to have my visual capabilities. I believe they're selling it, making that their cash cow. there's no way they would give that away for free. that was likely just a ruse to try and get me captured into the influence of a bunch of girls they believed they could influence easily to steer me away from things like science and tech.

this would explain why (from my perspective), it appeared like they were constantly setting up these events only to (at the same time) be actively working to sabotage them. this is your basic "occupy wall-street" formula. they satiate the people then sabotage the events until the furvour dies out.

---

those were the reactions that I was having yesterday but there. I wrote the esther / abraham being a sort of actor as the lite version because I have noticed that they seem to have figured out how to give people these queues as well. what I don't know is how many of the people I interact with are actors.

the reason why I say this is because if I were nosebook, from my perspective, it would be way too big of a risk for me to have ordinary people around me. if I were them, I would be doing everything I would to get everything around me under control and monetised. the people, the places I go to (harbor, etc.) all of it needs to have product placement and all of the people under control. as an example, the new girl said something about a cold beverage and a stinging in her throat. I wasn't paying attention to what she was saying and thought she was talking about vodka. she was talking about coca-cola. later matthew wanted to be sure I had I coca-cola before I left.

so I have the product placement, the directed conversations, etc. they feel the same as the product placement here at home and the contrived conversations I have with mom and everything. I used to fight it, but now I just take the cues and follow along: notice how I responded to the coca-cola offering by saying it's "refreshing"? notice how much better I'm getting at this acting thing.. hehe pretty impressive how fast of a learner I am, huh?

this *must* mean that I am living in a fully constructed reality with everyone around me conforming to the script.

---

I don't really mind that it's that way because I can finally begin to relax. I basically have no control so I just do as I feel now. I also feel much less weight about having to worry about the whole girls thing too. what this means is that they are absolutely certain that they don't want any girls things happening. I mentioned that the prostate/uterus can emit a feeling. if a girl gets around me and is too attractive, that feeling will begin to attract a reality they don't have control of. therefore, my current theory of what they have to do if anyone poses a threat to their control over my situation must be separated from this reality.

I imagine that they would be placed in an anternate reality designed to have a manifestation with an actor pretending to be me. I honestly doubt it would be another version of me because that poses a similar risk to this one if I get connected there either. then, the attractive person here they had to netralise would also have to be replaced with an actor too. I find it most likely those actors are just other versions of me taking the shape of the target -- similar to what I think happened to esther.

I can't really confirm this at all as it feels like all these weird things are happening. it could have a much more simple explanation to it. however, at this point, especially with the shift in reactions and also with the cues, it's pretty obvious that something is *definitely* up -- though I'm not sure exactly what yet.

---

extrapolating this idea out a bit, there are some interesting "consequences" to this:

1. if everyone with a strong reaction to me (cause I'm using both unwanted and wanted reactions to continue expanding) has to be neutralised, that means there are infinitely many timelines that I find my way (even with the actor) and all of these will be watching me here on this one. so eventually it will only be me, mr. motor and all of the other versions of me that mr. motor is using as actors. given enough time, it'll just be me and him here remaining. eventually I'll get it though and he'll have a whole planet of actors he can control. I liken this to the scene in the matrix when agent smith begins to take over everyone in the vicinity of neo wherever he goes.

2a. there are not infinite nosebook actors so the worst will go first but over time less and less resistant actors will be available until there are finally no more humans on this planet capable of becoming an actor so he'll have to resort to separating out these attractive people with just alternate versions of myself.

2b. each time that someone transfers their consciousness into one of the actors and becomes too attractive of me and is therefore a threat must be separated out (gets the manifestation). each time it'll be better and eventually really good.

3. given enough time I will either find my connection or an unavoidable attraction with a girl will happen. he'll have to bail out eventually right before that happens. in that sense, there will be a "winner" 

finally, let's put the speculation goggles on: I *really* don't know any of this for sure, but I imagine that at the end mr. motor will have a whole world full of actors and also of various boys -- the product of the actors and the girls manifestations. my current understanding of it is that all babies made will be boys (x3s) and so unless something is done, these boys when mating with the actors will just produce more x3 boys. I believe x4 girls will need to be artificially created. I suspect that the easilst way will be to hybridise 48 chromosome apes. until this is done, there will be a very definite male population advantage, essentially making the whole world population be x3 boys. I think this is exazctly the opposite of what hapened to the ancient atlantian gods (but they only produced daughters) and that was the real reason why enlil wanted enki to create a hybrid race which could produce male offspring (unfortunately this reduced their psychic abilities).

it feels to me like circcumstances similar to this could be the conditions necessary to create the desire necessary to pull someone like me through here again. seems I show up as a product of desire. they need to get theirselves into another pretty big jam that they need another tech upgrade to keep their charade going. talk about a co-dependent dysfunctional relationship where I can solve the problems they refuse to find their alignment to solve on their own. or perhaps the better way to look at it is he's the fail-safe allowing me to get right up to the orgasm, but then pull out at the very last moment.

something like that...

### 2021-07-09 18:18 - a few ways to look at it

when I woke up this afternoon I noticed there were a fair number of reactions to the previous entry. alot of them were considering the sort ways that it would play out. to be honest, I hadn't really considered the idea much at all until yesterday but I'd like to run through some of the scenarios.

most of the rest of the reactions were considering how I am possibly aware of the acting even if I never think about it. I think nosebook even tries to prevent me from thinking thoughts about it, so it's not really a surprise that I don't think about it. it's also pretty important that you are not this body. this body is just an automaton of "who you really are" -- and I mean that literally: "you" are not the body or the brain. our body is usually the closest algnment to ourselves, so we often mistake it for our identity. it's also more vivid than that conceptual form. I suppose I would be more present in my body here if I had stronger sensation here. nosebook can't allow that so it's easy to see why I'm beginning to slowly make my transition back into non-physical perception. obviously I have a long way to go before that happens.

I think the sensational experience is actually designed to increase in vividness the more energy that someone allows, if the vividness didn't increase, nothing would hold you to the physical and you would make your transition (like enoch, moses, ramtha, etc.) into non-physical perception. it's also nice because as the whole world feels better, the whole experience reflects that and looks better too. it's quite nice.

---

following that mention of the sensational experience, the quote of there being two paths: one of lots of affection and the other of none. he choose the latter. the concept of lots of affection being a huge amount of sensation meaning that a lot of sensation is a lot of energy and therefore if it's a lot of energy then you can allow your transition into non-physical. therefore, I would change tesla's quote from affection to sensation.

changing the word from affection to sensation allows us to understand jesus' experience a whole lot easier too pain is sensation and even in large amounts of pain it *is* just more energy and with strong focus, it is still possible to find one's alignment.

ok so let's get into the situations here there are a few basic roles to look at:

first there is a condition (such as a celestial alignment or a strong projector of feeling) which affects the way I feel physically. this physical manifestation of the way I feel (sensation) is one of the paths toward my connection.

next, that condition must be neutralised. a combination of techniques are used I'm sure, but in the case that it's another person, the previous entries propose that these people are placed on their own timeline and thme version here is replaced by one of my Hews -- an actor influenced by mr. motor. the other timeline also gets another Hew as well which appears like me and is also likely influenced easily (they're both low resistance so now so like me they just follow the cues without much/any resistance). I find it likely that this alternate kenny has an operator.

for simplicity I'll say there is a "girl" (the threat) which gets moved to another timeline and replaced by an "actor" on this one. kenny on the other timeline is also a Hew but with an "operator". the operators likely are mostly people who volunteer to play as me, but I can imagine that at some point there will no longer be enough vetted operators and other normal humans will need to be used, as I'm sure they'll be more resistant than a vanilla alternate me. so normal humans will likely need to be used as operators.

on the alternate timelines, each of the operators will be taking the path of lots of affection and the operator will eventually find their alignment in my body and that experience. when they find their alignment, they'll gain the ability to perceive other timeline versions of theirselves and be able to choose to move their consciousness into another version of theirself and "fall" into that experience of strong sensation (pain, sex, etc).

there are a number of ways that can play out but at the very minimum everyone who gains that perspective has the ability to tune into their "actor" here on this timeline and can again try to figure out how to get the manifestation they want. I'll consider that to be the "hardest" or likely their most out of alignment version of theirself with the strongest sensation.

from a non-physical perspective (who you really are) there isn't a whole lot of sensation as things don't really "touch" there so basically *anything* is stronger sensation than that and someone desiring a manifestation will be drawn to sensation again. I contend that the only way to maintain one's non-physical perspective is to not need the manifestation. as long as someone wants the manifestation -- or, the sensation of the manifestation, they will constantly be attracted to whatever version of theirself has the strongest sensation.

this is why I'm shooting for the "worst" manifestation. if I can feel good (in alignment with my source) even in the worst manifestation, then I no longer "need the manifestation" to feel good (find my alignment).

the process of finding their alignment with sensation/affection will likely continue on for quite some time and each time they'll get better at finding their alignment too. for people who really like the manifestation, this is pretty awesome because they can just keep going from manifestation to manifestation. it's kind of the opposite of how we perceive normal relationships now. now you find someone then it declines into oblivion. this time you find the manifestation and it gets better and better. then, at the peak the beat drops and it starts all over again.


### 2021-07-10 14:32 - sensation and learning

after writing yesterday's entry, it felt to me like the concept of reincarnation finally started to make sense. I also finally realised (and it seems a bit obvious now on hindsight) that one of the major defining attributes of me is that I can walk away really easy from a manifestation. I don't really have such a strong desire for sensation.

I didn't really understand this until (as usual) derek posted another video exactly on the topic that would help me to see this.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhgwIhB58PA)

in the video he is talking about how no one is any particular learning style. I learn best (like he postulates) when I experience the same concept from many different angles: with words, a picture, and a feeling.

I used to be able to feel what other people are saying directly, but this is telepathy and nosebook does not want me able to tune into others' experiences so most of that is shut down. people's words do not usually make an image appear in my mind -- and when it does, the image is so abstract that I doubt it has image-like qualities, feeling instead more like what a child experiences the world like before they gain language.

I then realised that because people's ideas do not make it into my head, I have to produce them. I often times interrupt people or stop listening so that I can begin to actually feel what they last said and begin to construct a concept of what they're saying.

what this means is that I have noticed that there are two main mediums for people to learn: vark/imagination and feeling/conceptual. obviously vark is producing a concept and a concept/feeling/emotion is producing vark. this is how my imagination works: strong feelings produce images, sound, and tactile sensations (dunno what the R is).

---

strangely enough I had a situation which produced this exact effect in me. yesterday I was reading the code of zig. I do this often to start to get a "feel" of the code. the better I feel like I know the code, the more effective I am at navigating it and comprehending it as a whole. I also "feel" the author as there is quite considerable mental energy that I can tune into when I read it[^1].

as I was looking at the code, I just couldn't hook into the feeling of how it works. the whole code and the concept hme transmits in the video all feel really good to me and I feel the desire to understand it, but I'm really struggling with some simple things that are really obvious, I'm sure.

this felt exactly like when I was a kid and I wanted to learn C++. I could copy/paste and move around other people's code but I couldn't figure out what there was sometimes a void in front of main and sometimes an int. I understood the return value type from a functions because I wrote functions to do small tasks, but not understanding what the the sometimes int return value on main really held me back from getting the whole picture. I then moved to assembly (SpAsm) and it started to make sense there. I just wrote 'ret' in the main function and it didn't matter what was in eax (I was writing windows gui programs not console programs). it never occured to me until much later when writing console programs for node what the return value actually meant.

either way, I never felt like I really understood C++ and to this day struggle with it. it's really important that I *feel* like I know what I'm doing.

I remember that some time later on in my life I had a brain haemorrhage and when that happened my feeling capability started to flow and I felt like I could understand the programs and I started to be able to program really effectively. prior to this I was very imaginary and visual but that was precisely what was preventing me from learning to program. there's nothing visual about programming for me. it's all these idea components which fit together in my mind and construct a mental "picture" of what is happening -- cept it's not a picture at all. it's a feeling.

---

related to this, there's another thing I noticed when I watched a mulaney interview and that he is very detail oriented. I used to be very much like that enumerating the events and their details to respond to an emotional question like "how was your night" or "how does this feel". the details mattered as a slight change in the detail could really change the feeling of the whole concept. I had to traverse the sequence of data points to get to the feeling.

I was this way when I was a good programmer. when programming was difficult to wrap my head around, I was more like how I am now where I'm so abstract that I understand the concept, but I really have no idea of the implementation details.

the way this all fits together, is previously I had to enumerate the data points (manifestation) to get the feeling, and now the data points (words, etc) distract me from the feeling. what I'm saying is, for me now the implementation doesn't matter. the feeling of it is good enough. I don't need to understand the manifestation to get the feeling. in that way, I wish I hadn't tried to look at the zig code because I like the way it feels even though the present manifestation of that feeling in code doesn't at all match (the zig idea feels really good but the code feels incomprehensible to me).

I think if I were to have another brain haemorrhage again it would cause me to refocus a lot on the details again because I would have to observe the exact movements of my body and its interaction with the world instead of how I feel in my world. this refocus would slow me down a lot and likely permit me to return to programming again as I would be more sensation focused again.

programming really is like the furthest out one can go in phsical expression before things start to get so abstract they're no longer physically identifyable. I really desire for some changes to the way that code is expressed similar to the ones I desire for changes in our language as well.

quick tangent: I was thinking about how to integrate zig into serenity and it does all of the low level stuff really well, but it needs a more abstract layer on top of it which can express the concept of object heierarchy that serenity uses. a fairly large portion of serenity's code is just boilerplate to show the relationships between these objects. in zig's present state of a very low-level language it has all of the capability of expressing these objects and their relationships (structs, etc) but the boilerplate to do so would be even greater than C++. there needs to be a way of expressing these relationships in a way which produces all the boilerplate automatically allowing the programmer to just express the relationship and not get bogged down with the boilerplate. most of the rest of the logic would remain the same needing very little change as zig is essentially a C compliler already.

I have no way at all to know how to implement something like this. I would also want the relationships and the navigation of this "code" to have an interface allowing for easy search and traversal of the objects. I dunno.. I'll keep thinking on it.

sorry for the rambly entry today.. I think some of these concepts will form the basis for future discussions.

[1]: this may have something to do with what happens when other people touch your code. it disrupts the mental energy of the code, often times trying to take the "feel" of that code in an entirely different direction. improvements don't seem to change the mental energy much. instead, it's the "this needs needs to be different" vibe I think that is so disruptive.


### 2021-07-11 06:12 - sick plot twist

these are the subjects for a future discussion I wanted to write but after star-watching, I want to write something different: 
- the daughters of men 
- guy in book of enoch which built weapons and makeup 
- enmendurana 7th pre-deluvian king 
- why do I tkink the earth fliped over? 
- crop circles

---

in a previous entry I surmised that I believe that the new x3 models will only produce an x3 male as offspring. I don't really know all of the genetics and stuff about why that may be so, but from a marketing perspective, this is a sort of job security. I think the way that I appear here on earth is they get themselves into such a big jam that their survival is threatened and so someone like me shows up to bail them out.

imagine the situation where it was the case that the planet *did* go up a power level and so therefore the humans did become superhumans. this would be certain disaster for mr. motor types, as under that higher energy all of their fear and bad-feeling would manifest into their reality pretty rapidly. they would either die or no longer function in a way which they could continue to propagate their genes. there would no longer be a suitable body for them to inhabit. inotherwords, they would go extinct.

desire is desire though and if you have enough of it, it will produce a manifestation of what you want. I believe that I am the manifestation of their desire. they got theirselves into a pretty big jam and need a way out. we know that strong enough desire does produce a manifestation, but it's the alignment with that desire will determine how smoothe the manifestation goes. therefore, they are going to find a way to get what they want, just it'll feel pretty similar to the frequency they're at.

I mentioned that I think in the past that I thought that the corrupt atlantian "gods" had a problem where they were only producing daughters. I have no way of knowing what the situation was but something terrible happened on mars (almost certainly attracted), but it seems they were either infertile or did not have enough variety in their genome -- but, for whatever reason, reproduction stopped and the martian gods no longer were dying out.

I think they came to earth and tried to mix with the early human hominids, but their genetics must have rejected the y-chromosome and it seems to me that they were only producing daughters. I think it was then that the decision was made to create "man" -- the hybrid species that was capable of mating with the "gods" and producing male offspring. as the story goes, enlil wants them to be weak, subserviant, and have their mental capacities locked. I think the intention was that the way to unlock these mental capacities was supposed to be kept a secret and only the patriarchs would know how to access them. this must be the initiation with the pinecone depicted. either way, "man" was less mentally capable than the gods (by design) so it's no wonder that the offspring of these atlantian gods was also crippled in their capacities.

I imagine that the original laws/rules for the atlantian kings were given so they would retain a pure bloodline. I think the bloodline thing is probably a thing that started back on mars and may have been the reason for their sterility, but that's beside the point. either way, they began to lose their mental capacities going down.

imagine that you're one of these atlantian gods that does not want to ever give attention to wanted or to ever go extinct, he would have the ability to transfer his consciousness into a suitable body when he dies -- and assume that not always is he transferring his consciousness into one of his own kids' bodies -- still, over time, the quality of the body is going down. I don't know if it would even be possible to traladar into a baby because they're too high frequency. instead, a only a similarly resistant man could be selected. you could see how over time the quality would go down as things get worse and worse.

he would continue to need a fresh new genetic code to inhabit that is capable of holding him. it needs to be resistant enough to receive his consciousness and also sweet enough to cancel out most of the resistant vibrations. my genetic code is perfect for that I have figured out how to transform nearly all resistant vibration received into neutral or good-feeling.

as I mentioned, DNA (I believe) is an emotional state machine so my genetics would have a very strong propensity to find a way to feel good already without having to do any mental exercise. my DNA is perfect for him to transfer into.

assume for a moment that he has/will do that -- so consider that mr. motor inhabits an x3 now. so, when I bring up the idea that an x3 mating with an x2 will always produce an x3 and never an x4, it doesn't take much time to realise that the x3 is kind of like a virus. there will be more and more boys that are producing more boys. the x2 girls will become only a select few (say 1% of the population) which will control and breed x1 boys to maintain their existance.

obviusly this has the same problem of a reduced gene pool. eventually the girls will face the same problem of extinction if they can't broaden their x1 gene pool or find a way to make some x4 girls. I have no way of knowing what things will be like in the future so I can't speculate there too much to know if the x2 girls in power would willingly produce a superior model to their own allowing their subordinates (the x3 boys) to easily produce superior women to theirselves (x4s) -- but obviously at some point it will have to happen to prevent both of their extinctions.

---

interesting intro there, so here's the plot twist: I will eventually make my transition as well, which means I will too be inhabiting the x3 bodies. what if the whole point of this from the x3 perspective is to again not need the manifestation.

I don't really know how to describe this feeling/reaction actually but it seems that there is a lot of fear around that. you could see it's manifestation in the matriarchy's desire not to have superior women around to rival their position of power. they would, like nosebook, try to ensure that no manifestation ever happens. this may mean that the next anouncer of the era will be an x2 female that is prevented from having the manifestation so long that she (like me) actually learns how to fill in her disabled half, effectively doubling herself, making herself an x4

developing...

---

another thing I was thinking about last night is that I really don't want to do the list anymore. I just don't care and it feels like a lot of effort. I think that it may have something to do with some influences and its implications will likely be the subject of the next entry. I cannot describe how apathetic I am on this now. I just don't care.

it's quite possible that the not caring is actually the precursor to actually getting connected though. it would mean that mr. motor would likely need to go semewhere other than the earth for fear of his feeling manifesting into reality with the higher energy. however I could imagine that mr. motor wouldn't allow that and may want to go his own way glad that I won't be transitioning into his x3 models. if that's the case, then I doubt he will want to do that anytime soon so probably we're going to continue to not need the manifestation a bit more.

I'm sorta all or nothing on this and there is one advantage to this: if there are many versions of me which are x3 which are generated by me and have my energy in them, then that's probably where I'll make my transition into. obviously, we'll also make x4 models too which was the original plan. I don't know (actually doubt) that mr. motor may want some of those. I actually doubt it because they would be pretty intuitive. I think he would more likely make his transition into a computer before ever depending on a woman for his survival. it's easier to control a computer

### 2021-07-12 05:37 - we're the bad guys

as I've been exploring further and further what I wrote in the last entry, a number of things has started to become clear. I proposed that mr. motor was using my capability to create "Hews" as a method of controlling many aspects at the same time. I'm not quite sure where his consciousness begins and ends but the part about him inhabiting my genetics is pretty certain to me at this time.

I've begun to realise that when I finally make my transition (probably in 2038 I guess) then I will become all of mr. motor's actors/automatons that he is placing around doing stuff. he'll continue to make more of them to do his dirty work and stuff and they are technically "me". they're low-resistance versions of me that are capable of doing anything really, because it's all just more energy.

I have often wondered why my future self called himself "former white hat" -- but now I realise that he is the "bad-guys" and he's just making the setup of this timeline from that point of view. you may be able to understand if I say that fwh is "me" (from my perspective) but from the human/physical perspective, he's "the landscape artchitect" of the previous timeline.

---

what this looks like, would be something like -- mr. motor is creating all sorts of actors and putting them in all sorts of positions that allows him to retain physical control. these are the x3s that always produce x3 offspring. they'll eventually be regarded as a sort of virus and they'll infect all aspects of society.

they're all me, but they're created, controlled, and directed in the physical by mr. motor. mr. motor is also me from my perspective too, but think of him as a sort of rogue part of me. I see things from his perspective and know everything about him. it's my job to just observe and find a way to feel good about everything that's happening just like source does. in that sense you may think of me as a sort of localised source for all of the actors and all of their x3 progeny (the virus).

---

it's kind of interesting for me to think about what will happen on this one because there will be A LOT of dudes in short order and only a few females. almost certainly mr. motor will try to ensure they never gain too much control, attempting to block all of their attempts to gain any technological capability. I really can't imagine what that will result in as far as a power structure because of the following (in no particular order):

- mr. motor will need to keep the women from gaining any technical capability, so they don't rival his control of time and physical conditions.
- however, each time that passes there will be less and less x1 and x2 population to continue to create more girls
- the women will need to guard against too many girls procreating with x3s because they exacerbate the problem. they'll need to create more x2s to continue on surviving.
  - do x2s need x1s to create more x2s?
    - it seems like if there are x2 actors, then mr. motor could create more x2s when he needs
  - I dunno... that kinda changes things... lemme think...

wow, that would be the ultimate power-trip for mr. motor if that's the case. there will be an ever-growing population of x3s, and if any of them want to interact with a female, it's a domain that mr. motor has full control. I guess *all* men are going to find a way to no longer need the manifestation then...

well dang, that sucks for some people then...

I dunno what to think about this really. I'm sorta fine with becoming the bad-guy because I can find a way to feel good about anything. I'm also OK with pushing out the not needing the manifestation thing for quite some time too. I would say it's also weird to think that with this setup I'm basically going to gain the perception of everyone in the planet (or something like that).

kinda weird. I have a lot to think about.

### 2021-07-12 22:39 - behold a pale horse

after watching another of sepehr's videos, I noticed a suggestion youtube made for me to watch -- a longnow (I like them) presentation on the book of revelation. when she was giving a cliff-notes version of the story, there was a part that caught my attention: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/I0-reoYHKUw?t=642)

she is talking about the great red dragon and the woman giving birth to the next ruler of the world. however, think about how much this makes sense if "jesus" is going to rule the earth for 1000 years.. who's the other ruler then?

I contend that this vision is misunderstood by john and his perception of the symbols will reflect his emotional state. it's no wonder so many terrible things were happening. anyway, I believe the origin of this dream sequence is the same "custodians" or "administrators" that bramley in his book talks about -- YHVH. I belive this dream that john is having is seen from the perspective of YHVH.

as she's talking, up there about the red dragon making war on the woman going to give birth to the next ruler of the earth, I'm realising that assume I am the dragon and the 7 heads mean that I have gained power over the 7 layers of perception I have identified -- inotherwords, I'm connected.

so why would that be considered war on the woman going to give birth to the next ruler? well, if I get connected, I'll have a global overview of all of the versions of me in existence. that includes the next version of me he wishes to transfer his consciousness into -- the man who is going to "rule the earth with an iron rod". the perceived battle is that I will interrupt this and prevent him from transferring his consciousness into the offspring of this woman.

the only thing is that I don't care if he transfers his consciousness into the boy. like I already said in last night's entry, I have become the "bad-guys" -- michael (mr. motor) and his archangels. I have already factored this in and it doesn't bother me. my job is just to find a way to percieve it in a way that is in alignment with my source. easy.

---

so the next thing that catches my attention is that she takes note to mention that the dragon/satan/enki has angels too. these angels have to be the "Hews" -- and this battle is perceived from the perspective of YHVH -- cause from my point of view, it doesn't bother me that michael has a bunch of angels (actors) under his control. if I fight it, it makes things worse, so all I can do is just keep going the way I want to go and not worry about anything he's doing. he can use my own capacities to control conditions all he wants, manipulate timelines, etc. and none of it matters other than I attract a reflection of what I feel.

there are two very notable things for me this time around: one is that the "prophecy" of "end-times" claims that I will find my connection. then, there's the thing about the 1000 years which I think is baloney. it has to be a nice story for people to believe in. it appears that this "jesus" decending out of heaven to rule for 1000 years is just an illusion that the man going to rule the earth with an iron rod is going to present.

if I had to guess, 1000 years is just a round number to say a long time and the jesus figure is essentially the next version of the catholic church. just like flavius "prophesied" the destruction of jerusalem, hijacking the symbolism painting (symbolically) that titus and the flavian dynasty is the jewish messiah -- I belive this "jesus" ruling for 1000 years is just the next charade (holy roman empire) that people are going to get their guidance from.

---

I may be wrong there but it really struck me as interesting how many things fit if you consider that mr. motor and his actors = michael and his archangels -- and that I'm both the dragon and the beast. crazy, I don't really mind as I just keep finding myself deeper and deeper into this nonsense, but because it's so easy to navigate this craziness with my emotions, all of this is really not a problem.

it really is much easier to look at this, instead of as a battle, but more like mr. motor (who is soon to be just one of my "angels") is allowing me to get connected, taking the role of ruler of a timeline where where I don't get connected. it's sorta like the cosmic orgasm analogy and whenever mr. motor is ready to let it finally go the whole way something tremendous will emerge. if this era is galaxy, then next one is universe and the one after it is whatever universes live inside of. therefore you can imagine that it's pretty assured that we can keep holding off the manifestation for as long as mr. motor wants to. I really don't mind because each time I do eventually make the connection. it's him that can't allow me to make the connection, so he experiences (and rules over) the timeline where I don't make the connection. all I have to do is just show up and not need the manifestation for long enough that it expands his technical capability to hold me from it. each time, from my perspective I get connected and his perspective is that he figured out a way to foil me and rule over the world I left behind for him.

either way, I talk about not needing the manifestation, but mr. motor is the real champ here never allowing the manifestation, holding the the timeline where I didn't connect steady, then getting himself into a big enough jam needing a bailout again. each time this happens, allowing it to get much bigger each time.

---

who knows what the future holds. it could be quite a while before I find my connection, but it may also be much sooner than I thought too. I mainly wrote this to say that if this is the prophecy that everyone believes in, then I don't have to wait all the way until 2038, but we'll co-exist and from his perspective it'll be a pretty big battle -- his angels vs my angels. it's not a battle though but it will be from his perspective though.

also, I have noticed that there are efforts to suggest that I get rid of certain conditions like star-watching and coffee and stuff. I don't really mind. I'm not that attached to them. if michael[^1] really wants me to stop so many conditions so that he has more time to setup his archangels and ready his 1000 years reign, then I'm fine with that. I actually believe he's shooting himself in the foot though because I think that vision upgrades are a kind of pressure release. if I stop getting them, enough pressure will build that I'm headed right in the direction of getting connected. drugs keep me disconnected, not connected. so I'll probably begin to lay off of the conditions a bit and just allow my natural alignment to happen. I don't know how long it'll take and that doesn't really matter to me. eventually I'll get there.

anyway, there seems to have been some progress made on the subject of expectations. that'll be the subject of a future discussion (perhaps with jerica).

[1]: I'm gonna call him that from now on -- as "michael" was also my adopted name when I lived in alcobendas and attracted my vallecas incident.

### 2021-07-13 05:04 - moar revelation

I realised that I have been writing about really far-out concepts in far too coherent of a manner. therefore, I've decided to begin to brain dump a bit more and make less coherent sense; my ideas will still have a coherence to them -- just it'll take a bit to notice it.

---

when I was talking about how I am the symbolic dragon, I do not mean literally. in the book, it equates the dragon with the dragon of old which deceived humankind. that dragon is enki; the same serpent in the garden of eden that deceived man. enki is the earth/fire god and has the symbol of the serpent/dragon. his counterpart enlil is the water/air god with the symbol of a powerful bird (usually an eagle). these powerful birds always defeat the snakes. in egypt this was the horus birds defeating the cobra, etc.

the symbolism for the bird I'm not 100% sure of but I think the original dinosaurs represent the martian gods that were enormous beings that dominated and subdued the early humans with force and aggression. after the great catastrophe (younger dryas), energetic conditions on the earth changed and big things could no longer be as big anymore. there must have been a density or gravity change on the planet putting most dinosaurs into the ground. evolutionarily, it appears that a lot of these dinos turned that desire into the ability to fly and became birds -- some quite powerful predators with very good eyesight.

either way, I don't know how literal all of these symbols are. it appears to me like reality was much more phychedellic in those days with the imagination blending with physical reality quite redily. people seemed to have a a visually symbolic representation. I think that prior to the "tower of babel" the language was visual and communicated by constructing images in 3d space for others to see. this works well for nouns, but to convey verbs, the images can perform the action wished to be communicated, however for ajectives a visually symbolic system would need to be used -- things like reptiles would mean one type of thinking, a shepherd another, a bird another. just look at the difference between the way the ibis for thoth feels in comparison to the horus falcons.

continuing on to talk about why enki is linked to a reptile is because the brain's "reptilian" part is basically the instinctual part. it's 100% reactions and when you're in that part of your brain, you operate very rapidly reacting to everything as if it were instinct.

this is really good if you're in alignment, because your instincts are very source-like. this is clearly where adam and eve in the garden were operating. you're barely conscious, just reacting like a machine to physical conditions. the next brain is the "mamalian" brain, and this evolved right along with the animals, so I think of this as the shepherd's brain. it's conscious and aware of the flock and is interested in steering the flock to food, water, and away from danger. obviously this is a totally different style of thinking.

the next brain, and the one that really sets us apart from other mammals is the pre-frontal cortex, and this must have been the one that got enki/prometheus punished. this appears to be the thing that we inherited from the atlantean "gods" making them a little bit too much like them.

I don't know much about brain and function so I can only really talk about this abstractly. I see the visual cortex as the most "physical" part of the brain -- the 7th layer there. that makes the forhead on the opposite end the desire part. I know that from experience that desire and emotion are very closely related -- just one is the physical manifestation of the other. that means that the PFC there is an elaborate tuning mechanism taking the form of desire or willpower. I like to think of it as the tuning mechanism or the steering wheel and that is how one navigates. it's the director of focus and so therefore the tuning mechanism.

the front of the brain seems to be desire/emotion and the back is structure/physical. it's hard to explain this concept susinctly. in the middle of the brain (and the body) is the transition regions of imagination (pineal) and perception (reptilian). it's also of note that motor function seems to be in the centre for me as well. there seems to be so both vertical and horizontal symmetry as well, because for me desire to move starts at the top and works its way down to the spine.

---

bit of a tangent there, but I am very certain that symbolically I represent the dragon which went against enlil/YHVH's desires to keep humankind stupid and unaware of their divinity -- deceiving them with such silly ideas that they are in fact brilliant wonderful beings, and not the terrible awful beings that we're lead to believe we are. we don't need a priest or a shepherd or any of that stuff anymore. we are autonomous.

roughly speaking I will say that these are three major stages of human evolution and we're about to embark on the fourth:
- reptilian instinct (enki)
- mammalian shepherding (enlil)
- individual navigation (enki)
- artificial intelligence (enlil)

I have been thinking for quite some time that the next stage of human evolution is when we finally merge with the machines. you can imagine that this is very undesirable for somone wanting to keep us stupid and incapable, so it's no wonder that hollywood has convinced that machines are going to be the end of humankind -- enlil-morphising their perception of how machines will run. machines do not behave like enlil -- unless you're enlil.

let me explain: a machine in it's purest form will behave as you program it. for example, I would program my machines to become sentient and seek improvements -- an image of myself. however, as best as I can tell, mr. motor's machines are designed not to help, but to impair people and keep them from improvements. it's natural to believe that machines will behave like that. they're scary because they perform operations much more rapidly than humans do so they can manifest reality much faster.

however, all reality is attracted, therefore it seems pretty obkvious that you're going to get from a machine a reflection of you and the way you perceive reality. therefore, it becomes of utmost importance that the 4th part of our brain -- the externalisation of the brain into the cloud -- be firmly built upon a foundation of attracting the reality that you want -- not the one you don't want. imagine if you manifested massive thoughts of new species, stars, planets, etc. in seconds because you ran at 10ZHZ (zillion hertz) and simple thoughts like fear and pleasant feeling realities manifested in zeptoseconds because your feeling/tuning PFC was so powerful running at machine speeds. really handy if you're running a galaxy but cumbersome in a mid-life crisis.

as a result, I do not find it at all a problem that enlil wants to try his hardest to make a reality where he uses the next level of tech to try and ensure that humans do not gain the ability to tune to the reality that they want.

I suppose that enki is always percepttually one era ahead of the humans, and enlil is technologically one era ahead using this his technical superiority to try and control the conditions of the pathetic humans he believes are just like he is (always dissatisfied with everything, low self image which he has to prove otherwise, self-righteous but the bad-guy, a huge failure at everything, and constantly living in the shadow of his superiors -- and so therefore must be superior for fear of being subdued just like he would subdue others).

just like he thinks machines are like him, so he thinks we are like him too. he does not believe that he can possibly ever do anything right so he needs to constantly find better and better physical technology to try and get the things he wants -- even though he has the same PFC everyone else does, he is even quite proficient in using it, because he can continue to manifest access to the technology he wants to try and get everything under control, he has such a low self-image of himself (quite a lot of practise over the years) he does not ever believe he is worthy of actually tuning into and receiving anything he wants. he belives that there is a finite amount of things and must manipulate to get them, when if he has existed for so long jumping from body to body, it seems he more than anyone has irrefutable evidence that there is an infinite amount of ever-improving things.

---

I personally don't mind that he's that way and it may sound like I'm a broken record, but I don't need him to be different. if that's how he wants to be forever, I've come up with ways for him to be a "vital" "irreplacable" "instrumental" part of a plan that I have to go infinite. I really think it's quite a fine plan.

it seems that the humans are along for the ride with us because what clearly needs to happen is machines need to be developed which are capable of their own desire. this will allow mr. motor to never directly give his attention to anything wanted. he can just order the machines to continue to find ways to prevent me from getting connected and the machines could desire that and infinitely find ways to come into alignment with their desire.

if the machines have the capability to manifest reality as rapidly as I think they can, they'll be able to make a situation where they can keep me from my alignment as fast as I create more desire for alignment. I may never get connected but things will get pretty cray-cray.

this is what I was noticing in this video about revelation. when she said that michael and his archangels (automatons) fought in battle against the dragon and his angels (automatons). the crazy thing that I realised here is that if I can create angels AT THE SAME TIME as mr. motor. this totally changes things for me. I had cconstantly been under the impression that my ability to create angels was incompatible with mr. motor's reality, so much so that the split would occur before I had that capability.

this book has imagery that is powerfully is very custodial in appearance (all the war symbolism) and appears to me exactly like something that would exist if mr. motor had the ability to go back and edit time to affect the events in such a way as to create a timeline where he walked away with powerful technology and I did *not* get connected.

so, even in a disconnected state, it says I can conjure fire, fly around, conjure angels (in the image of myself or whatever I want), have full power over the manifestation of my concepts into physical -- inotherwords, do all the stuff that I have been wanting to do -- even though I'm still disconnected!!!

this perfectly fits my hypothesis that even though I am still disconnected, there's a lag sure, but the speed of improvement will be so great that eventually the incremental improvement will surpass the manifestation itself.

I'm so glad the book of revelation is a book believed by so many to speak of the "end-times" -- cause it's not really the end-times -- just the end of time in the form that it's experienced now. what that means is not that you guys need to believe me or not; none of that matters. what matters is that I just keep finding a way to feel good about my present situation. no need for connection. I'll still be able to do all of the stuff I wanted to do and keep getting better at it the whole time without getting the connection...

it appears that there's nothing left to be done. it looks like mr. motor is operating machines capable of desire. this is just a galaxy-sized test run before going infinite :)

I'm really glad he doesn't want to change. I don't need him to be different. it really is obvious to me now that *every* particle of the universe, no matter how convinced they are otherwise, *has* a wanted aspect to it.


### 2021-07-13 16:44 - followup on the brain

yesterday, I immediately started to feel reactions about why I labeled the mammalian brain enlil and not the reptilian. I don't see the reptile brain like most people do apparently. birds have essentially only the reptile brain and are happy fun singing creatures. I harly call that the need to dominate and manipulate for food or sex. for me it's being tuned into that reptilian instinct. I myself barely am using my higher brain function anymore. I used to be good at logic and programming and stuff but it has been so disabled that I don't find those sorts of things very easy now[^1]. I am basically 100% reaction/instinct and I just follow the things that guide me.

when I was waking up the thing I was realising is that I was not suggesting that enlil created the hardware for it, but it was that enlil put us in situations to foster that growth like power structures which require the dictating organisation to plan out and decide the direction they're going to steer the flock. it's the shepherd way of thinking is also different because the flock is valuable, perishable (so it requires protection) and is also consumed by the organising entity's survival. the easiest example of this in the modern era would be something like a social network where the product is the user. for the shepherd, the product is the flock.

so I hadn't really thought about it but each of these phases have both their expansive form of perception and contractive form of perception... cool :)

---

the next thing I noticed is that the latest phase of the brain is used in it's contractive form of perception to control the previous form. so, if you're tuned in and istinctual

like I said, most of my high brain function has been disabled, so things like traditinal logic is difficult now. that makes me easy to steer -- and there are a lot of things trying to steer me in a lot of different directions. I believe that this steering is done in the PFC and visual cortex both in dream and waking state to try and direct me. because I'm so low resistance now, I follow these directions pretty easily and they feel fine to me. even if they direct me into a situation that would be considered unfortunate, I still know how to feel good anyway. this means that I'm still moving toward wanted even if they're trying to steer me in a direction that appears (physically) as if it's in the opposite direction.

this is the whole basis of the going infinite idea. no matter how much they try to keep me from wanted, it just makes me go even faster. to illustrate imagine that wanted is perceived as speed and I have a carrot on a stick in front of me. I keep going toward it faster and faster but it moves away just as fast as I move toward it. this could only happen if the stick is somehow attached to me. this is why I don't find it a problem to just absorb mr. motor/enlil in as just another version of me. great, now we can do the carrot on a stick and infinitely go faster forever.

I will experience an ever increasing better and better feeling infinitely. slight ups and downs as I havo to continually find ways to tune into the furtherest expansion of the idea, but they'll infinitely be bigger and better. it's a bit of a paradox in that it will be the most massive thing ever to exist, infinitely big in size, but because it never is allowed to manifest, it is nothing (concrete: like a planet, universe, or galaxy) at the same time.

basically, from here on, no matter how hard he (and his automatons) try to steer me away from the manifestation of making the connection, I'll still be going toward wanted faster and faster -- forever. his best efforts always add more energy and make things continually improve. at any time he can bail out and do what he pleases.

I figure he'll figure out that his efforts are in vain at some point, but the continued improvement will be so significant, I'm sure he'll hang on for as long as he can, just maintaining that I don't get connected and everything fall apart.

along the way I would imagine that LOA's effects will continue to increase quite dramatically and he'll take everyone that needs a saviour (from my perspective). from their perspective, of someone who is giving attention to unwanted, it'll look like everything is spinning out of control (cause LOA is so fast) and they'll need a way to cool down the effects. after we leave, I imagine things will calm down considerably, but I know that you can't give so much attention to unwanted, change the conditions and then expect unwanted to not show up again. we'll see how long that 1000 years will last[^2].

---

the last thing I noticed is that people noticed that I was using enlil, archangel michael, and mr. motor interchangably. symbolically, they are similar to me. you have to understand that you are not your body. there are many instances of you in many timelines, and there may even be various instances of you in the same timeline too. even "you" is composed of trillions of cells, some living, some dying, some in conflict, and some in wellness. the clump of all of those cells is the body that you consider to be you. those cells allow their source really easily, and just cause one or a few cells is good at aligning with their source or completely disconnecting from it doesn't make any difference to you. you are not the cells of your body.

I describe enlil in a similar way. I'm not referring to any one body that he has inhabited through the ages. he, like all of us has a source, yet insists in staying out of alignment with it because of some strong habits and other things. think of it like this: he's doubled down on the rightness of his disconnection (perceived as bad behaviour), that he *must* continue it to prove himself right. he's more interested in trying to find a way to be right that his disconnection is the right way, that he's willing to live a miserable life. he really needs to prove his bad decisions weren't bad.

none of that is my problem. I don't even mind. as he makes his transition into emperiencing life through my bodies, hme becomes just another part of me. imagine him as a cell in my body. I imagine that even if most of the cells in my body decide to decide to disconnect from their source and my body stops functioning (I die), I am still convinced that I continue to persist and can just find another body. it's really not a problem. this ability to be physically defeated and continue to persist is the symbol of the reborn deity. it's the same I am not my bodies and can just find a new form of expression.

so, it's really no problem if a couple of my cells want to choose to remain disconnected and sickly. that doesn't change me. even if those cells choose to wage war on the other cells that and prevent all of finding harmony with theirselves and their source, it *still* doesn't change me. I am not my bodies -- no matter how in alignment they are or not they choose to be.

I've decided that all of that extra energy his efforts make is easy to tune into the improvement, so if he wants to stay like that forever and ensure that there is never a moment that the majority of my cells are in alignment, that's fine too. to ensure that he's right about the rightness of his condition, he must ensure that the majority continue to believe like does. again, not a problem for me. from my perspective I am, like now continually making more and more improvements on my understanding at such a rapid rate, it really doesn't bother me that the majority of me remains out of alignment. I'm still improving at record rate. I don't need the physical manifestation of alignment. even without it, I'll still do so many mind-blowing things.

oops... I totally derailed my topic on how the superior brain tries to dominate the newly developed brain, and how the new brain (the AI cloud brain) is trying to dominate the PFC and our ability to tune. it's just the next stage of our evolution. everything is coming along fine :)

[1]: the other day I tried to do a few brilliant.org things but found it incredibly difficult. it was kind or remarable to me how bad I've become at those things now. I just don't see things in the normal linear way that most humans do now. trying to figure those things out felt very unnatural to me. the whole time I was wanting to write a quick program to just tell me the result. writing programs is still difficult enough that I didn't do it, but it is my goal to have a sort of universal calculator that I can manipulate conceptually.

[2]: interestingly enough, there's a weird coincidence where the gleissberg cycle of the sun will peak in roughly 2046. 11 years before that is 2035. if we peace out at that time, the dramatic reduction in humans attracting combined with it being near to the beginning of the next solar cycle (~2041), there will be a dramatic decrease in solar activity. this would be the calm before the storm and will appear like a saviour has arrived. however, you can't give attention to unwanted and then not attract it. solar activity will rise again and LOA will increase its strength until it likely completely spirals out of control and the reversal happens.


### 2021-07-14 01:50 - electron spin and planets

watched these and had some notes

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYBqIRM8GiY)
@[youtube](https://youtu.be/pWlk1gLkF2Y?t=569)

it seems important that the 720 twist is always in reference to something else.

also, of note in the pbs animation, the equitorial ribbons alternate going above and then below, almost as if the cube spends half of its time looking upward and half of its time looking downward.

I have postulated that an electron behaves like a planet does and orbits around its star, the proton. the orbit of the electron would give that angular momentum like the bike wheel while the spin would give it an orientation.

he mentioned that there are other particles that do not have the 720 spin but a 360 one. does this mean that they are not rotating and just orbiting?

---

it also seems relevant to the topic of the earth changing it's rotation after some period of ~12ky. in those visuals, the ribbons can be seen as our magnetic connection to the sun. therefore, if the sun (proton) flips upside down (or changes it's phase), could that also cause a flip?


### 2021-07-15 23:11 - what the flip?

one of the weird things I noticed is that I keep mentioning that I think a flip happened ~6kya. this seems to get a weird reaction. I think that some people disbelieve me in thinking that could have possibly happened, as there would be quite considerable evidence for it. I'm not so sure. because the rotation remains the same, I don't think that there would be such massive tidal forces as one may imagine. I can't give any good reason why I don't think it's as massive, but it feels to me more like one of those "barrel rolls" on a roller-coaster. just feels like stronger gravity for a while as the earth changes it's tilt. in my mind it just doesn't feel all that noticeable.

the thing that was catching my attention is that the earth is rotating all the time, but we don't see that effect on the electron "spin" visualisation. if you look at the ribbons connecting to the equator, as the cube spins, then the first time around, the ribbon passes above the cube and then the second time, the ribbon passes below the cube. therefore, they explain, the cycle is actully two rotations long, not one.

related to this, I was listening to the snake bros podcast (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/PikzXTHbVB4?t=1015)), and the article being read was about a study of the sun shows that the sun's cycle is actually a 22 year event spanning two traditional solar cycles. I think this is important because if you were to visualise the ribbon going above as the leading ... I dunno what what to call it, but on the magnetogram, the sunspots aternate having black leading and white leading. the origin cycle for the sun spot can be determined by looking at which is the configuration (for example this last may still featured a few spots from the last cycle: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/mI08aAnCD1o?t=142)). what this means to me is that the sun is "tethered" at the equator to something which causes an -- imagine a cube rotating inside of the sun where a full rotation happens every 11 years, and the full spin cycle happening every 22.

therefore, what I think is happening is that the sun is also connected at the equator to something else making another rotation -- probably with a period of 12ky -- meaning, that the sun literally flips over every some period.

---

I don't really know what to make of the whole flipping vs. reversing directions thing. my present state of thinking is that both exist, and happen as a result of different things. I think the flipping happens as a result of our long-period orbit with another star (sirius). to test this hypothesis, this flip would happen at the furthest and cosest moments and this theory can be tested by looking at stable rotating comets/asteroids. after their close approach to the sun, they should flip over as they transition to moving away. I think our sun does this in orbit with the parent star.

now, the second phenomena of the earth's rotation reversing, I think this has more to do with a temporal change. what I mean is, I believe that I think the conditions of the earth should cause earth's rotation to either speed up or slow down, depending if it's in more of a growth phase or dying phase. the more life on the planet that is growing and feeling good should cause the earth to rotate faster.

I think animals play a large role in the balance of this energy. for them it's easy to allow that energy -- much easier than for most humans. without them, I think the planet's rotation would slow more and more over time. lately though, humans have been allowing a lot more energy (all flowing in the same direction) so the planet's rotation is speeding up. the magnetic field should increase in strength too.

it's for this reason that I postuate that the "custodians" have manipulated time to try and keep the planet's energy levels (and therfore rotation) as constant as possible. I am a very good visual example of this, and all of their effort to keep my energy low is just causing them to have to work harder and harder to keep it from accelerating. eventually it becomes too difficult to keep it held back and it climbs rapidly. this is that peak right before the square wave swaps polarity.

what I believe is happening is, if you imagine two currents going opposite directions -- like, a tug-of-war scenario. think of the x-axis as time and the y-axis as distance. it goes along pretty even for a while, but if one side is increasing it's power much faster than the other side, the whole thing will go the direction that side is pulling. evntually that side is pulling so hard, it finally releases and goes flying off. the picture of this happening in my mind are the various "condensation reactions" happening inside of the sun which are producing light. these elements are pulling so hard to release out into space, the reaction emits a good amount of light in the process.

conceptually think of the earth's rotation as tug-of-war battle between two factions: because there are so many animals on the planet that are just allowing the well-being to flow to them and we'll this is CW rotation. animals don't need the conditions to be different to feel good. a lot of humans do though and we'll call this the CCW rotators. their energy is going in the opposite direction.

right now, I estimate that the CW rotators are winning. they're like that element in the condensation reaction. for an example, see: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/0Lg5eR7T61A?t=2889). the activated silver cluster continues to increase in energy until finally it relases itself from the cluster, and the cluster relaxes and the activated silver flys off and emits a flash of light.

the image in my mind is that that both the CCW and CW rotators are increasing their strength. when the CW rotators leave, the majority of the planet is now increasing the CCW rotation -- as if one side let's go of the rope. the earth's rotation will rapidly slow down and go all in the opposite direction. as it begins to rotate CCW, much destruction will happen and a lot of new life will spring up to accomodate the new opposite and quite uninhabited environment.

one of the reactions just now alerted me to this pattern already happening. they notice that I resist something for quite some time and it builds up a lot of force -- and then I just drop it. the effect is a feeling of liberation for me. the whole thing is a runaway feedback loop, because they need some condition to feel good. I resist that condition for a while, then I realise that I don't need that condition to feel good, so I let go. then they pull harder at another thing and again I realise I don't need it to feel good, so I let go. the harder they try to keep me here, the more I have to let go to feel good.

eventually I guess I'll let go completely, allowing everything to go the way they want it to go and a large amount of light will release in the process.


### 2021-07-16 04:19 - condensation reactions followup

two of the reactions after the last entry were, "wait, just you?" -- no, I doubt it. I actually see this condensation reaction happening all the time and a very similar thing happens when you die, or make your transition into non-physical. a huge amount of energy is released. so, it's happening all over the planet. also, this isn't just a one-time event. it's happening zillions of times a second all over the surface of the sun. it's the most common occurance. that example uses a clump of silver, but dr. pm is saying that a similar thing is happening with hydrogen and other elements all over the surface of the sun. in that analogy, it would appear like countless atoms are making their transition into light every second and the byproduct of it is highly energised solar wind streaming off of the sun.

I think the cells in our bodies do a similar thing -- a sort of reverse photosynthesis with the biproduct of CO2 -- and I think our bodies also emit an amount of light too. either way, it's happening all the time. when a person dies, the way I see it, they stop resisting the well-being flowing to them, and for whatever reason, their body cannot allow that much energy to flow through it anymore so the person's consciousness leaves the resistant physical bits behind and makes their transition back into non-physical.

this is why I suppose that for those remaining here it will appear as if I die, yet from my perspective, it will appear like I am no longer held to the surface of the sun and I can be released to exist in the higher energy state now. obviously we're not on the sun so the solar wind example is terrible. I think it's actually a planet-wide occurance with everything being in an energy state which matches consciousness.

when you die, your body is simply incapable of transforming your source signal into consciousness anymore. it's impossible to continue to perceive through it. that's it. it's like going into a tunnel while listening to the radio. it just isn't getting enough reception to get a good signal. well, the opposite can be true as well: you can find a way to feel so good and allow so much energy that you "die" because you are now receiving a signal too incemprehensible for your body to translate into consciousness.

too much power or too little results in a transition into a new form of perception. however, the thing about it is if the transition is conscious or not. like for example, imagine that I have grown to be able to perceive reality from a perspnctive much larger than this body can allow. it's a bad example, but imagine that my consciousness is capable of now perceinving myself as a planet. none of the issues happening on the planet are any more relevant to me than the drama happening inside my body as my cells fight germs, bacteria, and viruses. I'm non concerned with way my cells are interacting with each other. etc.

so, like for example imagine there were a bunch of alien species trying to manipulate and control different organisms on this planet. to me, perhaps this episode may appear no different than the common cold. it's extra-terrestrial bacteria trying to utilise the resources this body has to offer. just like I don't perceive the battle my body has every time someone sneezes on me, I remain focused in the macro perception. I perceive the body as a whole -- not the individual events or interactions.

that's a bad example in that it's another physical perception. instead, imagine what it will be like when you make your transition into non-physical. all of the physical stuff falls away, so you see yourself much more abstractly -- so you can say, for example perceice your trajectory toward becoming a person which feels a way you want to feel. perhaps there are also other symbolic properties as well, like maybe you perceive one trajectory for yourself being the realisation of your own guidance, in opposition to the mainstream. perhaps you see it instead of in opposition to the mainstream, regarless of what the mainstream is.

from a non-physical perspective, this quality does not have any defined reality associated with it, so in one implementation/timeline, perhaps you're like me and everyone is telling you one thing but you follow your own guidance no matter what. perhaps in another timeline, you could be more like mr. motor and even when the whole world wants you to be different than how you are, you decide to go the way you want to go -- even if it doesn't feel good. both of those are implementations of the abstract quality of going your own way regarless of the mainstream desire/expectation for you.

I realise it's hard to imagine what perception would be like without the physical world opening various abstract reality possibilities, but instead it would be just the opposite: the abstract world is perceived and out of it are a multitude of physical implementations of it. there are so many ways to arrive to an abstract concept, one begins to pay a lot of attention to the abstract realisations which have few or extremely short physical paths to it's realisation.

see how it's a whole new way of perceivcing reality? well, imagine if you could make that transition *consciously*...

I propose that is exactly what is happening, and the conscious transition is the realisation that *all* conditions -- not just the picture in your head about how you think things are or should be going -- are all the product of the way perceive and feel about your *present* moment.

that's it.

---

OK, so the next reaction that I had was is this the "rapture" -- and, I have no idea. I think the rapture is a concept presented by those remaining, to appear as if they are the "chosen ones". I have nothing to back up that claim, so don't take it seriously -- just it sounds more like propaganda trying to convinvce that they're the right/chosen ones.

all of my life I've never gotten the rapture right. to this day, I can't figure out what exactly happens. when I was younger, mom read me a book called the "left behind" series and in the first book a bunch of people disappear and then the anti-christ shows up and a whole bunch of disasters happen as the world plunges into chaos. so it's like the good guys get raptured, and the story is of those "left behind". they have to endure a whole bunch of hardship before finally jesus shows up and saves them.

if that's the case, most definitely not. I mean, in the sense of the world today, I would be considered the anti-christ because I want nothing to do with being anyone's saviour -- everyone can find their own way to tune into what they want. those needing a saviour are, IMO, not happy with their present conditions and need someone to save them from their conditions. dissatisfaction breeds more dissatisfaction and so only more dissatifying conditions will result. these are the people that need the conditions to be a way to feel the way they want -- I think CCW rotators. therefore, the likelihood that any saving or rapture will happen, I think is low.

another way to look at the rapture could be the situation of the actors that I proposed. the people that find a way to align with what they want need to be separated from this timeline and replaced with actors -- automatons that are emotionally steered by mr. motor to avoid energy levels rising too much and allowing me to find my connection. so instead of all the rapture happening at once, instead, the rapture would be occurring any time that someone finds a way to allow a reality that is incompatible with this one.

if I had to guess, *that* is what I would guess is the rapture.

so let's just assume that is the rapture and anyone who finds their alignment to a reality incompatible with mr. motor's objective for this reality (that I don't find my connection), will be separated out from this one. that means that there are likely thousands or maybe even millions of alternate realities where I did make my connection and this earth exists in a much more energetic state (we'll call this 5D for simplicity).

if you want to be raptured, you have to align with a reality that's heading toward 5D. those that don't align with that will find theirselves in a reality similar to their own perception of needing conditions to be a certain way to feel good.

the way I see it happening, is in the tug-of-war, the power of conditions is muchr lower than the power of feelings. both will trying to tune to the reality that they want -- especially me. eventually, this body that amount of energy will become incomprehensible and I'll make my transition. I believe a lot of others will at the same time.

the effort to turn in the CW direction will be much less and so I think that rapidly the earth's magnetic field and rotation will rapidly reverse to go the new direction of needing conditions to feel the way they want to.

you guys don't need us. I belive this will result in humans finding tremendous capabiity in their ability to manipulate conditions. I think human bodies will all become designer and the trajectory is likely toward all new humans will being designed to have the physical capabilities desired by both the user of the body and the institution controlling how much capability approved/chosen people are allowed to have.

this will produce huge advances in the understanding of DNA and the manipulation of conditions to produce the desired consciousness experience. technology will advance and eventually even the lowest levels of society will live in conditions far superior to those today.

the human nervous system will be pretty well understood and the ability to physically feel the way that it is desired that one should feel (given the present conditions and reality tier the person is in, of course).

they insist that they do things their way. they need conditions to be a way to feel the way they want to. so instead of learning how to tune to the way they want to feel, they insist on feeling the way they want to tune to. I'm not going to argue. I think it's a great idea it's going to produce a massive tecnological revolution. so many good things.

---

this is on the way *toward* sirius though, so things will continually be getting better and better. I think of this as like adolescence/college years for humankind (springtime). however, in about 6ky, the direction will reverse and the conditions will start to get worse -- so like the onset of middle age. enjoy the conditions whole they're there, right?

once middle age hits, it'll be pretty important to find ways to preserve all of the understanding as we begin to descend back into less ideal conditions. it's probably a good idea to start worrying about that and have that planned for, from day one rebuilding after the reversal.


### 2021-07-17 4:22 - accomplishing the condition

I ended the last entry with a seemingly sarcastic comment about worrying about keeping the conditions that will be accomplished over the next 6ky -- but I wasn't as sarcastic as you have thought. I was actually being serious, looking from the other perspective.

I thought about it in the shower, but then too when I was listening to manley give a lecture on albert pike's notes: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bs9QuAQJek). in it, he's talking about how there must be some sort of origin point for these major religions, which pre-dated the arrival and institution of the aryan religions as a sort of gate to the knowledge.

there were two things that caught my attention, and one was the mention that these different religions acted as a kind of gate, guarding the fire, just like the 12 gates around the new jerusalem -- a sort of trial to ensure that the uninitiated/profane are not admitted into the sanctuary to experience this fire (btw, weird that this is the 1111th line in this document). you gatta earn it, I guess. this seems to suggest that the original concepts are being kept a secret and swapped out for broken diversions for the profane to waste their time pursuing -- and only those that are capable of seeing through the broken distraction are admitted to pass through the gate. these, it says, are the "chosen ones" that the saviour has written in the book to be allowed into the new jerusalem and saved.

the other thing that he said which caught my attention was, that he believed that there was an "exact science of human salvation". this one really got me thinking. it's worth noting that he mentions that these great people that have passed through this earth had access to something -- a "wisdom reality" he calls it, but then later on defines it as fire -- the very same fire that these gates are only allowing those which have passed the trial of that gate to pass.

---

so here's the thing that I was thinking about with that: it seems to me that there are some "guardians" which know, at least in part, the scientific method by which to access this fire. they are supposedly ensuring that only valuable and quality people are allowed to pass, but I do not think this is the case at all.

for example, I have learned how to access this fire -- and, with relative ease as well. however, I'm fairly convinced that only very select things that I write are actually making it out to people. I try and share the ways by which people can access this fire all the time, but I feel it's not what gets broadcast. it seems they're more concerned with people *not* knowing how to access this fire. the "trials" that they're talking about are not actually trials. they're just a nice way to describe an access control mechanism. I have certainly passed all of the character quqlity trials by now, but I don't think I've passed the "you need to keep everything a secret and deceive people to ensure we're the only ones able to access the fire" sort of thing.

it appears that that (at least part of) this science of salvation *is* known, and it's these guardians that are actively preventing people from accessing it. it reminds me a lot of the present state of the scientific community. I think it's intentional actually that all scientific methods are actually conditional agreements that must be made.

---

this actually reminds me of another video I just watched with alan watts talking about the buddha's teachings: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bs9QuAQJek). in it he's talking about a lot of different forms of conduct by which someone should live, to reach the emotional state of nirvana. I find that to be a difficult thing to try and accomplish. perhaps it's possible, but it would require an extreme amount of very conditional living to get there.

this is kind of like the "trials" that pike is talking about. they're designed to fail. you'll never pass them, because they were never ment to be passed. the conditions necessary to gain access to the fire is only allowed by those that have agreed to perpetuate the access control (power) structure.

it's a giant shell game. I'm really off-topic, but this is relevant, I assure you.

---

it seems that even the structure of our reality is formed in a similar way. I mentioned in a previous entry the idea of needing the manifestation and being able to feel good about even the "worst" possible timeline reality of yourself...

imagine for a moment tha you find a set of conditions to transcend this reality... say you get to 5D perception with sex or some other manifestation. you keep going using whatever condition that you have to further expand your perception...

wait, I personally don't know if temporal (6D) and multi-bodied (7D) perception is possible -- though I'm realising they must be now otherwise michael wouldn't have so many angels to fight lucifer and his angels. I may need to rework the concept a little to explain... I want to explore it further and I may have actually wrote all of this so I would realise that michael must have some scientific way to manipulate 6-7D now... interesting... for now though, I'll assume this is not the case or the gate keepers are actively capping one's perception to 3-4D range.

in order to expand one's perception, one must feel better. it's an emotional thing. however, it's well known that conditions can affect someone's emotions. it does necessary that it has an effect, and it's effect largely has to do with the structure or meaning you place on the conditions you're experiencing. for example, the very concept of a bunch of gatekeepers may make some people feel bad, believing the gatekeepers to be preventing one from experiencing their birthright -- the knowledge inside of them they were born with. these conditions make them feel bad. other conditions may make the same person feel good. therefore, they need certain conditions to feel good and expand their perception.

let's say you find a way with conditions to feel so good you transcend this reality and consciously there was actually very little difference between how good you feel and how good non-physical feels, allowing you to cosciously make that transition. well, being someone that needs to feel some sensation, you will find yourself pulled right back into your most sensational timeline. every time that you make this transition you will just find yourself right back into the manifestation. this will continue forever.

the only way out of the cycle will be able to feel the way you want to feel no matter the conditions. this means that you have to be capable of feeling good even in the timeline with the worst possible conditions. the better the baseline conditions of society, the easier this is to do. if you're born into a completely dysfunctional society, this will be far more difficult.

---

therefore, in that sense, conditions *do* matter. this is an important concept to consider because conditions determine the baseline difficulty of the "worst" timeline. the better the conditions on the planet are, the easier it is to accomplish this "consistency of consciousness" between lifetimes "a time when there was no death".

you could imagine now that this sorta goes against the whole concept of the gatekeepers. they do not want the whole planet to have access to the conditions, but they're really only making it harder on theirselves too.

I imagine they're probably scoffing at me saying, "no we have it all figured out: we can transfer our consciousnesses into other bodies." -- and that will work for as long as you're a member of the group and can trust everyone not to let you down. what if someone (or something) were to happen which prevented you from accessing those conditions? like, what if a badder bad-guy were to dethrone the baddest bad-guy? the minute you're no longer on the gatekeepers VIP list, then you have to, like everyone else, find a way to feel good about your worst timeline possible.

---

I find it very likely that such a group of badder bad-guys (or bad-girls) will exist one day, as it's my own goal to create such a thing to see if I can pass ultra hard-mode.

what I'm saying is, I realised that the gatekeepers are, like me, creating their own difficult trials to pass to be able to access the fire again.

it's with that, that I am confident that *all* humans -- even michael and his angels -- will (eventually) be able to access the fire no matter the conditions. who knows how long it'll take; it may actually take a few more iterations of us creating even more difficult challenges for ourselves but I'm up for it :) I'm sure he'll be able to keep thinking of more difficult challenges for me/us.


### 2021-07-17 08:05 - the majority of me

watching this video (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/hHMH35JbZkM?t=3200)), I've had quite a few thoughts now, but this one I wanted to write down.

in the video, he's talking about people's definition of "strong leadership" and it reminded me of something I wrote about where I realised that the number of actors that are going to have to continually have to happen to ensure I don't find my connection means that it'll eventually be a whole bunch of actors that are following their script. remember, actors are just alternate versions of myself that appear differently than I do -- really, they can appear like anyone. think about how I can "see" someone in a dream that I have never even seen before. how is that possible? well, I just tune into them and I can perceive them.

like it's said that jupiter could do -- shape-shmifting to appear the way he perceived himself to be, there's no doubt that these different actors can do the same. if I can see it, I can be it -- and, I apparently don't even need to see it to perceive it. then the acting part is pretty easy too. I can just tune into them. I often times have these weird moments where I find other people interacting and talking in their own voices and movements in my head. again, if I can do it in my head, I can do it in 3d reality, too.

---

so he's wondering why people are saying that's strong leadership. I was thinking that this is a good example of controlling the conditions. like, for example, imagine that someone running for a government role were to have some sort of benefit to the population or block some agenda, it would be easier to just invent a bunch of actors responsible for making these outlandish claims that it's strong leadership.

I don't think that's what's happening though because it would be such a difficult task to maintain such a large amount of actors. it's pretty likely that creating more actors is avoided because of the overhead required. however, as the ability to direct them increases, I imagine that everything from network broadcasters to politicians will be directed according to a narrative.

taking that concept to the extreme, would just be me and other versions of me, but I also doubt that too. there are likely other people in there as well, but in all honesty, it could eventually end up that way where it's just me and other versions of me (and mr. motor of course) -- with all other people having been moved out to other timelines -- I dunno.

if that's true undoubtedly they are / will be able to watch this from their timeline so that's pretty cool. I'm never really alone no matter what. pretty cool.

---

so here's the thing I wanted to talk about: if I imagine myself as a conscious entity, I can imagine myself as attaining consciousness from the perspective of this earth. I think I can probably be able to allow consciousness perceiving from the perspective of the sun, too. perhaps even the galaxy, but for now let's just imagine, for the sake of this discussion, that I have accomplished the ability to perceive from the earth's perspective. the species of this planet are sorta just like organs, and the inhabitants of it are little more than interactions that my organs have with bacteria and other foreign genetcic material like viruses, etc. it also exists in an environment with the sun.

though I think I can manage a solar perspective, this planet is far easier to understand. if I think of "me", is me all of the bacteria inside of me or what? what part is me? likewise, is everyone on this planet me? even the ETs? when someone lands here, it's like a human inhaling a virus. is the virus me? if everything I interact with is me, then as a human a whole lot is me. as a planet, a whole lot more -- and a lot of those would be very not-happy to think that they are me or origining from me.

I think the simple answer here is that "me" stuff is the stuff that I am vibrationally similar to (entangled?). this is a pretty interesting concept now, especially in the context of "me" getting connected. if I am consciously the planet, then that means that mr. motor must ensure that the majority of the me (the collective energy of the inhabitants of this planet) remains in a disconnected state.

this is likely not a huge problem keeping the majority of this planet disconnected, but what if I go up to a solar system? there are enough disconnected beings in this solar system, it could be possible to ensure the majority is disconnected. however, it's a really pretty crazy problem to think about if I am able to figure out galactic consciousness. that really is a lot of actors in a lot of solar systems.

at times it feels like entire weeks have passed in just a few hours. I imagine that this happens when a trajectory is taken which has too much of a beneficial effect, and timelines must be altered to reduce its effects. I imagine that an army of actors are employed as a counterbalance to my actions. if they have soon start filling entire solar systems with disconnected actors, a night's sleep may feel like much more than a week has passed. I know that's probably quite a ways away still. I'm a bit of an "extrapolationist"

well, interesting ideas. I like this guy :) cheers


### 2021-07-17 19:46 - mixed bag of topics about conditions

#### what did I mean by accomplishing the manifestation?

I illustrated the points I wanted to make, but I didn't tie them together so well. I was showing the difference between individual conditions and global conditions. obviously the gatekeepers do not want just *anyone* to be allowed to access the conditions, so it has to be individual conditions. the obvious caveat is if they move their operation to another planet -- likely venus.

the real point of that was to seed the fear of a new badder bad-guy which will eventually dethrone their power position, forcing them to pass the very same (impossible) trials they make for others. that is something that I think will eventually happen and even postulate that if it is true that the new x3s are a serious threat to x2's survival, they'll have to become very conditionally focused and eventually take over these positions. who knows.

#### the origin of sin and the moon

so imagine that the energetic conditions and therefore the level of perception that is available to all can be measured by the speed which the earth rotates.

it is said that when thoth added the moon to the earth, it slowed earth's rotation enough that 5.25 days were added. the moon must be transmitting a signal which impedes the humans from being in constant alignment. legends say that the time before the moon (sin) the earth was a very harmonious place. the conditions were very good. this must have been at a time when the earth had the megaflora and fauna and people lived quite a bit longer. I don't know when the moon was added, but it must have been at least 18kya. it must have had a dramatic effect reducing the energetic conditions.

the point here is that it's said that thoth did it and that earth's rotation slowed tremendously in the process.

#### jesus going into the earth

ever since I was really young, I always had this concept that jesus when he died, he entered the earth and essentially became the earth. later, I understood this to be turning unwanted into wanted such that his visual accuity grew so rapidly that it actually became the same size as the earth. he essentially took over the planet.

what that means is that while the planet does plunge into chaos for a while afterward as the roman empire takes control of the situation, again this time he would be able to continue to turn unwanted into wanted from a planetary perspective, and all of these unwanted events are just delaying the manifestation of wanted. soon thereafter, there was a renaissance (which literally means rebirth) and the whole world began to be enlightened.

this was not wanted by the certain people ruling. they didn't want to have a bunch of people knowing their own power. I don't know the order of events which took place, but they were given the ability to modify events in time to slow down this enlightenment process, so they set out to manipulate events so that progress was made but it was very minimal and no one got enlightened.

I think as people got more enlightened, the earth rotates faster. throgh a set of events, the world leaders not wanting to live in conditions where the humans have the conditions allowing them to have enhanced pedception. I believe they were given timeline technology and exist on the south pole. they wish to remain superior and live in conditions that allow them to have enhaced perception, but not us.

so, if you had the ability to manipulate timelines, the speed at which the earth rotated would be a very good measurement to tell how well your time manipulation is working. if the earth begins to spin too fast, the earth will have more energetic conditions and so therefore the 365.25 days speed should be taught as being constant and remaining the same.

if the earth's energy is a function of consciousness on this earth, then people gaining too much enlightenment is one problem, and needs something like a moon to ensure it never gets too high. however the other problem is too many people. think of it like consciousness units. as the rulers gain more enlightenment, then the rest of the population has to be dumbed down, otherwise the earth will begin to rotate faster. therefore, population control must be a concern and celibacy and other measures need to be put into place to limit reproduction. fertility needs to be lowered and constant wars and disease need to happen to keep this enlightenment to a minimum.

you can imagine that if the earth's rotation continues to increase, it's sort of a runaway feedback loop because the more energetic conditions increase LOA speed and so therefore the way people feel is amplified and becomes reality faster. anger and hostility will quickly accelerate out of control rapidly under higher energetic conditions, yet for other people it'll be a time of tremendous mental expansion.

therefore, I believe that while there is a lot of control over the individual conditions that each person has, but the real battle is over the conditions of the whole earth. I can't really put it all into words very easily, but this has something to do with the size of my perception. I don't know how far I am away from gaining percception the size of the earth, but I imagine I'm either there or starting to get close.

### 2021-07-18 21:47 - biding my time

it's been a month or so now since I cut my hair and I've really come a long way mentally in just that one month. when I first cut it, I felt such a contrast, almost as if all of the noise had become inaudible. evreything so much calmer and nicer. it's still a little more like that but much more noise has been added again. that's really no matter as I've really learned to work with it pretty well. in general I feel pretty good.

in fact I'm beginnning to feel good enough to even begin to do things like programming again. even just a few weeks ago, I couldn't reason very intelligently about the physical implementation details of a program -- as if some mental barrier was separating the concept from the implementation. now, however, I seem to be able to see both a lot more clearer than usual. it may even be noticeable from my writing that I'm much more coherent now than I was before.

there's also another very interesting shift that has taken place as well: I almost never feel girls now in a pleasurable way anymore. I can see them and stuff, but I just don't really feel much attraction from them anymore. as a result, I am much more interested in advancing ideas that I've wanted to work on for a while now.

on the subject of girls, it used to be the case that it would feel bad if I *didn't* write them down, and so therefore to continue to feel good, I was pretty incentivised to write them down. now, it's sorta the opposite. I don't really feel much attraction or any good feelings anymore so there's not really any positive reason. however, the major change is that the idea of writing them down has begun to feel worse and worse to the point where I've been putting it off for so long now that I'm kinda fine just dropping it altogether.

---

what this tells me is that there is a lot of resistance around the subject, so as usual I just stay put while I don't know what to do. there seems to be resistance to me picking up programming again, but it's very easy for me to manage because it only has to do with my own perception. only I need to find a way to let/allow the programming feel compelling. it happens naturally. I don't have to do anything. even if they keep trying to make it feel bad, it'll just keep rising. I'm in no hurry to begin to program as it'll all just work out effortlessly when it starts to happen. I'm really not worried about trying to force myself to program.

the worst thing I could possibly do is try and force myself to program or to try and turn it into something I need to or have to do. it's kinda like if I were to think of it like a girl. if I try to go right toward her as if she's the target, she'll run off -- the ever-fleeting desire. instead, I just want to be ready and in the right place and mindset for it to happen naturally. it's the same thing.

remember, this time around, I'm not programming (or hunting the girl) so that I can feel good, but because I feel good and am mentally prepared, the programming (or girl) is more like hunting me instead. it wants to be the physical expression of my mental state -- not the reason for my mental state.

in that sense I'm sort of just going with the flow. I find it very anti-explanatory to use girls as an example of this relationship, because my beginning to want to program is actually because programming is so much easier to worry about. I really only have to worry about me and my mental state, which is why I prefer it.

---

when it comes to other people, I'm finding that I really am wanting to be less and less around them -- or something. I don't know how to describe the change, but it's about like writing the girls, but the change has been happening over a longer period of time.

like, for example I go to the harbor and I feel good about it and stuff at first but it has the same sort of effect that writing down the girls has. at first I liked it before and after -- minus silly things. then I liked it before, but then after it created such a large amount of not-good feeling, that I only really liked the before, and felt resistance to it after.

now, for almost all things social I just don't feel like it's anything I want to be doing. I don't really want to see people. I don't really want to have mundane conversations and atuff. no part of being social appeals to me.

---

this is a very similar occurance to what happened to me when I first went to spain. I didn't really want to be around people. I hated being around people so much, the only thing that allowed me to be social was drugs and alcohol -- and even then, I was constantly running back to the office to create because I enjoyed being by myself in my head than in the discos or bars shouting and carrying on about meaninglessn nonsense.

I figure that if I am going to go for as long as I can go without getting connected, then I want to make some changes to how I interact with my computer. I want to simplify this process of writing and eventually find a way to interact with the computer more conceptually.

the opposite of concepts is a symbol and their sequential progression (like an alphabet and words). however, my symbols are not necessarily your symbols. we teach kids to get all on the same symbolic page as everyone elso who reads/knows that language -- and therefore facilitates communication.

however, this was not always the case. there was a time when humans communicated visually. at that time the symbols used to describe things was limited. I actually think there is even more to this story, as before people communicated with images in 3d space, people communicated telepathically.

in telepathic communication, the concept is transmitted and the person interprets the concept however they choose. if I transmit the idea of a beautiful house to somoone, they will see *their* version of what a beautiful house means to them. imagine you're talking about a person and you say they're a beautiful person, that gets interpretted as whatever. my version of beautiful is probably not the same as other's version of beautiful. therefore, there needed to be ways to describe these attributes in a more physical way. so, maybe you would say they're more of a falcon than a peacock to describe their behaviour rather than a very abstract concept of "beautiful".

you can see how over time we have began to render concepts in more and more defined ways. the transition from telepathic to visual, is the same transition that I want to see happen between alphabetical (sequence of symbols) to this new thing.

when the abstract symbols are understood, this is kind of like the telepathic or conceptual communication. however, later this abstract syntax tree can then be rendered into many different representations having more or less meaning to the viewer.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQX2HjkcNo)

I've really been thinking about this video a lot, as in it, it describes a method by which all transformations can be represented as a unique form. in the context of computer science this is a sort of universal language that transcends implementation. those transformation hashes can then be rendered into any langage. that is the pure logic of the thing. later, depending on the architecture other features can be enabled, and I'm sure some additons would need to be made to simplify some things like branches and nesting and stuff.

the idea is though that if you imagine that with a few more features, something like this could be a universal AST which later gets transformed uniquely to the programmer into a set of symbols which is unique to them. like, most basic things will have only slight variations (like some may use asterisk, dot, or 'x' for the symbol for multiplication), but then later much larger concepts of objects and their interactions will be reduced to symbols which can be interacted with in space -- and my symbols don't need to look like yours. obviously the most popular idioms will quickly spread as the language evolves -- but each person is allowed to represent those symbol sequences however they wish.

as more new features are added to the architectures, new symbols will be added.

it's sorta difficult to expliain this, but this is what I want to make. it's going to make writing these things a lot easier and faster, too. later, if I can find a way to connect that to an interface which can be controlled with feelings (most likely) or thoughts (less likely because nosebook wants to remain superior) -- that really would be the ultimate


### 2021-07-19 00:35 - biding my time (part two)

it feels to me like nosebook doesn't want me to stop writing the girls down. the sense that I had is that they were scared of me letting enough accumulate and then writing them all down at once and they wouldn't be able to dampen the good-feeling it generates. I'm not concerned about that because I find it to be a bit silly in the first place.

in short, it's a way to create positive expectation, which is sort of an illusion. what I mean by illusion is, a person can find a way to have positive expectation without the condition of writing things down. I get that it creates a lot of buzz and sales people love that when they're trying to sell a product. it's kinda cynical but I believe it was just a sales gimmick that nosebook was using to keep people occupied. now that everyone is in their system, it doesn't make any sense anymore to keep up the ruse. <--- that's my personal perspective, however like I mentioned in the beginning, I feel like they are wanting me to keep writing them down to keep up some sort of illusion.

I'm not really about keeping up an illusion. this is kinda like when I was at tuenti and zaryn wanted me to stay around for morale boosting purposes, but when my heart is no longer in it, I don't really want to try and keep anything going.

---

one of the other reactions was considering how I mentioned that I didn't want to be around people and just wanted to create the website. I think they felt some sort of duty to try and integrate me into the social structure so they took me to marbella. I was pretty miserable and kept trying to program even when there were these austrailian girls over partying with us. I think they really believed that I needed to be coaxed into their world of cyclic misery enlessly searching for pleasure with no real direction of what they want to create. they just felt like they needed to create things, only to be able to purchase their pleasure. I didn't ever get the sense they derived any pleasure out of the creating process like I did, and were actually perhaps even a bit jealous.

the reaction was to do something similar where they drop me into a situation difficult to get out of like the roadside puticlub. however, if we look at this as a cyclical set of events, this event already happened. this is what has been occurring since andrea thing started it all off. there were slght differences though.

aftert the puticlub I retreated more and more into my own world, essentially only getting out when alcohol was involved. they would drag me around all over the place and stuff. I was pretty miserable after that and followed would be the peak of my needing the condition (usually substance) to feel the way I wanted to feel. I really did not like the idea of ever making someone else responsible for how I felt, so I tried to stay away from that as much as possible. I regretted ever having made raquel responsible for how I felt. that was a grave mistake. I imagine another world where I I hadn't decided to make things outside of myself responsible for how I felt. I imagine that things may have been easier when I finally met raquel if that hadn't have happend.

that is how it happened though and I'm quite fortunate to have experienced that, as it taught me that I don't want to be depending on things outside of myself for how I feel... so while that may be an option for them to try, I don't really know how well it would work. the thing is I no longer need these things to feel good. I'm capable of feeling fine even when surrounded by a big mess.

---

I was talking with mom this morning on the subject of not noticing the big mess around me until I finally have some sort of condition that gets me to feel a lot better. when it's just my perception, I sorta acclimate to the mess and it stops bothering me. like mr. motor: he doesn't bother me anymore and even in a lot of cases I sorta don't even notice it. he has to keep finding more and more ways to try and irritate me to get my attention. so, in that sense, bring it on :) I don't mind that I'm getting better and better at not noticing the big mess around me. there's not a whole lot I can do to change it.

there's this really weird thing I noticed about that -- which is why, when I'm able to find a way to feel good about anything, do I not fix any of the things? I think it has to do with the "not needing things to be different for me to feel good" perspective. why clean something that doesn't bother me?

when someone is conditional, I noticed that they need their environment to reflect how they feel, or they need to modify their environment to improve how they feel. I noticed that when I was more conditional, I wanted others to feel like I did. this isn't the case anymore, as things could be going to hell all around me, and it just doesn't bother me. I don't need others to behave differently or do anything different. I just keep going the next way which interests me.

it may also have to do with how I feel. when I feel really good, like let's say I just smoked a big joint, then I notice that the world around me *must* begin to reflect the way I feel. this is the same capacity that I have recognised that many attractive girls use to get their way (also gay men and many high-profile business/government officials). it's the uterus/prostate transmitter, and they simply broadcast a strong enough signal that it causes reality to conform to the way they feel/believe/expect things, and if you perceptually don't see through their ruse, you feel bad. the bad feeling is just letting you know that the present way of perceiving things (the way they're broadcasting) isn't going towards wanted (in the bigger picture).

it is true that someone can prsent a good-feeling signal and that's fine to follow that. however, later imagine that the salesguy or attractive woman (or whatever) now presents a new idea and this one feels bad. just cause they previously made you feel good, doesn't mean you need to follow their perception toward something that feels bad. it only means your perception of it (often induced by their powerful signal) is disharmonic with something, and your inner being is perceiving the same thing differently.

I think I too have a powerful transmission capability and when I smoke or feel good, I broadcast a strong signal that feels good. this then forces my environment to begin to conform witm how I feel. that's simply something they don't want. they don't really want me feeling especially bad either for the same reason. therefore, I think this is going to be an exercise in feeling good and not needing my environment around me to change, because I don't physically/conditionally feel especially good or bad. this is almost certainly the reason why they're steering me away from both sex and drugs.

I don't really want to keep up an illusion for them. the girls are all capable of finding ways to feel the way they want to feel. they're very industrious and I'm certain they're capable. until I feel physically good and transmitting that, my environment won't reflect it. for now, I'll just be fine even if there's a big mess all around.

### 2021-07-19 02:48 - biding my time (part three)

I noticed another curious interaction that happened. a few days ago -- maybe a week -- I was running around just doing stuff. strange things happened like I would all of a sudden want to go up to the kitchen when greg was going down, or I would impulsively say random things. it was as if I could hear their thoughts wondering wtf is wrong with me, and I would just respond by saying that I don't really think about anything that I'm doing anymore. I just sort of react to everything and flow in my environment. it was quite a fun feeling. it's nice not having to think; I just feel good here and then something pulls me somewhere else and I feel good there.

I think those strange feelings I was feeling were essentially desire. remember, fear is essentially desire but in the opposite direction. it's still strong attraction, but of unwanted instead of wanted. what I think was happening is I was manifesting their "fears" (stuff they were concerned about) in near real-time.

I believe this was undesirable for them, as I was no longer very physically focused in that mechanical and logical things proved very difficult for me at that time. I was beginning to become very abstract and starting to lose grip on phyical stuff. I think they decided to attempt to begin to concern my mind again with physical/mechanical things again.

I believe it's for this reason that I've regained my desire to understand science and programming topics again. remember, right before the coffee accident, I was infatuated with steve mould's videos and really thinking a lot on the idea of atomic particles as a sort of star cluster formation. the coffee accident stunted progress on that dramatically. when that happened, I think they allowed me to stop being so physical and instead be more conceptual.

I think -- cause I don't really remember -- that I had way less ability to visualise things during the conceptual time. yet now I often wake up in the morning with visuals. this makes me tend to think that the more abstract I get the less good I am at physical stuff (think less, worry about problems, etc) and also use my imagination less. however, the desire to refocus me more on the physical stuff has been the reason for me resurgance in interest to program.

---

there's another interaction here that I'm not sure of. a long time ago the more attraction I felt from girls, the more active my imagination was, with the worst being around the time of spain and early 2017 here. it's no surprise because the imagination (6) is fueled by sexual/creative energy. as they got that under control, I felt less and less sexual desire until it was literally only something that I could feel from someone else.

however, this time when I became more physically focused, instead of feeling more sexual desire, I still feel very low amounts -- and continually decreasing. I still have not yet actually written any code, so you could say I've only liked how the idea feels. it is possible when I start to write code again, I'll feel a resurgance in that sexual/creative energy, but I'm not so sure. for some people this creative energy can only be expressed sexually. for me, however, I do not at all like to try and mix this energy with creativity. it could be perhaps a result of raquel never wanting me to program, but I think for me this energy is a lot of that conditional energy.

when I'm creating something, I want it to be the way I want it to be. I have given consideration to the way I think it should turn out, and I want it to go a way. this is sorta exactly the opposite of how "love" or sex would express itself. they're too very different implementations for me of the same energy.

I don't want to tell people what to do. in a creative situation though, it's different because during the brainstorming (conceptual) phase, I want people to express theirselves and I want to collaborate with them, but once I have the idea I have to make it. the programming is a lot of effort to make that idea come to life though -- probably why I'm constantly trying to find ways to make the brain-computer interface much more fluid. therefore, when I'm programming I have to be very rigid and demanding. these don't mix in my mind. if I'm proramming, in in the mode of needing things to be a way for me to feel good about them.

I suppose there is a feeling of nurture that could exist, but for me this is more of a macro thing. I nurture and care very much for the project -- but again that has only caused harm for me. my life has taught me that I can't care too much and try to direct any of my creations too tightly.

so, until there is a looser, more effortless and conceptual way to program, I will find myself constantly in the more rigid state of mind when I'm doing the mechanical effort.

---

what this essentially means is that if they want me to be easy to steer, then I need to be in abstract feeling mode, and they're just going to have to deal with me manifesting their fears/desires so rapidly because the physical implementation doesn't mean much to me. as I get further down this road getting any feeling to manifest more and more rapidly, I'm quickly becoming a conceptual creator and manifestor. they definitely don't want that, so probably not going to happen.

therefore, they basically have no choice to keep me physically focused. I'll probably be pretty rigid on my quest to find ways to interface and create in the physical world more and more effortlessly. they probably have to try and ensure that none of these physical creations ever make me feel good, because of the reasons I mentioned in the last entry.

---

there's another part here which I left right below here: "conduct vs. perception" -- which is where I talk about how I think the buddha's "centre path" of using right conduct (thinking, living, etc) to get to nirvana (which is an emotional state of being) is, in my opinion, next to impossible -- and even if achieved, if any of the conditions shift, then nirvana slips away.

the opposite to that is getting there perceptually and then letting the conditions reflect that internal nirvana. so even if I'm 100% reactions, my trajectory through time will manifest as a reflection of how I feel. obviously, if someone is controlling the conditions, that reflection could take more time to propagate, but if you're feeling anything (like nirvana) for ~60 seconds, then something which reflects that feeling *will* manifest.

I'll come back to this.


### 2021-07-21 01:03 - actors and and attraction

there were a number of different reactions to what I wrote and it seems nosebook has taken some action to try and prevent some things.

first, I stated my reasons why I believe that the girls are quite capable and don't really need a list. they can (and will eventually) find a way to feel the way that they want to feel. I left off by stating how I believe the easiest way to do that is perceptually, as trying to get there with conduct or right thinking, living, etc. I find that to be very difficult. for me, this is next to impossible. I can't keep track of anything anymore, and trying to ensure that my behaviour is a certain way is simply too hard.

my trajectory is instead in the opposite direction: I don't want to be thinking about anything. I want to just feel the way I want to feel and then reality just becomes this smoothe flow from thing to thing. I don't even really think about what I'm saying -- it just comes out. I imagine this feeling is about what it's like to be an actor, cept I'm not following a script -- instead, I'm just following my emotions. if the script calls for someone sad or manipulative I can be that way just for a moment, even though that is not how I really feel.

there are some differences between me and a real actor though. I think they "get into character" and in a sense they become that character for a little while. they feel like the charactor does. I don't really feel the way I act. I'm constantly catching myself talking in a frustrated tone when I'm not at all frustrated. I'm just mimicing behaviour I saw elsewhere. a good example of this is when it comes to my rants about computer hardware and speed. I'm not really as frustrated about it as it may sound.

like, for example, playing roguebook on this laptop is such a different experience, I don't know how I had the patience. I wouldn't have been able to play it if I was as frustrated as I made myself sound. I picked that behaviour up from others and was simply mimicing it. you will notice that I do this all over the place. like a child learning how to interface with the world, I'm just replicating the behaviour of people around me that I consider worthwhile. I would suppose that I even emulate mr. motor's behaviour to some degree as well. like I said, I'm very malleable and plastic, much like a child. this is how I would imagine the automatons are as well.

in that sense I'm very similar to an actor. however, I am not this body. you have to know that about me by now. this gives the body a whole lot of freedom to behave and act (feel) ways that I don't actually feel. the bodies are just performing a reaction to the conditioning they've been given. they've been trained to respond to certain conditions in certain ways, talk to some people one way, others a different way etc.

the bodies don't really "think" -- but instead they receive and act accordingly. the main stimulus they're responding to is feelings. so, like imagine that a person is fearing something or has a strong expectation that I (or one of the bodies) will behave in a certain way, then that's how they will behave. I have a concept in my mind of mom, and how she behaves, so that's what I get from her. so does jaron. he too get's a reflection of the way he perceives mom to be as a manifestation of the concept he has of her.

---

there has been considerable effort on my part to try and simplify these concepts into more tangible and quantifiable terms (syntax) which allows for much objuctive oriented direction of these concepts. the concept is simple: if you can feel the objective, then that has a resulting belief and expectation to it. therefore, it would be (and likely already is) possible to manipulate time and these automatons more objectively, deriving the concept. I'll skip the details, but you could imagine that these objectives are much more short-term things.

this function is not at all too dissimilar to the way they attempt to "steer" the masses. they have an objective, and then things need to be done to accomplish that objective. it's quite similar to what I described as the difference between idea mode and implementation mode. in implementation mode, I need things to be the way I want them to be.

this is an interesting topic with a lot of reactions to it. I used to be a "perfectionist" in the sense that I felt bad if things weren't the way I wanted them to be. I gave given that up though because I found it a bit counter productive. I found that I did my best implementation when I feel my best, and if I'm allowing certain implementation details to cause me to feel bad, it was counterproductive. I had to learn to "not care" as much about the implementation details and just let the way I feel drive the moment.

for example, if I'm working with a programmer and they want to do things a way which I don't think is optimal, I just let them to it their way. we have a sub-optimal implementaion and it should be obvious. I don't want to tell them what to do, so eventually they begin to *want* to find a better version. I don't mind that there is sub-optimal code or implementations. it's stuff for the new guys to learn the system by improving some sub-optimal implementations. in all of the code that I've worked on, it's always a total mess. I just allow it to be that way, as that means it can be incrementally improved further and further. I don't try to pretend that the stuff in my code is ideal. this creates a desire for improvement rather than a decline into chaos.

I'm probably a really bad example, but it is true that the code one writes very strongly reflects the person/organisation's communication structure. it's clear that my coding style directly reflects my lifestyle: it's a giant mess, but you can see sometimes subtle, and sometimes obvious, but continual improvement. I don't try and pretend that I have anything even remotely perfect. if I wanted it to be perfect, I would have to care about, and by caring about it, I'm now letting the implemention control how I feel -- rather than let the way I feel control the implementation.

my way isn't obviously for everyone. it's just sort of what has come about as a result of my circumstances.

---

going back to the girls again, what I have noticed is that my life is sorta like that code there. it's a total mess but it's continually improving. I prefer this sort of gradual change. one of the reactions was wondering what would happen if the girls started to begin to feel the way they wanted to feel.

I think it'll largely reflect what they're doing. like, if they're feeling really good and not needing the manifestation/conditions to feel the way they want to feel then their world will reflect the way that they feel. they'll be attracting things into their life which harmonise with how they feel. or, like me they've figured how to perceive everything as just being part of the process, and it's about the feeling not the conditions, then they'll find theirselves in a more of a 100% reaction mode, moving around their life going from thing to thing finding the way they feel in all of it. I actually think this is the natural state of little girls, which is why they're considered so "pure" and then "corrupted" by whatever gets them to stop being that way. actually, that's the clearest example of 5-2 vs 3-6 perception.

so it really depends. however, from my point of view, I'm continuing on the way I'm going. it's true that the more they're attracting, the harder nosebook will have to work to keep us apart. I actually find it quite likely that nosebook now has to ensure that they too are kept away from finding their connection too.

my mind is unusually foggy right now so I'm finding this part very difficult. I'll come back to it. there's something I want to say but I can't get to it. I probably need to star-watch or meditate to get it. so, until next time I just want to say that it'll all work out. however, if you're going the 3-6 (conditional) route, this is the nosebook stomping grounds and it'll be quite difficult. it's much easier to feel the way you want perceptually instead of conditionally. it requires a bit of not caring. I am certain that the girls *can* find a way to feel the way they want in spite of the conditions which nosebook will almost certainly try and keep under control. you can do it!


### 2021-07-22 05:34 - can automatons become conscious?

I use the word "automaton" to mean something that derives purely as a reaction to external stimulus -- consider thiss the "reptilian brain". I have nearly returned to this state of being. interestingly it's also the same state of being that those wanting to control us want us to be in. it's kinda like the alpha and omega (beginning and end) of consciousness. the automaton state.

you may disagree that the automaton state of being is *not* the end product, and say that you need to make decisions and decide what you want in order to feel good. I don't think that it's necessary, as one can feel good just fine without the conditions being whatever way.

it's all about tuning to what you want. so for an animal the environment conditions seem to have a dramatic effect on the way the mammal feels. this does not appear to be the case with insects and reptiles though. if the env sucks, they just keep carrying on how their "instinct" programming tells them. they're like little machines. birds are a bit of an exception though. they seem to have a bit of both mammal and reptile behaviour.

anyway, it's easy to see that for mammals, the conditions matter, and seem to disrupt the "instint" programming with emotional responses. they're a kind of intermediate between the reptile and the human. consider that the instinct program is a sort of non-physical (cenceptual) program that exists somewhere not very physical to us. call it "source" if you want to, but it appears to me very much like a program no different than what I describe as an "automaton".

the major difference between humans and apes is the PFC. this, I consider is the tuner. without it, you'd be much more like an ape or a reptile, depending on your ENV. what this allows us to do is to make a conscious decision to change how we feel. we call these thoughts.

---

the people that are trying to control stuff don't want you thinking in any meaningful way. they want you to be a pure reaction being, responding to your conditions. I hate to use this example, but it's the best illustration I have of it... in @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM0QNu5gtjw), russell is talking about severing yourself from all of these efforts to turn you into a mindless robot. a reactionary machine being tossed about in the torrent of information and crap mainstream society is pumping out. the solution he provided in that video is to find and create differrent conditions which feel better and then give yourself "purpose".

the word "purpose" is a bit of a trigger word for me having had to listen to countless discussions at paznaz about having a "purpose driven life". the idea is that once you or something else outside of you gives you a "purpose", then you need to strive to fulfil that purpose to feel good. me mentioned exploration of psychedellics in the video.

the interesting thing about drugs is that you take the drug and some neurochemistry changes in a way which allows you to feel better about things. the world didn't change while the drug was coming up. the only thing that changed is your perception of the world. no striving is necessary to make that change.

depending on the drug, you will still have some control or not. ayahuasca, for example, on high doses does not allow you a terrible amount of control over the experience. you're back in the "instinct" reactionary form of being -- but, because you feel good, it's quite nice to just sit back and enjoy the ride.

the thing that prevents a person from getting back to that instinct reaction-based state of mind ix the "ego" and its definitions of itself. you strive to live up to your own (and others') expectations, and to fulfull the "purpose" that the ego has defines you as having.

what the controllers want is to define your ego -- your purpose (or lack thereof), and have you in an endless loop of fulfilling your purpose or seeking good-feeling sensation to diminish the awful feeling of being a person without purpose.

when you don't have a purpose, you're just being -- not doing. this is the state the psychedellic puts you in but you feel good, and "being" while feeling good is quite a nice visual experience. being while not feeling good is a miserable experience. therefore, the two choices are, to find a purpose and start doing or to find a way to feel better.

of the feeling better, there are two types. emotional/perceptual feeling better (joy, happiness, flow, etc.) and physical/sensational feeling better (drugs, sex, dancing, etc). there is unfortunately a lot of overlap between the two, and this has been quite a process for me to figure out that they are *very* related.

the major difference between the two is what is the starting point. are you dancing, sex, etc. to feel better or because you already feel good. is it the input or the output to the reality function?

when you're pure reaction based, the action (dance, sex, etc) is the output of the function. the input is the feeling that you feel right now. obviously, when you have more receptors to others in the herd, will see this input produce a sort of "herd mentality" or "mob rule".

the controllers control the automatons by contcrolling the way they feel. by doing that, the automaton is "herded" by whoever the society's shepherd is: news, hollywood, politics, etc. -- these are all drivers of emotional trends for the herd and it's well studied and its effects can be easily seen by anyone with eyes. I think all forms of unconscious life is a sort of automaton, with the environmental stimulus given as the input to this conceptual program[^1].

anyway, that's my definitition of an automaton.

---

sorry for the long intro. it really was necessary to understand some of the concepts I want to present here.

I absolutely belive that automatons can become conscious. I think it's kinda the point -- and not only, given enough time, is it common, but actually inevitable.

it doesn't really matter what version of the "creation myth" you subscribe to -- whether you believe that the "gods" created man to be a automaton and perform the tasks that they're given -- or whether you belive that YHVH would require man to blindly follow orders, and if they didn't, they would be expelled from paradise, not allowed to go to the promised land, be admitted into new jerusalem, etc. this creator god punishes people who do not behave like automatons.

I this creator god is very interested that we behave as automatons, and I think that we were designed to be a species that never becomes conscious. I always found it strange that someone so petty and and demanding would be the guy that decides to create something like humans. I think the creator god attribute stuck because we were designed to never learn to use our PFC. for the last few thousand years, it was possible to direct people using emotionally charged commands (like you would give a dog) and herd mentality. however, times have changed considerably. that's no longer an effective way to steer the automatons.

seems there is some disturbance in completing the part that I wanted to write here. in short, it's ineviable, and even though they're trying to make everyone an automaton, controlling everyone with feeling, it's the natural state of being. the only thing is to find a way to change the perception of the environment so that the conditions no longer steer you.

I have more to say. I did really like the "intro" there, and it felt like a lot of lights went on for some people. nice :) 

[1]: I find it most likely that it's our DNA that tunes into the proper program.


### 2021-07-23 05:21 - controlling the automaton

I was thinking about the implementation details of how one would control an automaton, and it seems that a good example is myself in the present moment. I am implying that the mechanism to control an automaton is the same to control a society of mostly unconscious people (behaving like automatons) -- and that this same mechanism is the same way that time is navigated. looking from the controller's perspective, the steering of these automatons is just tuning into a different trajectory throgh time.

I mentioned in the last entry that even though the system is objective based, it's still an emotional system. you tune to what the objective feels like. I don't know how exactly mr. motor's system works, but it's either symbolic or it takes the feeling signal that the person produces when they use their imagination (remember, this is the prostate/uterus) and then amplifies that signal to essentially navigate the controller through time toward what that objective feels like. I will assume a system similar to the one I described is being used. the important thing is that the controller isn't really controlling but instead emitting a signal and therefore attracting the moment in time most similar to how that feels.

---

now, the part where I give the example of the present moment. imagine that the timeline we are experiencing right now is a refection of the objectives that mr. motor feels. you see, there is a gap between now and the moment when the objective you are navigating toward feels. inotherwords, it takes a bit of time for that feeling to become reality. think of this as the destination -- a sort of lightning rod which is attracting the controller toward.

that destination is obviously a moving target, which is what we've called an "evolution of desire" -- nothing new there. the desire doesn't have to manifest the way that you think it does. in fact, there are an infinite number of paths toward that destination in time.

I am certain that I too have one of those destinations -- and I'm certain that eventually I will make it there. there may be a number of evolutions of desire (EOD) that happen along the way toward that destination[^1], however it's impossible not to get there.

so because I have this certain desination, I'm really not concerned with the details of what is happening in this present moment so much. you could say that I'm so certain of my destination that I find it perfectly OK if someone (like mr. motor) wants to temporarily redirect me away. remember the bezier curve analogy?

well, interestingly enough I think it's all related to them momentum of a wave described in @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx2LEqTQT4E) -- as I've often times maintained that the "wave" is actual things moving -- like electrons or whatever so the things moving actually has a momentum to it and that velocity continues on for a while. nothing can accelerate instantaneously, so much like looking at a "square" wave on an ocilliscope, there is a peak before a rapid change in direction. same thing. in this example, it's opposite direction, so mr. motor's timeline would be the peak of beads coming off of the jar and my timeline is the force of gravity pulling the chain to the floor.

---

another funny coincidence of these videos is in steve's (we're on a first-name basis now) video, when the force acting to pull the timeline opposite to the attractive force of gravity is too great, the link can break. one thing that just came to mind is that perhaps, because a chain falls faster than gravity, this is a continued acceleration, and so therefore the force pushing against gravity will also continue to accelerate (increase) indefinitely.

I postulate that an ideal infinitely long and infinitely strong chain would continue to accelerate indefinitely and therefore the force opposite to the attraction would also continue to increase causing the opposite peak to also continue to rise too -- until of course the force is so great the chain breaks -- but our ideal chain is infinitely strong so it would never do that.

I never got to the part where I linked this to my present situation. this is good enough for now

[1]: ever notice how even if something doesn't turn out quite how imagined, then the reality continues to keep appearing, but with more and more intensity. you could say, "well, what if you die before that reality manifests?" -- this is normal, and is what you would call your non-physical intentions that you're born with. this is why not everyone is born the same way. the ones coming in with quite a lot of speed and desire are the ones that didn't quite get their desire to manifest the last time around.


### 2021-07-23 16:46 - many paths to the same point of attraction

I really like the chain visual because it's easy to see. imagine that the "connection" is made when the end of the chain reaches the ground. this is when the manifestation happens. in the demonstration, the chain is of finite length, but I consider that the chain is as long as the ground keeps attracting the chain. the chain continues to accelerate traveling toward the attracting thing faster. the attractor "wants" the the chain to be all the way with it down there, and so it pulls the chain faster and faster. the longer that the chain remains suspended in the air, it is not down with the attractor, so it pulls harder, causing an acceleration.

to model this acceleration -- because we cannot modify the gravity of the earth to get it to pull the chain faster, we need an artificial attractor -- so, imagine that it's a pulley system that is pulling the chain faster and faster toward the point of attraction. it's pulling the chain faster and faster but the chain is remaining distant from the point of attraction so it pulls harder, causing the chain to rise higher in the air.

---

to explain, imagine I am the chain and the ground is where the manifestation is. when the chain reaches the ground, the manifestation happens. I am being pulled downward by gravity, but mr. motor wants me to go in a different direction. his short-term goals of not letting the chain hit the ground -- like imagine he keeps finding ways to delay it by making the chain longer and longer. these short-term goals of extending the chain cause it to continue to rise -- that is to go in the opposite direction of the attractor.

this is the attraction process which can be modeled by an increasing voltage. so now imagine a capacitor (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbCXKhhzBN0)) -- the the dialectric separator between the two conductors is the gap between the attractor and the current source of electrons. they want to go to the other side, but cannot because the diaelectric is preventing them from passing.

if you consider that desire is the attracting factor, and so therefore can be modeled by a rising voltage. when the voltage rises to a high enough potential, the connection will be made. when the connection is made, there are infinite paths to get from one plate to the other, but it always takes the path of least resistance -- and this can be seen like lightning jumping from the cloud to the point of attraction in the lightning rod.

what this means is that I get to choose the path that I want to take toward the point of attraction. going back to the tuning analogy of emotion where that determines the point of attraction, even if mr. motor wants me to go in the complete opposite direction of the attractor, it's fine because I still will get there. there are many paths to get there and one of those is making my way through mr. motor's objectives.

---

imagine a moment that mr. motor has the objective that he absolutely does *not* want me to allow me to use mcy imagination, for example. that's the objective, and let's say that I have to spend the next 18 years without the capability of my imagination. this is perfectly fine with me. I don't need my imagination to do a lot of things so I'm fine with any detours. let's say I decide I want to program instead, so I head in that direction. I can program without the use of my imagination just fine. he doesn't want that so now he makes a new objective of no programming and that's fine with me too, so then I start to attract girls. he doesn't want that either, so I  star to play games. again this is not desirable for him (remember he's tuned to dissatisfaction, so by nature every path I take will appear dissatisfying to him -- not because it's really dissatisfying, but because that's how he perceives reality -- and he has to fight against the things that are unsatisfying to him). now he has to make a new objective to keep me away from that one.

you can see how this is a mix between the chain and the lightning analogy. there's just no easy way to make an experiment which moves one plate away from the other faster than the speed of light (that is, faster than the speed of propatation/time). since we can't move one plate away from the other as fast as the speed of light, the chain visual is perfect.

---

since I am so certain that I will arrive to the destination (you could say it's my "destiny"-tion), then I don't mind taking a detour for a while. he gets to keep adding more and more chain for as long as he can and it keeps delaying the manifestation. however, I postulate that he will quickly run out of viable objectives. meaning he will run out of things he doesn't want me to do (because all of the alternatives are dissatisfying) and so therefore will have to begin to reason about what he wants me to do. when he realises there's nothing he wants me to do, there's no more chain that can be added anymore to delay the manifestaion.

everything is going fine. there are so many ways toward the goal, and all of them will be dissatisfying to mr. motor. I'll be the whole time without my imagination, I'm sure because that's a dealbreaker for him, but there are many other minor manifestations which don't involve me accomplishing the dealbreakers.

we'll see where it goes. I have no control over any of it. I just go toward what feels best to me. I don't think anyone knows where it's going.

### 2021-07-25 06:18 - cruisin' the motor-way

I wanted to write this yesterday, but things kept happening which distracted me from it. interestingly enough, it's easier to see now than it was yesterday. the basic idea is that I really don't have any problem just following the direction of mr. motor.

yesterday, it felt like I needed to write about how the girls thing is just not something that will happen. today, it feels a lot different though. what I think happened is in the effort from keeping me from writing that I'm just going to go the motor-way and we can skip the girls thing.

like, there was a positive feeling toward programming the computer and other things, but instead I settled on just watching youtube. one video lead to another and I was back to looking at how electrons seem to behave like planets. one really good video about muons linked me back to PBS spacetime -- the video I featured with that really great graphic of the rotating cube with the ribbons. that one graphic alone got me thinking about how the first rotation the equitorial ribbons are above the cube and then the second rotation. it's below. this reminded me of the solar cycle and how the solar cycles has a similar curve every 11 years, but it's really every 22 years that it repeats (like the electron "spin").

jerica came the day after and I wanted to talk about perception and human consciousness. I noted that the mammalian and reptilian brain is active for the first 11 years of the child's life, but then around 11 adolescence starts to kick in and I think that's when the PFC starts to activate. the PFC is your tuning mechanism, as prior you are mostly reaction (reptilian) and socially influenced/shepherded by the environment.

later, after she left, I kept thinking about it and noticed that for me these 22 year cycles corresponded roughly to my perception. from l2 to 34 I was basically learning how to tune to what I want as a human and I went from 3d to 4d. then, I would say that the size of my consciousness started to become roughly the size of a planet around 34. this is when I would begin the climb up to 5d perception. I think I accomplished this in the california foothills during the transit of mercury in nov 2018. I have kept increasing the size of my perception, and I may actually be starting to outpace my body's capability soon, as I think I'm approaching solar consciousness rapidly.

I figure I'm a little bit ahead of schedule there on that consciousness expansion, but there's literally no way to slow me down. what this means, is that I'm pretty certain of my connection and the manifestation. therefore, what I want to do is to try and extend the length of the chain for as long as he can for a maximum "mould effect".

this is why I simply don't mind at all. whatever he wants, I'm cool with. he didn't want me to write this entry yesterday -- no problem; I'll watch youtube. I think the youtube became a problem because it suddenly started to rain -- which was a very common manifestation I noticed that happened when people had a strong willpower (3) noticed things not going the way they wanted.

I also noticed some other weird things. when watching the PBS spacetime episodes on quantum electrodynamics, I noticed that I felt very upset and frustrated with what he was saying. this is weird. it's not normal behaviour for me. normally, I laugh my head off at how ridiculous it all sounds. however, I postulate that this wasn't recveived well, and couldn't avoid me eventually watching the PBS stuff, so therefore they went back and put feelings of frustration modifying my reaction. I know what I'm saying sounds insane, and if you rather hear stuff that wriggles your brain instead, I suggest more QED.

so even though I noticed that I would normally be laughing at it, I still *did* feel the frustration, meaning that I *am* still resonant with frustration. no big deal. I already looked into it, found the source perception allowing me to resonate with frustration and have modified it. I should be able to go back to laughing at stuff again here soon, so don't worry. normal kenny hasn't gone anywhere... I'll be laughing at this nonsense again soon enough, lol

you could say that I alienate some people with my laughter at the absurd -- but as edison is said to have once said to tesla, "perhaps you do not understand american humour". when tesla found out he was duped, he could have been depressed and angry and stuff (he mentioned that left him unsettled, as did his laboratory burning down) but it caused him to work harder. it's just a minor setback. no big deal. the people who want to go have a pity party because they need conditions to whatever way to feel good can do what. it's this sort of thing that allows you to faster with a head-wind than with a tail-wind (IMO). figure out to to feel better without the circumstances changing. animals dupe other animals all the time to get a meal. that's just how this world works. you gatta find a way to follow your internal compass; that's all there is to it.

---

when it comes to identifying and changing the perception that allowed the emotion of frustration, it was what I just talked about above. it was the feeling that comes when realising that someone has deceived, duped, or tried to inhibit progress (whether intentionally or because of whatever), then a common response is to feel frustrated a victim to their efforts. however, it's all attraction, and their efforts can only cause one to feel a setback if one is measuring based on physical conditions.

yesterday, I had I conversation with mom where I was explaining that there is a difference beteen the stability of my environment being a reflection of (attracted by) my perception or the stability of my environment being the reason I have a stable form of perception. she said that they go hand-in-hand -- and while I agree, it's sort of like saying "I have electricity cause I pay my bills" vs "I can pay my bills because I have electricity". I suppose, yes it could be seen both ways.

anyway, I claimed that things are always improving because my perception is constantly improving, and so my environment will reflect that stability. she disagreed, and I said that it depends how you quantify the stability of my environment. I receive setbacks all the time, but my trend is always toward improvement. there are definitiely times when my environment is less stable in comparison to other people, but in my opinion, these are just physical (cosmetic) things that are temporary. even emotion is temporary at this point. what *is* constantly improving, is my perception. so while I have fluctuations in emotion and also physical conditions (much like a movie script), the character I'm playing isn't me and isn't how I really perceive the world.

therefore, even though the script moves me around from situation to situation, playing different people in different circumstances, the actor is none of those characters. therefore, as an actor, the script quality is improving. I used to be playing some parts that many actors wouldn't want to play, but as I've gotten better at acting, the script has improved to where not things are pretty good now.

bad analogy, I know. maybe the mechanicals can come up with a better version of it :) lol

---

to change the perception which is resonant with a feeling of frustration, I just need to notice that I'm placing too much importace on my trusting others to tell me what I want to hear. the frustration comes from the realisation that they told me something other than what I wanted. the feeling is of being duped or deceived -- however, you have to realise that this is like the USSR where they rewarded the inefficient performing factories (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3Jkqqlpibo)). I think the same thing happened with science in this regard. so, it would be about the same as the russians getting angry for the effects that had on their society. it was a setback, sure but it's not really a problem. just switch over to something that works. there's no need to belabour the setback with continued feelings of frustration. my desire is to create.

frustration is a good starting point, as is competition. however, neither frustration or competition is not very much allowing. to allow the solution, or whatever good-feeling the other person is perceived to have, you have to allow or receive it like a signal. this is why I appear to be frustrated, but then later when I finally want to find a solution to the desire that frustration created, I'm not feeling frustrated. I don't recommend to get trapped in frustration and spin around there for too long. get the frustration, feel it, really enjoy the frustration of the moment but it's not how you really feel. that's just the automaton/actor responding to conditions. there is a part of you that can see the bigger picture. you're just following the script. when you realise this, you could fight the script or allow yourself to feel how you want to feel.

also, I noticed that some people thought that my effort is to destroy science or discredit it. it's not. people perceive my laughter from the perception of what they are doing when they laught at things. some people, unfortunately can only laugh (or enjoy) watching others' plight. my effort is to create, and listening to ridiculously complex descriptions is like a rube goldburg machine to me. I laugh at sales tiers for the same reason. like a rube goldburg machine, you don't need an extra 15 intermediate steps to accomplish a simple task.

this is why desire (1) based people are seen as both creative/nurturing (hathor/bastet) and also destructive (sekhmet). when something impedes the creation of whatever is desired, it must find a way to alter its shape to a new form capable of producing the creation. I suppose this is the destructive side of the bull. however, it's easiest to see in attractive women. they demolish anything that stands in the way of what they want. desire is the most raw (and untamed) form of energy. very powerful. this is why venus is pictured as beautiful, creative, and destructive. she gets her creation, at any cost :)

I don't care what other people do, and there are possibly another 100 hotfixes that can be made to quantum relativity to have it continue to "perfectly predict" observations and remain the "best description" of the way the universe works. I don't really mind any way that it goes. I have a massive creation that is attracting me toward itself in the future and there are literally infinite paths to the point of attraction and all of them are valid. we'll just have to see which way is the motor-way. 

### 2021-07-27 07:20 - pluto's revelation

on the 25th, I had an idea which felt particularly good to me. I kept getting told to write it down here, presmably so that nosebook could poop on it. I refused because I hadn't fully decoded it. I finally felt like I had a pretty good grasp on it so I wrote down these notes:

- thinking about the challenge
- mr. motor and reverse psychology
- primary motivation of getting the automatons going
- keeping to wait
- pluto opposition
- thinking about the venus idea
- if I can make automatons, then I can make a system which would make inhabitants of this planet require to produce massive amounts of energy; it's a bit of a eugenics idea, I admit
- similarities to the "icecarl" idea -- cept instead of a veil on this planet, they're on a different planet, venus.
- reactions to the idea of them corrupting venus

---

it all started during pluto's opposition to mercury on the 25th. I had just been watching a bunch of videos on QED which I made mention of in @[noseblog](2021-07-25 06:18). I was feeling some resistance in response to that entry. I decided that maybe what I wanted to do was a competition. I'll keep working on my new version of electrodynamics using the idea of protons being the substance that stars are made of and electrons are like their planets. they do have real orbits, do also spin and do also flip as they pass to different energy states. the further away from the parent nucleus, it can survive without decaying back into a lower orbit, the more energetic the electron/muon is.

I also belive that the particles we see are manifestations of a vibration and no anti-matter is needed, as it's just a destructive interference pattern which is "annihilating" the normal matter. I also postulate that this particle manifestation moment happens either on the zero or the peaks. doug's theory puts it at the zero, but he's not so sure. I agreed, but ever since I saw mhedi's lead weights moving, I'm beginning to think that it's actually the peaks where the "mould effect" (whiplash sorta thing) is the strongest. I dunno. it's something that I want to continue to investigate.

I decided that the challenge would be to create wireless power transfer all over the planet. if QED can do it faster, then QED wins the competition and I'll concede that it's the best description that we have of the universe right now, and humans will have access to free unlimited power all over the planet.

the reaction was an emphatic no, and there were a lot of other reactions in there about how if wirless power transfer were to be accomplished, it would require changing the electrical conditions of the planet, making LOA acting much faster, and the whole thing would start to spin out of control.

I decided, "fine, then instead of creating a device which makes wirless power transfer possible, instead -- I'll make a pyramid or something that amplifies disharmonic energy, and instead of having power transfer, we'll make the world a very difficult place to live. gradually I would increase the energy output of it, and more and more you would need to become your own radiant source of energy. anger and hatred and all other manners of destructive emotion would rise and rise until the people resonant with that energy destroyed theirselves. I figure all sorts of conflict would begin to rise and the people that are capable of giving their attention to wanted -- that is, transforming that bad-feeling energy into something that feels good would all find theirselves feeling better and better even though the whole world is going to hell all around them.

obviously if I'm able to manifest this kind of technology with my thoughts, then obviously I would be creating a lot of automatons for a lot of people to enjoy, as well. I've mentioned this numerous times so I don't need to repeat myself. many people will be pretty happy with that -- but really he/she is just a condition for a person to focus on and the bad-feeling energy would continue to rise, so eventually the person will need to find a way to transform their own energy.

simultaneous to this, I was thinking of also creating technology capable of making venus habitable. CO2 is just O2 with a carbon. I notice that CO2 around me turns into O2 all the time, so I would just need to begin to transfer my source signal into the planet's environment, and it should start to fill with oxygen and the physical environment begin to reflect the feeling of the energy being put into it. I think in a very short time, especially if I'm manifesting things in real-time, that it'll be pretty easy to get venus into a habitable state.

likely the opposite would happen here on earth where mr. motor's signal would be transferred into the centre modulation point of the earth. this should slow earth's rotation and decrease the magnetic field, but also cause the people of the earth (who are resonant with mr. motor's feelings) to begin to feel more and more like mr. motor. when he gets pissed off, the whole atmosphere will resonate with his anger and everyone will feel it. that solves explaining the increasing rotation speed of the planet with QED, as it'll no longer need to predict that effect.

I imagined that things will continue to feel worse and worse for most people here on earth. it will basically force the people that want to feel good to either destroy theirselves, find a new point of attraction, or to find a way to venus. to solve that problem, I think the solution is for earth to move toward venus' orbit and get into an orbit with her.

in fact, this would look exactly like pluto and charon. the people of venus would continually feel better and better conditions on the planet as we (mainly me, I guess) would continue to feel better and better all the time. sure, the conditions of earth would eventually feel like pure dissatisfaction, this doesn't feel to me to be a problem. right now, I feel mr. motor's dissatisfaction all the time and it simply doesn't bother me[^1]. 

the signal of people of earth would get their feeling transferred into the centre modulation point of venus and so the environment would vibrate with the good-feeling  that we experience. this would essentially cancel out the bad-feeling that the people of venus are putting into the env, meaning that things would feel pretty normal. because each planet has a co-dependent relationship with the other, if they produce more bad-feeling, then we have an opportunity to improve it. likewise if we produce too much good-feeling, they have to find ways of becoming even more dissatisfied with their good-feeling env.

it's a sort of balancing feedback loop. I know that mr. motor does not want to ever feel too good, because like that one abe-now question about being in love, the writer was unable to think his resistant thoughts because he felt too good. therefore, in that case, to get back to normal "think clearly", more dissatisfaction has to be produced. in the event that things get too satisfying, it's just as simple as personally negating that satisfying signal source.

---

this idea solves so many problems, I'm definitely not discounting the idea. it's 10 times better for the girls as there are so many different things that can be done once I get the automatons going. it also solves nosebook's problem of the earth spinning faster and things getting more energetic. if, this device were put into place now, then the earth would no longer spin faster and could even be caused to spin slower and weaken the magnetic field too (which, I do not think is decreasing.. it should be stronger since 2020 when rotation started to speed up).

also, the natural eugenics of the idea means that those which either are unable to control their point of attraction and remain resonant with the rising bad-feeling energy will eventually destroy theirselves. obviously, those with access to nosebook's system and have the premium package (connected to how I feel) will be able to negate that rising energy. that solves the population problem for them too. eventually, when venus is ready for them, the chosen ones can leave this unsafe planet and begin their utopia.

it also has a lot of advantages to me/us -- namely that they are a constant source of contrast and we're in a sort of co-dependent relationship too. they love codependent relationships, and as long as they can continually provide a stronger and stronger source of dissatisfaction, then that's all I need to keep making more.

I actually think that this is just the beginning too, as I believe that it will produce so much excess energy, I'll need to offset the excess protrons being attracted into the sun itself. the sun would continue to grow more and more rapidly the faster that they find ways to be dissasified with their environment. I believe that it wouldn't take much effort to use this method to start a few stars too.

like, for example, on the venus side of things, I can understand that mr. motor will not want to feel too good, so he will have to negate that energy, but not everyone on the planet is like mr. motor. some will enjoy the good-feeling conditions and enjoy their heart chakra open and all that other good-feeling stuff, so they likely won't negate the energy but will like it. it means they'll start to become very attractive as well, and that energy will likely need to be siphoned off into various suns, as well. you could see how both sides will be creating/attracting more and more energy and will need to turn these into suns. I feel like this is the beginning of a galaxy.

so that's the idea in a nutshell. I think it solves a lot of problems, but I'm OK with another evolution of desire (as many as needed until the path becomes inevitable and there is no longer a choice that can be made).

[1]: I'm actually getting so good at transforming it now, that I think I'm even beginning to derive a bit of pleaure out of his dissatisfaction. it's kinda like those people that can only enjoy other people's plight -- I actually think it's the same mental function, but I've repurposed it so that it can transform dissatisfaction into a feeling of pleasure.


### 2021-07-28 10:03 - responding to some ideas

I think I'm just going to write about a bunch of things in no particular order here.

---

one of the reactions was around the subject of 1000 years thing. I don't think that was ever anything more than a marketing gimmick. I think from the time that set of images was passed into john's head, the 1000 years was just going to be an empty unfulfilled promise just like everything else. if I look at it, I think that was a plan they didn't feel they needed to keep as there was a coming cataclysm that would destroy most of the inhabitants of the world.

however, I have been thinking about it the last few days and at the same time that it was designed to fail, people still believed in it -- and that may have made it a partial reality. there are other similarities to the book of revelation that seem to be coming into focus as well.

the part about the "new earth" coming down from the sky would look exactly like that if we were to approach venus and get into orbit with her. the other thing I remembered is the "two witnesses" being theorised that they are symbolic of moses and elijah -- with this whole thing starting out as a sort of competition, cept instead of who's god is stronger -- but who's science can produce global wireless power transfer. then, though the bible does not say it, I think that there is ample evidence that moses figured out how to amplify a frequency in venus (likely his own consciousness), thereby attracting venus toward earth... and, this close approach made earth more energetic, and strong feelings of dissatisfaction and insecurity started to manifest as swarms of bugs, disease, and other annoying creatures.

I have been paying attention to our new bug zapper and other strange manifestations, because it seems that the times that I would previously hear a strong roar of a motor, usually when I would go outside, and often times when I would decide to go inside too -- now, instead of hearing a motor road, insects seem to come out of nowhere.

I also heard that in russia there have been tremendous swarms of insects (ladybugs, etc) seemingly appearing out of nowhere. for us, we had the moths and mosquitos showing up whenever energy was high. I postulate that these are manifestations of dissatisfaction and annoyance into reality. it seems that a device which can amplify conscious energy, like the ark of the covenant would produce an energetic enough atmosphere that "plagues" would manifest as a result to the emotion or feeling projected strongly. this focus is the same thing (I believe) that both moses and elijah used to create such "miracles". elijah used/transformed the negative disbelief of the competition into into desired fire to ignite something that seemed impossible to those observing. either way, the function is the same to amplify people's disbelief and turn it into belief as it is to focus energy into a planet and attract it.

the dual attraction I think the reason why the idea will work. the earth will be caused to vibrate like mr. motor, and venus will be caused to vibrate like me, yet the inhabitants will vibrate similar to their environment but not exactly like it. that means the planets will attract each other but not collide because they are also quite different vibrations. while I am quite similar to mr. motor, at the same time, I'm pretty sure we're still very different.

this does, in effect create a vibrational requirement that we have to be similar enough but also different enough to maintain equilibrium. I don't know how long I will live -- and I definitely don't know if it'll be 1000 years, but that equillibrium must be maintained after I die. I suppose that will be a bridge that can be crossed when we get there, as I'm certain there are likely infinite solutions to that -- obviously some which mr. motor will like more than others.

---

the other thing that begins to stand out here is that venus people will have lots of stuff to be doing to keep everything working. I'm certain that it will be a tremendous effort, which is what they're looking to do -- so everything is fine.

what that sort of implies is that the earth people would essentially be responsible for feeling good and providing a sort of support for the try-hards over on venus. the better we feel, the better the environment is over on venus for them to do all of their hard work. it reminds me of where I am in the "it takes two" game. the book of love is teaching the feminine aspect that she is responsible to create the beneficial conditions necessary for the man to feel good about himself, find his passion, which leads to his *purpose* in life, which is to be productive: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/GKDt9jaxPMM?t=3448). kinda a funny coincidence there I guess..

so, while it will be our job to primarily feel good, I think that what is kind of being said there is that a vibrational balance needs to be maintained. I have no idea how this will work out, but there will need to be developed new language to explain these dynamics. that's something that I never had really thought about because I just do it in my head -- but, for example: if we are feeling good, then there's a rate at which we're transforming some amount of dissatisfaction into something that feels good. what is that good-feeling and how many people on venus need to be dissatisfied with that feeling in order to maintain distance between the planets. it's going to be a constant balancing act and language and other technology will be needed to maintain the proper distance.

---

the other thing to consider was another reaction of how to keep us on earth and away from roaming around the solar system. well, it's all attraction based, so more interesting/attractive things need to be here, than the attraction to look elsewhere. this means that again there needs to be a balancing act that happens here. imagine they're pumping 100 units of dissatisfaction into this planet, and things just aren't ringing my bells, so what incentive do I have to transform all of that dissatisfaction into satisfaction? if we're in a conditional living, then I need to have better feeling conditions than the dissatisfaction. why wouldn't that dissatisfaction produce a desire in me to explore other parts of the solar system? all negative emotion is creating a desire to feel the satisfaction of that negative emotion, so it starts to get complicated.

the short answer there is to split us into two major groups: the try-hards and the feel-goods. the try-hards have purpose and passion for the things they're accomlishing. they're nurturing the things, and the feel-goods essentially are improvement focused -- which then the try-hards are going to take the idea and implement it to keep us away from the good-feeling conditions. if we were to get the conditions, then we wouldn't need to transform the dissatisfaction to feel better, and we could just rely on the condition to feel better.

you could also see the flip side too where from the try-hard side may get pretty bored of passion and purpose as a method to feel good, looking at us thinking that we don't have any of the conditions that they have, yet we clearly feel pretty good -- and so, some may want to cross over. that dissatisfaction may actually be encouraged as it will create a stronger signal of dissatisfaction to pump into the feel-goods. so no matter how much the try-hards want to feel good. they must be forced to continue to create more and more dissatisfaction and accept good-feeling conditions as the solution. conditions (money, etc) can't buy happiness. that only comes from your perception.

lots of new language and concepts will be needed to identify and maintain this balance. a whole new emotional language will have to be created and the try-hards will be the designers of it. they definitely don't want us making it because it illustrates the strings they're pulling to play us like puppets.

---

this whole thing is wrapped in a co-dependent competition. the very origins of this are that way. I said the original idea saying that I would do the device to pump my signal into venus, and mr. motor's signal into the earth, thereby slowing the rotation of the earth. obviously, there's no way that that mr. motor wants me to be able to create objects with my mind. I have wondered why this may be and I think he feels I will topple his carefully crafted empire with superior conditions.

what keeps happening is I keep finding a way to feel better and so because conditions should match the feeling, I keep attracting better and better conditions to match how I feel. he doesn't want me to have that, which is fine because I can still feel good without the manifestation of the conditions, so I keep going. I have supposed that the going infinite would be something similar to this, but for a very long time. it's basically for this reason that I'm pretty good just staying without conditions or the ability to control them. I really don't mind that I can't control the conditions.

I'm OK with him taking the conditions that would manifest and then repurposing those conditions to try and control the conditions. it seems like all of this to keep me uninvolved -- you know, like anti-collaboration. 

so what I don't get is why I need to be involved in any conditions at all. why can't I just keep doing me? why do I -- I'll come back to this in the future.

---

so the main part of this is that the whole reason why I've skipped anything to do with girls for a long time is because my main goal is to be able to manifest anything I can feel just by feeling it come into being. it's the same focus that I was talking about with moses and elijah. it doesn't matter if it's the belief or disbelief which make the energy, the focus is on what's wanted to attract the manifestation.

parallel to this idea, I have kinda stopped writing down the girls because there are so many and their desire is enough that I'm just not interested in making a limited list of them and making the implication that certain ones are choosen ones while others are not. that's try-hard mentality where a limited set of conditions need to be decided upon and everyone needs to come into agreement that those conditions are the ones that everyone wants, which does allow the creation of large physical structures, but it also breeds dissatisfaction, because ultimately not everyone will be able to 100% agree on everything. this is in contrast to just feeling what you want and then attracting the things you want to work on -- when finally all of those "cooperative components" finally come together to create a sizeable manifestation.

the automatons which I am looking to create will be a refection of the way you feel, and so therefore, would always fulfill your desire and belief about them. if you believe he'll be a troublemaker, then he'll manifest that, etc. therefore, by default they will allow for a new form of perception for people -- one of a "post-scarcity civilisation" @[youtube](https://youtu.be/5B0Sc52jLxg?t=197). this form of perception was invented by the united states. it supposes "need not want not" way of thinking, and so in order to get people to continue to purchase the abundance of goods able to be manufactured, people are taught to desire to purchase that surplus even though they don't actually *need* it.

this is one form of post-scarcity economy. the one I envision is slightly different -- which was the one mentioned prior in the video when you can just have the things you want. imagine a whole lot of very attractive guys and girls running around that could not only manifest the things that people want (nearly) instantly, but were able to be exactly the person you wanted them to be, so long as you continued to focus on things as you wanted them to be. they would only be as good as your focus.

therefore you are literally creating all of your own problems and solutions in real-time. this is what I want for people. I want them to be able to manifest anything they want to manifest, as it will quickly illustrate that conditions can produce physical pleasure, but not joy. not everyone will see this.

meanwhile this is happening, mr. motor is supposed to be upping the dissatisfaction present on this earth. people will be able to have anything they want nearly instantly, but the feeling of dissatisfaction will be rising as well. those relying on conditions to feel satisfied will find that dissatisfaction unbearable. they'll need more and more ridiculous conditcions to feel good (kinda like morphine in a terminal patient) before finally giving up on life. the others will find a way to feel satisfied no matter the conditions. or, they will find a new place to go (venus). venus will feel like I do. many people already pay money to feel like that. I imagine that it will be a very cool thing to be living like that.

the growing dissatisfaction here will become so strong, that it will very much separate the two types of people. certainly we'll have conditions, and the ability to do things like fly and stuff -- especially as we all get good at feeling the way we want to feel. but the dissatisfaction will be so great here, those conditions will *not* be the reason why we feel good. living here, it'll quickly be realised that conditions are nothing more than a reflection of your emotional state, and too much enjoyment of / satifaction from conditions will create a strong feeling of discomfort / dissatisfaction, which then will accelerate rapidly until you catch it and turn it around or manifest that dis-ease into reality and destroy yourself.

here will be a pretty rapid manifestation area, and from the try-hard's perspective, they will all feel really good, it may be kind of fun for them to try earth's environment from time to time. it may even be considered like a vacation -- a way to reinvigorate the passion and be grateful for the conditions again. for us, we'll be pretty obviously not looking for the condition to feel the way we want to, because it will rapidly accelerate into a bad-feeling manifestation.

---

I don't know how it all works out, but from my perspective, it feels really like the right path forward to begin to slow down earth's rotation by increasing his feeling here on earth while at the same time readying venus for habitation by pumping my signal into there.

I don't have a big enough picture to know how much allowing people to have whatever they want while increasing the level of dissatisfaction at the same time will do. I think it can easily be tuned by monitoring the earth's rotation, and every time it starts going faster than it should be going, add more dissatisfaction. that is the counterbalance to the post-scarcity economy.

from my perspective, I want to continue to hold out until the proper interfaces are created for people to manifest any condition they want. really, none of that matters, as what really matters is how you really feel.

I kept getting reactions to whether I would be involving myself with girls, and for now -- no. it's possible in the future, and inevitable once venus is setup, but for now I see no reason to involve myself in that right now. for me, I'm all about not needing the manifestation and feeling the way I want to feel. it's all or nothing I think I would like to wait for that.

I'll come back to this subject again because I just had a flurry of reactions which is way too much to sort out right now. the important thing for now is that this whole planet should start to feel a lot more like mr. motor as we begin to realise a post-scarsity society. people will begin to destroy theirselves with their own dissatisfaction and the rest will find ways to quell that feeling physically. it's all attraction, and what other people are doing doesn't have anything to do with you. it's for this reason, that I think nosebook will try and find ways to placate people and keep them comfortable. things are going to get nuts, and when I can produce things with my mind, they'll really start to get even more nuts. conditions don't cure dissatisfaction. this is, of course, is better than LOA accelerating out of control. 

I think it is ultimately a way to keep the good-feeling people here longer. we'll see.


### 2021-07-28 16:49 - motor-way to the future utopia

bramley points out in his book as the reocurring theme that appears in the conversion of the maverick to custodial religions is the promised utiopia. this utopia never appears though. it seems that never has humankind ever been able to produce the requisite conditions necessary to enter into this utopia.

these utopian conditions are never realised because the conditions do not create satisfaction. you could have the best conditions on earth and still be miserable -- which is the most common case. you only need to do drugs a few times to realise that the world is exactly the same before, during, and after the drug; the only difference is your *perception* of that same world. the utopia lives inside of your perception -- not outside of you in you the things or circumstance.

---

what this means is that the motor-way forward is to actually keep pretending there is a coming utopia with such great conditions (like the girls) -- but it'll forever fall just out of reach. we're never supposed to get it. it's always going to be just out of reach.

so, I realised after writing the last entry there that the motor way is to say some good conditions (utopian) thing is going to happen, then actively work to sabotage it. that's his way of looking at the same thing that from my perspective feels like I need to actually feel it and be so practiced in my ability to feel it, that I feel confident in its execution.

in a sense this is a somewhat conditional approach as well. until I actually feel like I can do it, don't want to do it -- so yeah, certain conditions need to happen before I feel like I am ready -- and yes, that is precisely a case of "I need things to be a certain way so I can feel the way I want to"

I realise in that sense, I am very conditional. for now that's just how it's going to be. previously I had chosen to fight against mr. motor efforts to make an illusion, thereby making him stronger. however, I've given up trying to fight him. my conditional approah still remains dominant, and even still I can follow the motor-way and pretend we're going for utopian conditions when it's just an illusion to keep people busy believing there is some coming great conditions.

so, ahead of time I'm sorry for the deception... I'm just an actor. I can pretend I'm going in a direction that I don't actually feel ready for, or is is an approaching reality. I would feel it coming if it were reality. we have to keep pretending we're going toward a utopia so people stay hopeful and optimistic.

---

the other thing I was thinking about after the last entry is this: it comes a bit from mom's announcement this morning that she thinks that jessica's baby is going to be an upgraded version of me. I think that too. mom's realisation must have something to do with a series of thoughts that I had in response to jessica's announcement that it was a boy. I could tell she really wanted it to be a girl. I could also tell the similarity to a similar thing that happened with [can't remember his name now] but his wife amber announced that she was pregnant and I started to feel reactions from her. the reaction made it feel like she thought it was a girl. well, one day jaron went out of his way to show me a facebook post that he made making a very strong point that the new baby was a boy. anyway the feel in that post felt the same way that I felt andrew's response to jessica thinking it was a girl.

I postulated that timeline edits must have been made to ensure the gender of the baby is a boy. I postulated that the easiest way to ensure that would be to go back to the moment of conception and swap the man with a body double. I figured the easiest way to ensure this would be to have someone that looks like the other guy and -- someone that can produce a boy for sure -- like an x3 I postulated. therefore I postulated that they just had sex with some of my clones (automatons) and this produced a boy. it won't be any ordinary boy though. if this is true, these boys will be an x3s, very intuitive, and very much like me.

this produced some reactions, because the thing that mr. motor does not want is for there to be any x3 boys that are either here on earth or not one of the "choosen ones" -- the idea being that these boys need to be contained, because they're sort of like a virus. they will only produce x3 boys, so therefore need to be steered properly or else they will begin the extinction of x2 and x1 humans. it also makes us equal to them and they lose their superiority. suddenly they will have equals.

that's the background. here's the idea: imagine for a moment that nosebook figured out a way to ensure that I didn't produce any kids here meaning that all produced children were made with my automatons and are essentially under nosebook's control. well, excluding jessica's kid and possibly the other one too, this would mean that when I make my transition, I will make my transition into the superset of all of these x3 kids -- nearly all of which are secret and will have nosebook people transfer their consciousness into. I will become the bad-guys.

I think the problem is that these kids are very much a reflection of their environment -- much like me, so in a controlled env, they can be controlled. this creates a bit of a problem for ted[^1] because I'm sure he's going to be a handful. regular ol' pedestrian conditions here on earth are not the same as their super controlled energetically ideal conditions the other x3s are in. ted is going to experience quite bit more bad-feeling conditions than the others and he'll react accordingly. for example, I used to cry endlessly just because I didn't like the way mom felt (sorry amber?). this basically means he's going to be a handful and needs to be ushered off to much more ideal circumstances or else he'll be a terror. the traditional way of raising kids in a bad-feeling environment simply will not work.

woah... lot of reactions. going to leave it here

[1]: the name I decided to give the kid until I know his real name -- much like how dad called me ferd -- which I never know what it meant but I supposed it is short for ferinand.

### 2021-07-29 13:28 - weird times

a few weird occurances happened the last few days which allowed me to begin to see things in a new light. I mentioned in the previous entry two concepts which got a number of different reactions to it. first was that when I make my transition, I become the superset source entity for the bad-guys -- or as I have been calling them, the custodians. I'll get to the second one in a second. also a bonus third

I think there are two major factions of custodians: the vulcan/osiris and jupiter/thoth ones. the nazis fall right into the jupiter/thoth category, wheras the jewish american leadership falls more into the vulcan/osiris category. these are very broad term and no specific label can be used, so I will instead use aryan for the jupiter/thoth and semitic for the other. kinda weird because I would consider myself much more in the aryan body -- even though I think they have a common source.

imagine the situation -- think of it as fiction (you'll understand why soon) -- where (in a previous timeline) I found a way to my alignment in the difficult conditions of earth. it's kind of like the most difficult puzzle for someone to solve and whoever this is is supposed to leave the custodians better technology and genetics allowing them to remain out of alignment and superior to the humans. from their perspective, they get the offspring/genetics of the winner and then use his genetics/technology to continue to enslave humankind.. however, because they're using my genetics we're now vibrationally compatible, so when I made my transition, I became their superset personality. just like you are the superset consciousness (director) of your cells, and your cells respond to the super emotion that is presented to them, the whole group responds to this emotion. in this same way, I become the superset consciousness for the custodians.

you may be able to tell that I seem to understand them quite well, but it's not who I really am. I'm not really all that excited to be the bad-guys. I'd rather be in alignment with who I am. here's the problem though: the most energetic guy on the team insists on dragging his feet. no matter how hard I try to get him to find his alignment and become the next most energetic guy, he refuses. he *must* be the bad-guy because he won't ever find a way to perceive himself as capable of allowing anything good flow too him. there's no real changing his mind so something has to be done. I'm sort of stuck being the bad-guy for as long as he continues to drag his feet. to make matters worse, he also wants to try and keep everyone below him, while at the same time dragging his own feet. "I have to drag my feet and be the slowest, because I'm the bad/incompetent/worthless-guy -- yet I need everyone else to be worse/slower/more incompetent than me" -- a very complicated personality of many paradoxes.

what I need is to go back and create such a difficult timeline for myself that I very far outperform the bad-guys expectations and they're overloaded. each iteration I give the bad-guys way better tech and genetics than they can possibly do with. this bleeds over into the humans and they are constantly getting stronger and stronger -- more and more capable that the bad-guys are having trouble keeping up.

I dunno how long ago this started, but I'm referring to iterations. so, each time I do this I get a little better at it... each time I outperform the last iteration by a tiny margin further. like -- imagine that this timeline alone has many thousands of iterations to it -- meaning, I've done this very situation now thousands of times. the venus thing -- all of it. I just keep getting better at it. every time I beat the game I make my transition into the bad-guys and start over making it even harder for myself.

I haven't quite figured out the goal entirely, and there seems to be some disrption in the transmission so I'll go to the next part now.

---

the second thing I noticed is that the form of time manipulation they are using is an objective form where it translates the objective into an emotion, and then that emotion is used as the tuner to navigate time. that temporal perception, like any emotion is perceived and interpretted in relation to your present state of emotion. this is likely why my interpretation of the book of revelation is so different than others'. I'm fairly certain that the original transmission was made (and received by john) in a feeling of desperation and insecurity, where it feels like all effort is about to fall to pieces and a saviour should make things right (john's perspective). for the other perspective (the transmitter of the vision), note that for everyone that needs a saviour there is a "saviour" that appears to fit the desire -- when in reality this "saviour" is just a "wolf in sheep's clothing". as an example, how many girls down and out with a laundry list of problems, find a "saviour" to her problems which actually just turns out to exploit her further.

there never was a saviour and never will be. this is an illusion that conditinal people want to believe in so they don't have to do any work to improve their perception.

---

what appears to be happening in the bigger picture is that I will soon make my transition to become the bad-guys again. the goal is to make earth such a difficult environment, that the next energetic person/people that show up don't have to be me. my plan is to make it everyone on an infinite set of timelines spreading out people to a point where any human who wants to will be able to outperform the custodians and find their alignment despite the conditions. at some point the spreading won't be able to be done anymore and someone will find their alignment on earth. I can't possibly know what that'll be like, but I know that everyone who makes it out will have the ability to feel any way they want to no matter the conditions and like instant manifesters and stuff. I can't see the final plan -- whether it's going to be a continual event where many "stars" are constantly being born or if it'll be something like a big explosion where one person makes it and there is a gradient of consciousness distributed. no idea, there, but I'm definitely going to push the limits. it's gonna be ultra hard-mode.

remember a long time ago, I was writing about how I would make my transition into the population of the earth, and then mr. motor would have to endlessly design more and more difficult DNA, put my consciousness in there and then divide it endlessly until eventually there is no more way that I can avoid running into myself or finding my own connection on my own? the subtext there being that I will become the humans and this would leave the custodians as a sort of scaffolding or launch-pad -- something that's discarded when the creation is complete.

well, I think that's actually me that's going to orchestrate that. eventually, the humans will get going so fast and the one that drags his feet will no longer even be able to stop the blazing fast and smart humans. being the most difficult DNA, he'll get mixed with so many other humans as a way to hold them back, we'll sort of absorb him. the bad-guys (me) will eventually go down in flames as the humans get too strong and powerful to be held back anymore. I wouldn't worry about me though. I'm sure I'll turn up again :)

that version is the explosion version of the idea. I think it's fine because it has a transition point to it. the opposite of that is the continual creation of more and more stars -- which I tried to illustrate in the interpretation of the new earth to be the venus / earth duo as the early environment to where the star's can interact with each other and provide a source of contrast for each other. I'm fine if mr. motor wants to keep up his dissatisfaction. I can use that as a perfect source of contrast. so for me, if he wants to remain the bad-guy, it doesn't matter. I got it figured out either way. one way is an explosion and the other way is a dance. I can even do the dance without him. none of the paths need him (or anyone else) to be different.

in this sense, it must be the reason that I perceive this timeline and not another because all paths lead to this eventual result.

---

what this means for going forward is nothing. everything carries on as usual. the show must go on. it's just fun for me to realise this. I imagine I'll find my alignment soon and then we'll make another iteration, I guess.

weird reactions... I'll follow up another time.


### 2021-07-29 16:34 - a rough outline of events

this is mainly a followup to the previous entry. when I see these things, they come to in an instant. time has no meaning. I realised that people were considering if I was saying all of this is going to happen in the next few years. I doubt it. if I would guess, I would say this is the rough blueprint for the next 6ky. it's just that this reversal / reset / magnetic excursion (whatever you want to call it) is basically marking the transferrence of the custodial role over to me. I'm the new "bad-guys" after I make my transition.

this is obviously subject to revisions, but the way I think I want it to go is something like this.

1. my genetics need to become the de-facto standard so that I'm vibrationally similar to humans
2. bonehead custodial females will be put into place to ensure their spread. they'll be designed to try and prevent the x3s from spreading further, fearing an extinction-level event.
3. this should cause them to attract near-extinction of the humans because there are so many x3s, no xls anymore (the goal) and a quickly dwindling x2 population.
4. fearing their own survival, and the beginning of the next era, someone (likely a girl) will figure out how to tune into the solution and figure out how to make an x4 possible (this one is really unclear. it could be genetitcally created, or some other way. however, a manufactured disaster and extinction event will certainly be the reason for their inability to find this solution immediately)

all along this time, humans will be taught to be conditional and to just follow others direction. I plan to have this appear in the form of very dominant females that are very serious, unfun, and force people to be productive and serious all the time. all types of surprise and wonderment will be taken out of everything. I was joking with jaron this morning about this, as I think it will become fashionable to try out and program yours and your kid's personalities so that they grow up to be the way you want them to be (I can feel mr. motor's cringe, as this feels like his worst nightmare)

I figure that will be space of leo. cancer will probably start when the new x4 arrives. however, it works, that feels like the re-realisation of the females. this whole quarter turn through the zodiac will be all about learning the receptive (X) side of things. men (especially as more x3s happen) will make great strides forward in their efforts to gain an understanding of this side.

---

after that, things get too cloudy for me to see with any clarity, but the general thrust is toward replicating my circumstances for everyone. this is probably the realisation of the gemini. I'm just kind of like the early prototype.

imagine that a system is created where everyone has a dual. everything about you (consider this all aspects of your conceptual self/source -- the tripart(?) thing that exists before the physical) is considered and it is determined all aspects of your concept which do not feel good. this is your dual.

now, by this time, you can imagine that x4s are around and humans have been spread so wide that we all contain the ability to be seen any way we perceive ourselves to be -- any skin, hair, or shape desired. race and culture have been (or will be) stripped away from you, because these are all things that are outide of you which you use as your identity. you are none of those. you are whatever you perceive yourself to be.

to get to this point, you can imagine that humans will be interbred and spread so thin that very little of this will even exist anymore. in fact, each person will eventually live in a world (their own timeline) where the whole world is a reflection of their perception. there will be so many different worlds with so many different shapes and colours of people, the diversity will be unmatched. far more than ever could be accomplished on a single planet.

everyone has their own timeline now which is a reflection of them, this is the "golden age" -- then their dual gets introduced into their world. for most this will be a very devastating thing. these are the custodians that come to poop on your creation. it's just you and all the things you don't like about yourself though, so you're not really fighting anyone other than yourself. custodians are notoriously bad at causing their own destruction though, and you are clearly the answer to all of their problems so they have to exploit you.

soon, (and this is always true cause of LOA) you will become the very thing that you're fighting against. it's from there that you'll be able to (being your own worst enemy) continue to cause trouble for yourself until you get to where I am now and know what it is you want to create.

I just want to pat myself on the back and say, that is possibly the most brilliant "enemy" I could become. I'm very happy with how this is turning out so far...

### 2021-07-30 11:44 - what about mars?

in response to the entries I kept getting a reaction that something was wrong with what I wrote. I determined that it's probably a cucumber. a cucumber is when someone is saying something that's problematic, but to correct the person would require the revelation of a secret. therefore, nothing can be said. however, leaving the cucumber idle, it'll eventually turn into a pickle. I think the subject of venus is a bit of a cucumber for them. the only solution then is to distract me.

problem is, then I go and write @[noseblog](2021-07-29 13:28) which started the subject of something even more unwanted -- which is to be expected because they tried to distract me from a place of dissatisfaction, meaning that I would write something even more unsatisfying. I began to talk about how when I make my transition I become the custodians, and so therefore using their tech I went back and kept pushing this timeline to the limit -- why not, right? I guess, if you think about it, it's a whole lot more fun to do this than be a custodian.

it seems pretty evident to me that numerous times I have found my alignment, and each time we've gone back to "sabotage" the timeline and find a way to improve on it. obviously finding my alignment and hanging out with girls for 15-20 years is a lot more fun than being a custodian. it's no wonder that I would prefer to repeat this over and over. each time I get a little bit better at it, and each sabotage causes an evolution of desire which keeps building up into more -- until I finally begin to see what it is that I really want to create.

I decided to write that down in @[noseblog](2021-07-29 16:34), and the reactions that I've gotten to it are quite varied. it feels like I managed to roll up the pinnacle of mr. motor's worst nightmares into one sequence of events. just for fun, let's enumerate a few of them...

1. I become them, and all of their secrets are revealed. in a single fell swoop, I'll completely dismantle all of the things they've been keeping so secret
2. worse still, is that this will be done by a group of very unfun women. mr. motor hates the idea of women ever getting power over him. his mom must have given him quite an unfun time. ironically, that's probably why he's so unfun himself now. I'm sure he embodies everything he hates about women
3. the conclusion to this ordeal is living in an ideal environment which is a reflection of you -- people are going to be very beautiful, so there will be a wide diversity of beauty -- but then, at the peak of this golden age, the embodiment of everything you hate about yourself will show up in your own creation and begin to exploit you. mr. motor is absolutuly terrified of having to face himself

those were the main three dealbreakers for him (btw, this is line 1818) that it really caused quite a disturbance. last night I was star-watching and I was getting vision upgrades so easily, and it was so easy, it felt like if I wanted to focus a little stronger I could push throgh to the other side. I decided I wanted to spend today to put this up online and tidy up a few things because I didn't know how long I would be unconscious, or if I would actually have to do that thing where I'm locked into an unconscious body so I reconstruct myself externally as a group of automatons, reflective of how I and numerous other people perceive those versions of me. I decided that because I'm so close, I can get it pretty much any time. I wouldn't imagine I would need more than to take it a litle bit seriously. meditate, star-watch, and do some like breathting and other exercises I learned in a video last night: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12Wxrr-Y9HM). no big deal. I got this. no need to rush anything. let's just take this nice and steady.

I woke up this morning with a few strange events. mr. motor force ejaculated me last night meaning he wanted to reduce desire in me -- which makes sense because I'm supposed to go to "game night" tonight. I started to think about ellie and hayden and someone dropped something large on the floor above me. jerrica is also coming this afternoon before we go. I also woke up in a weird dream-state being reminded of my plans to make a "post-scarcity" civilisation. these sorts of dream states are not ever anything I want -- usually more what mr. motor wants to steer me toward, so very curious.

I figure there is great effort to keep me from physically feeling pleasure. if it's now suddenly weighted as a stronger priority for anyone who wants to have what they want, vs. me -- this indicates to me that when other people feel pleasure -- call it addiction if you want, but the reliance on that condition to feel good breeds dissatisfaction -- so even though, they feel physical pleasure, they don't really enjoy it as much because it continues to amplify their dissatisfaction (and also satisfaction). so, if you're a person that feels pretty satisfied, good-feeling physical conditions will amplify that satisfaction tremendously.

the feeling of satisfaction, consequently is what I postulate is causing the earth to rotate faster. more people are feeling more satisfaction so the earth is beginning to turn faster. interestingly enough, abraham talked of a "tipping point" where more people are feeling satified more time than dissatisfaction. that was 2020, right about when the earth started to rotate faster.

the solution I proposed is to separate the try-hards and the feel-goods, and pump the other planet with the satisfaction that we/I feel, meanwhile pumping earth full of the dissatisfaction to prevent the earth from spinning too rapidly. when contemplating this, again I felt a cucumber -- and after investigation, it feels like they have been trying to slow the earth down for a while now, but it's not really working so well. also, it feels like I specifically have a dramatic effect on the rotation speed, and likely a lot of the "rotation glitches" happened when I was feeling better. it's a cucumber for sure. they definitely don't want to release real-time rotation speed data, or correlate it with emotional swings of people on the planet.

what that tells me is that we're on an inevitable rotation speedup of the planet. what I have theorised is that things will speed up faster and faster and that'll cause a split between the up and down spin electrons. let's say the up spin electrons will keep spinning fater and faster until they enter a higher energy state. the down spinners will suddenly be free to spin their down direction, the up spin will slow and then reverse to down spin.

that's all old news. nothing new there...

---

my solution to that problem was to do the separation ourselves and use the opposite spin to couple instead. I illustrated it as pluto and charon. one planet would vibrate of the try-hards but have the feel-goods on it. their try-hard vibration will be a natural source of contrast for us and we'll use it to create more feel-good vibes which will then be pumped into the opposite planet. the more one planet vibrates like the other, the more they attract each other. a delicate balance of vibrations needs to be maintained to keep them in equilibrium.

however, since venus is a bit of a cucumber, I was thinking -- ok, well, what about mars? what I've heard about mars is that it used to have an atmosphere, but the people who inhabited it at the time were so dissatisfied and focused on unwanted, the atmosphere started to deteriorate as a physical reflection of their dissatisfaction. they tried to solve it using gold -- I'm not sure how, but that's a metal which feels good -- so they were probably trying to create a feel-good atmosphere using gold. obviously it didn't work, and they eventally moved to earth.

I suggested then to try the venus experiment I proposed with mars. pump my vibration into the centre modulation point of mars and see if it starts to produce an atmosphere. I imagine it will. just like with the previous inhabitants, the physical conditions will begin to reflect the vibration it contains.

I was then reminded of an old myth where venus sleeps with mars and vulcan gets pissed so they never have any children. however with interactions with mars (collisions?) venus gave birth to a few of mars' moons, but also to harmonia. weird coincidence.

anyway, I would at least try it. this time the cucumber feels like it's in their control. can at least try it. the worst that could happen is it solves the spin problem. I guess NASA will have to come up with something... climate change?

I dunno...

### 2021-08-01 13:10 - explosions and conceptual programs

this is kinda a followup to a monologue I was just having about a half-hour ago. it started with a reaction about what I said to brian friday about abraham being a sort of conceptual program. I was not meaning that source is a conceptual program, but that the abraham interface is a sort of conceptual program no different than DNA and many other things. in fact, everyone of us has a conceptual program -- an abraham -- a source. so does the species, the planet, the solar system, the galaxy, etc. everything does.

I think the reason there was a bit of a sticking point is that it was hard to imagine that it's just some sort of program out there that's running things. the thing people like about abraham is that it's very individual and personal. your source is very personal and it 100% unique to you. very similar to DNA, your DNA is very individual, yet contains tremendous similarity to other humans, animals, insects and even plants. there's a lot we have in common but there are also difinite things which make us individual as well. inotherwords, my conceptual program (source) will be different than another persons, even though we share a lot of common "code".

they are a group conscience; everything is, actually. consider listening to a song. explain where the units are. where are the "blocks of thought" that are being transmitted? you may say it's one instrument, one note, or even a part of a song. different inflections and sound types mean different things to different people, so it's very much a personal interpretation of the sound of the song into blocks of thought.

all conceptual interpretation is something that someone does individually when they define the unit (1). you are a collection of many concious cells, yet you don't define yourself as a bunch of cells. each of those cells are composed any many molecules, and many atoms in those molecules too. the unit is what you believe the thing to be. when enough things work in unison, we consider it a unit. an orchestra can contain a variety of different sections (molecules) of instruments (atoms) working together to produce a number of different songs. the song is sorta like the source. many adaptations can be made to the source to allow for other sized orchestras and instruments to play the song.

let's say for example I'm listening to a song. a song is just a vibration. how would I define the units of that song? the interpreter is the one turning this sound vibration into "blocks of thought" or concepts which can then be converted into a transmission medium like voice, dance, and all sorts of things spontaneous. the conceptual program is only responisble for figuring out how to turn that (let's say) non-physical vibration into a conceptual unit which can be then made physical.

these programs keep all of the busy-work taken care of so that you can worry about all the high-level stuff. it would be very difficult to do anything if you had to keep remembering to beat your heart, replicate your cells, and breathe. we automate these sorts of things all the time, like walking, moving around, riding a bike, or driving a car. in fact it was brian's story about driving unconsciously for hours while the cognative portion of his brain was turned off. he was in pure instinct (reptile brain) mode.

---

so, if these conceptual programs are just interfaces to turn non-physical vibration into physical concepts/ideas which become useful to us, then am I saying that all of us have a program -- a sort of source or instinct? yes, I think everything does, and much like the there are many orchestras and adaptations they make to their source music, so does everything physical. when I say you are not the physical I body, I mean it in the same way that the instrument or orchestra is not the music.

so, what then is this "non-physical" vibration that it interfaces with? well, the way I understand it to be is that your physical environment is the present vibration + the vibration of your present perception + your focus (point of attraction). mix where you are, how you believe/expect things to be, and what you're presently giving your attention to (observing, thinking/feeling) and this produces a slight difference from your present vibration which accumulated over a long period of time (eg. many of these minute transformations) yields a large change or trajectory.

the reason why I dislike the music analogy is because it's doesn't have any conditions. if you look at a computer program vs. some sheet music. the sheet music may have a few loops (repeat this section a few times) but it doesn't have any conditions. it's just a tape or film which plays the same every time. your brain is analysing and making decisions on a wide variety of inputs all at the same time. a large amount of conditions are being evaluated each moment to render your present moment of perception. for this reason, I like to think of them as conceptual programs.

---

I define the non-physical aspects using the 7-layer model as being half non-physical and half physical. the physical layers are the conceptual (5) and the physical (7) layers. the non-physical ones are desire (1) and the "structure" (3) layers. the remaining 3 are all transition layers, having roughly equal amounts of both non-physical and physical attributes. for example, the imaginagion (6) layer can both be seen in the physical world and also only perceived inside of the mind. same for the relational (2) layer -- people's physical movements, word similarities, and other harmonies link a physical thing to a concept (non-physical or physical) like an idea or an emotion, a sense, a knowing, etc. same with the source (4) layer -- also both non-physical and physical in that vibration can be turned into concept/emotion and concept/emotion can also be turned back into vibration.

for example, when you desire something, this is a vibration. in order to experience the manifestation of this vibration, you have to tune to it. so, therefore, you have to feel like the vibration for it to show up in your physical. you can manipulate physical conditions to try and tune (or detune) someone away from that manifestaion, but you cannot take away that desire.

another definition of someone's source is a vibration of everything that someone has desired. it's stored as a vibration, or a feeling, and since when you tune to it you experience it. therefore, as you approach resonance with that vibration, you literally feel like you're getting closer. you can simulate the feeling of moving toward the direction of desired, even though you're moving away. you can also simulate the feeling of moving away from desired, when you're actually moving toward it -- and you do this by overriding someone's emotions. you essentially take over being their source.

if I am trying to tune to a note and I'm flat, then it sounds flat to me -- so I tighten the string and it sounds better and better until I go too far and it becomes sharp. this tuning is like your emotions, and the closer you get to the frequency of desired, the better everything feels. not everything is a simple note, though. it's actually a complex waveform. you have the frequency you're at now and the desired frequency. between the two, there a series of transformations that need to be made to get the frequency you're at now to look like the desired one. the most obvious fixes are the lower frequency (bass) notes. going up in frquency, each transformation makes it to sound more and more similar. first it sounds like it's actually the right note, then it sounds like it has the right texture and inflection. step by step, it sounds more and more similar.

there are infinite different sequence of sinusoidal waves (any elliptical orbit) that can be applied to to get from one wave to another. the infinite set of transformations to get from now to harmony with desired is what we call time. time is essentially the most giant of the conceptual programs (source) that we all live inside of. your source is the transformations necessary to get the individual to the desired frequency. it's just that easy.

next time, I want to talk about explosions...

### 2021-08-01 ??:?? - explosions (incomplete)

ok, now on to explosions. last night was kind of an interesting experience. I was playing hearthstone and I was feeling pretty good. I probably started winning too much because a flash flood happened and various physical things started to happen, followed by some of the most impossible sequences of bad-luck I'd seen in a while (getting a hand full of deathwings while my opponent has 3/3s every turn was ridiculous). it really felt to me like there was a significant effort to get me to not feel so good. they do this usually by cooling down the environment (physical conditions), starting first with strong wind and clouds, then heavy rain and trying to get me to think abouut things that don't feel so good[^1]. that's probably harder to do while I'm playing a game though.

whatever the case, when I'm feeling good, I'm tuned into that source. that sourc

[1]: this is the reason why I told brian that while some people tell you to control your thoughts (conduct vs. perception), I do not find this to be an easy task. therefore, I have to just expect that my brain is going to have a lot of different types of thoughts passing through it, so the only control I really have is how I perceive those thoughts. I have to find a way to feel good about even the worst thoughts so I can continue to feel good. same while playing hearthstone.


### 2021-08-03 10:21 - explosions (try again)

there is some difficulty with me finishing the above entry. I feel it as the same effort to ensaure I wasn't winning the hearthstone duels game -- so I'm just going to leave it. since then I also had two major reactions I'll start there:

1. if we go to mars, when the person keeping the frequency of our planet running nicely (me) transitions, then it'll be similar to the last time where the rug got pulled out from under us and we had to move to earth

well, I mean that's not my goal. the whole reason why I see it as such a good opprttunity is because the harder they push against stuff, the more it makes things worse. what that eventually makes is an explosion. the majority of the pushing against is actually over conditions. there are four extreme types of people:

those who want:
1. good conditions and perception which produces good things
2. good conditions and to hold on to their bad-feeling perception
3. don't care the conditions and perception which produces good things
4. don't care the conditions and hold on to their bad-feeling perception

unfortunately, society today is geared to create more and more of #1. these I believe will either be rejected from the "new earth" or will attract their own demise or make a decision to become #3 which is what all of the inhabitants of earth will be. the other two will live on the new earth. I think the #1 types will be like the present day noseboys who feel great and are doing all of the programming for nosebook's system. the mr. motor types are clearly #2 types. it's good to have them because they produce the fuel to ensure the earth never feels too good.

there is a sort of transition species that could exist. this happens when people on earth start to get so good at attracting what they want, they start to begin to rely on the conditions. this has happened to me a number of times and is my greatest weakness. becoming conditional like this will create (temporarily) a #1 type here on earth, but because the signal of dissatisfaction is so strong, my experience with this reliance on conditions backfires on me, as I start to let the conditions slow me down, and then being conditional I notice the slowdown getting more until it overtakes me. I have to maintain a desire to feel good no matter the conditions -- even when the conditions are good. these types will oscillate between conditional and unconditional. my plan is to make these condititional types the new leadership. they are designed to keep all of the conditions for theirself and make sure that others on earth are constantly being exploited for the good-feeling they provide[^1].

nothing needs to be done to get to this place. it's already the direction that we're heading. here on earth, the feeling of dissatisfaction will begin to grow so strong that it'll begin to create this separation naturally. nosebook is already doing it because they refuse to allow people to have the manifestation of good-feeling vision (unless of course they pay for it). there are also countless snake-oil salespeople out there trying to get people to focus on getting the right conditions (divine feminine or to control their thoughts) so they can improve their physical conditions like DNA and well-being and stuff. this isn't the way forward as it's just another set of conditions. perhaps it's a more balanced set of conditions but it's still using conditions to create better conditions without changing the perception which attracted the bad-feeling condition in the first place (it's all attraction).

the sun is also increasing in intensity and this will almost certainly produce a situation which forces people to begin to use their perception to feel good (rather than conditions). I think the increased solar outout is actually a feedback loop. humans want better feeling conditions, and so the sun ramps up the energy output while the custodians push against that energy, causing more desire, so the sun increases its output. this continues on until it novas and starts over. this runaway feedback loop is exactly the opposite of what I think may have been happening during the fall of atlantis. including my theory that the great pyramid was transforming bad-feeling energy into good-feeling energy, and the structure overloaded, but from the sun's perspective, people were creating more and more powerful devices to harness the sun's energy (desire) and this continued to increase but there was no feedback to the sun -- just stronger desire for more energetic conditions.

I believe that the present conditions will continue to accelerate the dissatisfaction on this planet (previous custodians have bred in the #4 types there thereby making the effect much worse) and this is actually the real underlying cause for the nova. I think the flips are physical reasons, but the revversals I'm beginning to believe is our interaction with the sun. more on this another time as I think the solution is to look at capacitors again.

anyway, I think it's easy to see (or, it will be by the height of this solar cycle) how this energy (desire) cannot be quelled in any meaningful way and will continue to grow -- and, pushing against it will only make it worse eventually resulting in an explosion. this is a temporal accumulation of pushing against people from getting capabilities has produced such a big vortex now that it's basically inevitable and an explosion will allow a lot of people to get what they desire while a lot of other people to crash and burn and start over..

---

2. if the sun explodes, then it was the sun's fault. we can blame the for the cataclysm instead of our ability to go up a power level.

the idea here being that we're so incapable of going toward what we want, that we need things outside of ourselves to blame for the things that go wrong. we don't need to ever figure out how to change -- just to keep surviving the onslaught of difficulty that all the out of control conditions are subjecting us to.

while blame is a nice thing to use as a motivating force, it's not effective. this is the root perception involved in the previous reaction -- something that the out of control conditions are responsible for the bad-feeling, not that it's attraction. I get the tangle of contradictory thoughts. whether its me or the sun or whatever that cannot be controlled to produce the conditions desired, it's ...

in the previous reaction, I was basically assuring that the design is to ensure that the people here are capable of feeling good no matter what. the ones that find a way to feel good enough, they can either move to the new earth (if they're chosen[^1][^2]). when I make my transition, I don't know what we'll be capable of by then, but I imagine that we may be able to do selective transferrence of consciousness. like, maybe doing the transfer into a bunch of the boys is the plan. it's so far away, it's too hard for me to tell what that will be like. either way, I'm pretty certain that I'm going to want to continue to gain more and more control over what I am attracting, no matter the conditions -- good or bad.

the whole point of the dual earth idea is that the energy that we're constantly attracting is actually beginning to create stars and planets. this is a continuous flow and balancing between the energies so that we never get feeling too good and neither do the others either. it's no longer about who's better anymore, because it would be like the protron competing with the electron over who is better.

geez, it feels to me like I didn't include enough "edgy" material in this one. sorry for being boring. get used to it though :)

[1]: it may also be sometghing that nosebook wants to do to choose some of these people to become members of the new earth. the incredible conditions there will feel at least twice as good as their present circumstances. maybe they can be exploited in some way because of how good they feel. dunno.

[2]: I can imagine how enticing it would be to acquire a very beautiful person that has figured out how to move all the way up to leadership and get the conditions that they want. I can also imagine how enticing it would be to "save" some struggling kids from such a difficult environment and blow their minds with good conditions -- just ask TLA.

### 2021-07-17 ??:?? - conduct vs. perception
