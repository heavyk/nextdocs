### 2023-02-18 22:41 - invocation of the muse urania

[urania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Countess_of_Montgomery%27s_Urania) is a very formidable work by [lady mary wroth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Mary_Wroth). it has in it a lot of ben jonson type things (4T, foil) in it, I noticed. additionally, it's an epic poem about the loss of paradise invoked by the muse "urania" which says to me that it's probably more of a future prediction, than a retelling of the past.

invocations of the muse happens three times only, urania in book 1 and 4, and "holy light" in book 3.

"God" sounds like a computer system -- a sort of AI, and satan here is playing the foil. it's also interesting that the inv

the battle between lucifer and the good angels... 1/3 of the angels are "good" and they're banished to "hell" (the inner earth).

God made made Man in his image -- inotherwords, we're machines, like God -- so Man is a sort of artificial intelligence (just like God) designed to maintain lower forms of intelligence, ie. the ones without "free will" -- however "will" is desire.

> While God the Father stays in the realm of Heaven, the Son performs the difficult tasks of banishing Satan and his rebel angels, creating the universe and humankind, and punishing Satan, Adam and Eve with justice and mercy.
