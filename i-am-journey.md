# what am I looking for?

I don't really know where to write this one, so I'm just going to make a new section and then wait for inspiration for what to call it.

### 2022-11-17 17:26 - what am I looking for?

today I feel really wierd. there are a number of reasons for it. first, [I wrote about jackson](/blahblog.md#2022-11-16-1005---thinking-about-jackson), and that generated a lot of reactions. yes, I compared him to hitler, as he has a commanding presence about him that is very unnatural. at the moment, he feels pretty bad, and I feel pretty bad for him because if I put him in my mind as if I were to interact with him "he/she said/is like", then the picture I get is making fun of him, kicking him, yelling at him, making fun of him jeering him for being retarded. he attracts a lot of negative feelings and actions from me. it's really weird.

the good thing is I don't have to worry about it. after writeing that entry, there were a lot of reactions, especially considering if I would be voicing my opinion on him and my theory that his imagination is blocked, and also my various theories on why he has such a strong presence about him.

hitler had (has? I feel him in the present) a commnding presence about him very similar to myself and also to jackson. the thing is that hitler used a lot of sex magick and other esoteric rituals to build up an astral presence that overshadowed the awful presence. jackson could easily do this and become very popular with the ladies. my experience has been that females seem to be far more interested in the imaginary, than the the reality,so that could work out pretty good for him, because it's all just a mind game anyway. I've paid a lot of attention to people that hook up, and the more successful ones have this sort of reality distortion field (I think they call it "getting swept off of your feet"), and in any case it's a charisma that gives off a presence that makes one have a strong sense towrard action (just like how he inspires me in my imagination I want to kick, push, make fun of him, etc. it's that same presence/charisma that inspires girls to just blindly go after a guy, that hitler used to convince the germans to go his path.

obviously, I don't really have this charisma -- or, if I do, nosebook has a much stronger influence on people than my charisma does, because I've sent out quite a few emails and stuff with quite a few really engaging ideas and things that I find it very hard to imagine that the only response I got is a fake grasshopper picture from dad. he didn't respond to the emails that are actually things that I want to talk about and instead avoided everything.

obviously, if I actually had good ideas and/or charisma, some people would at least have questions. surely, there was a good idea in there somewhere. it really looks like everyone wants to avoid me as much as possible right now. I've considered beginning to behave very irrationally and see if it starts to attract attention, and to be completely honest, it's not like it's all that weird because you have to see things from my perspective, which is no matter what I do, people will be avoiding me.

---

I've given some thought to why I think peopl are avoiding me, and -- for example, the next day after sending the emails to marc, I noticed a reaction that was particularly strong (noc sure if it came from him), but felt to me like I "read him like a book". I hate that expression, btw, so to clarify it felt to me like he felt like even though there is space and time between us, it felt as if I somehow had an unusual capablity to perceive far beyound -- and it felt like it couldn't hide in the fog of war. the way that marc often plays, is often times much more in response to whatever the player is doing. he likes to get a scout and react to what the opponent is doing, whereas for example when analysing maru's pov, maru didn't really scout. he just makes sure his openings are covered. he uses information that he has on his opponent to his advantage -- so, when he reads my email, he realises that I receive considerably more information than a normal person, and so naturally, from his perspective, it'll look like I'm going to be using that information to my advantage. that's oobviously not the case, because if that were, I would be *miserable*. I receive so much information, I simply *don't care* what others are doing because what others are doing doesn't really mean much to me. I don't usually (or at least I actively inteend *not* to make decisions based on information about another person). I use the information to make extremely relevant commennts and to gain an understanding of the person -- but nothing else. once I understand a person, they become neutral to me. it's only erratic or irrational behaviour that causes me to pay attention more (hence, why I considered beginning to behave erratically to actually begin to start making conversations and talking about concepts that actually interest me).

you can see that for a person like me, all that information is actually a lot like information overload, and since I was young I've been working to incorporate that information into my daily routine as if it's normal, instead of feeling like I need to constantly separate myself from others and go my own way on things. I can't really shut down the information (I've tried), so I've just learned to live with it and just be as chill as possible about everything. I realise that it's not necessarily the best thing to just keep only to myself like I presently do, so I try and integrate as much with people as possible.

I will admit, it is a lot easier to keep to myself when everyone is ignoring me, so I should probably just enjoy it, because I don't have an agenda for other people. I only have an agenda for myself. there are things that *I* want to do, and most of the time, I don't need other people to do them. I'm quite self-sufficient anyway.

I'm reminded of when I was in spain/tuenti and I frequently wanted to just do my own thing, but others would try and integrate me into their parties, etc. in fact, I was such an attractive person that I rarely even needed to initiate a conversation. people just talked to me. lots of people loved me and wanted me to be around them -- even the ones I didn't even really know.

it's a pretty far distance that my charisma has dropped since then, that it must be "supernatural"[^1], and that's the part that's getting to me the most. usually I have to fend off people that want to know more about what new ideas I have on things, that interactions with you guys are all *VERY WEIRD*. it's the <super/un>-natural interactions that are so weird. it's definitely not normal and definitely not natural. it's probably organic.

I spent the first half of my life trying to get away from people because I was so attractive and now the second half, I experience the opposite where I'm no longer attractive/charismatic, and I have all the time that I want to spend away from people.

as a result of realising that I'm now mostly avoided, I've begun to start thinking about what is it that I actually want to *do* with my time.

a few years ago, I waold have responded pretty rapidly to that question with an answer of the website/program that I'm currently infatuated with, but that is no longer the case.

for example, I thought that I wanted to research the carbon and stuff, but if I'm going to have to do it all by myself, it doesn't interest me narly as much. the only thing that I can do is to look at the concepts and render them into text, but it's kind of like talking to a wall if there isn't any opportunity to conduct experiements and actually test out my hypothesis and make updates. that's the fun part. the part of looking at the concept is what I do all day long. it's the same skill to look out with my eyes and identify a tree as it is to look at a concept. it's literally the most boring thing ever.

actually, now that I think about it, I suppose then that marc's perspective is actually one that I like, where I look at a concept, get information and then test out the hypothesis (send an email) and then check the results (the reaction). I do enjoy the interactive process a lot more than just looking. it's kinda like the difference between playing a game or reading a book vs watching a film.

the thing is, back when I was in spain I had unlimited test subjects to try out my ideas on in the bars. I could mess around with people, and then look at the results. nowadays, I don't actually get real results. I'm no longer a person but a camera, and people behave differently around cameras.

---

so to try and get back to my original question of what am I looking for -- again, I don't have an answer.

it may not be about that though. you know, I often times have this sense that this is actually a deciding factor. to illustrate, remember the fatima sightings? there was this weird thing where there was this message that was given, and it was supposed to passed on to the poople (some prophesy or something), but that was like in the 70's or something and the church has refesed to reveal whatever that was in connection to the fatima thing. well, when I first read that, I noticed that this can be looked at like a timeline split where one group of people have an incompatible reality with others. one had the fatima thing revealed and the other had the church refuse to reveal it. if looked at alchemically, this is sort of like distilling the essence to become more and more pure. we're on the timeline with the essence of the most hardcore refusers.

it looks like this is just a continuation of that, and what I'm actually doing (from a larger vantage point) is distilling the that refusal essence, and so actually the point of this timeline is not actually to convince you all with my charisma or presence, but to instead inspire everyone to actually reject me even if they don't want to.

---

I've actually thought about this rejection thing a lot in the context of jackson because I feel that rejection vibe really strongly with him. no matter how open minded or low resistance I am, I *must* reject him. I feel hatred and anger toward him. I absolutely hate him. I hate how he looks because he looks how he feels. he looks stupid, incapable and a waste of a space/person. he is *not* what I'm looking for when it comes to a nephew. I noticed that it's also made me hate jessica as well.

now, I imagine that I have to grow up in jackson's position, and suddenly it becomes a lot easier. from his perspective, he's in an environment, like every child is, which is mostly confusing (at least this is how it was for me). I see myself a lot in him because I too was hideous as a kid and super duper clueless as to what is going on.

it took me A LONG TIME, and I really mean a very long time, to figure out what all of the feelings a concepts that I could feel were. for example, I was quite prepared to talk to remi that one time because I had so much experience with others telling me the things that I see/feel is wrong because they want to keep their fog of war. this was most intense with raquel, and really, her decision to not talk to me about any of the things that I could clearly see, felt very similar to the situation that I'm in now. I knew that trying to have a relationship with a person that is always telling me that the things I'm seeing and feeling are not reality. it was at that moment that I knew that the relationship was over. this is how I am; take it or leave it.

so, because I didn't actually start to figure out my emotional/conceptual capacity and start to make sense of all the chaos of emotions and information that I regularly receive until after raquel (when I was 29-30yo), I really mean that it took me A LONG TIME.

---

if I could have developed that capacity earlier on in my life, that would have been great, but I think it would have actually brought me even more isolation. nobody (cept me perhaps) likes to be around other people capable of hearing/feeling my thoughts. I'm not telepathic. I don't hear your thoughts; I have much much more than that. for me an entire concept is presented any time that anyone thinks about anything with any amount of emotion attached to it. I actually am the best listener, because I'm not listening to the words, but paying attention to the concept. I actually *can* understand people and see things from their perspective.

you know, you guys can see through my eyes, but I'm fairly certain that I see your perspective better than you see mine. just because you can see what I'm looking at doesn't mean you see it the same way I do, and you definitely don't get all of that extra information that I get.

this is very frightening to some people. it looks like I'm distilling the most hardcore refusers -- this is the ooposite, other end of the corkscrew of the "lust for results" or "need the manifestation to feel good types". that's a funny translation of that concept, btw. I originally intended to write "foot-draggers" but, I felt instead that I would look at the active side of the concept (someone who is aware of the lust for results), vs the passive side of the concept (foot dragging).

the other way to look at it is, this is a ploy to get me to try and come to meet you guys at your vibration by trying to get me to engage you guys -- when really, what I want is for the others that are cool with someone who is good at conceptual viewing, to meet me at that vibration, and all the ones that refuse to engage with someone with extra sensory perception. come to where I am.

THAT'S WHAT I WANT!! I got it! (no two trips are the same time)

[1]: I also hate the word "supernatural" as well cause everything is natural -- but I use the word on purpose because it's absolutely *not natural* at all for me to have such radical swings in my charisma, sometimes even within the hour. it *has* to be something other than natural that's causing it.
