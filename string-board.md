# special k(id)'s string board

### 2022-05-10 21:45 - intro

a few days ago I was asking the question, "why" (see @[blahblog](2022-05-09 14:55)) and I ended the entry with a song called "supermode - tell me why". in addition to that I was listening to snake-bros #027 "pillars of enoch" where they (now russ, you are "they") were talking about the "why" -- well, earlier on in the episode they were discussing sean carroll. I went on to his website and he suggested a book called, "the book of why" dana mackenzie and judea pearl. I read part of the introduction and the book goes wayyyy over my head.

I believe the problem is that they put these formulas down with these symbols which mean things to them, and in their brains, it appears that these symbols are viewed and their entire meaning is understood and then they can then just use the shorthand letter and that letter is just a placeholder for everything that symbol "means". I do not "see" anything in my head, and so therefore I don't actually "see what they mean to say" -- so I have to approach the concept from a different perspective.

the only time I've ever seen something similar to the way their brains operate was with my interactions with the "reality technicians" when eating mushrooms. they would show me a glowing orb (a kind of symbol), and then forevermore I knew that symbol, and from then on that symbol took on many different forms and I saw it in many examples in my life, and so then by life experience these symbols came to life for me and I "knew" them through experience. once I had the knowledge of these symbols I could cause them to interact with other concepts and produce new concepts.

I learned a lot about this type of symbolic interaction with a concept producing a lot of other concepts in my life that would then begin to illumiate this symbol further when I went to spain. especially the women, but the men as well take in data sorta like statistics does (the data becomes enumeration of actions of the symbol which is usually a person or a government entity) and then thes data points when interacting with concepts, "mean something". these symbols become the main characters in stories and are then exaggerated to a point to where they become a "personaje" and that pattern which the personaje performs follows them around and you could say with a very high statistical certainty that personaje is related to those types of actions.

anyway, that isn't what I wanted to say. what I wanted to say is that I want to go back and read the book a little better, cause it calls me. so I'll do something I've always wanted to try, which is take something I don't understand and then turn the feeling/concept it gives me into something tangible (ie. repeat what I understood they wrote, but in my own words).

---

long intro. this blog is inspired by that because we all have these random symbols pass through our lives and they "mean" something to us, but there is no way that these meanings could have any statistical relevance to anything.

we all get fixated on these weird "syncs" that happen (like the why question) all at once, and in my experience, they forever alter my trajectory through life. there's no way they could ever possibly mean anything at the time, but on hindsight, they seem to stand out. I'm going to begin to chronicle them here.

I'm willing to let it all hang out and show people that they're not weird for thinking that "random" occurances which "mean something" get mistaken for "why" :)

by the end of this, you'll see that I'm a very "special" kid that has a problem of seeing everything as symbolically interconnected. it's a real problem that I have, cause I bring a lot of disaster on myself by looking to symbols for the "guidance" rather than trusting my emotions.

also, by the end of this, I hope to illustrate how very different of a perspective it is to have difficulty seeing where "I" begin and end in my experience; is everything just a reflection of my own mentation? why?

### 2022-05-10 22:11 - that mustache feeling

in @[blahblog](2022-05-10 16:52), I made the case that I wanted to let a girl find her connection and then attract me, that way *I would be a reflection of her desire*. when I wrote that, suddenly eva (my neighbour popped into my mind). I noted this down and when I was doing so, I thought also about zaryn's ex in spain as well (don't know her last names). I didn't think much about it, because the idea I had in my head was that it would probably be one of the girls that's using one of my bodies that will find their connection, not so much one of the younger ones, cause how can you find your connection (without conducive conditions), with a barely developed brain. it takes a bit to learn how to use one's perception to feel the way one wants to feel, and so what I was meaning is that one of those girls using my bodies has a *much* better chance at finding their connection with all those good physical conditions around. they have the exact opposite problem that I have and only need a slight capacity to perceive things the way they want to, to get it. it's really easy.

anyway, after that, I turned on "the tick" and it was "s03e01 - that mustache feeling", and in it tick wakes up one morning with a mustache. remember, tick is already a woman in a boy's body, but me has a lot of feminine qualities, like no package, and never any facial hair. this time he has a mustache and so he breaks into a whole song complete with 90's rap about how great his mustache is, and tells the guys at the diner that now he finally he can describe himself as "rugged, self-assured, adult". "it says to the world, I'm a man of action; but action tempered with maturity" arthur is super frustrated and annoyed at tick for his mustache.

---

OK, for me tick is a symbol of me, and arthur is nosebook in general. he represents the constantly worrying brains which have to keep coming up with new ideas to get me and them out of trouble that I get them into. I don't really know who the others really represent[^1], but when it came to the scene with "special angent jim rage", I immediately associated him with mr. motor.

special agent rage is a part of a non-existant portion of the government that lost funding, and he's on a personal mission to get rid of this mustache. he's got 3 vivacius, exciting, talented beauticians, which reminded me a lot of the song, "armand van helden - my my my" which also has three girls in it of the similar colour (black, brown, and white).

anyway, the mustache has fallen in love with a russian beard.

---

at the end of @[blahblog](2022-05-09 14:55), I put in the supermode song and then watched the video a little bit later. I remember seeing the video a long time ago and it's the same as all the other trance videos coming out of germany at the time -- so I didn't notice anything special about it. this time I noticed that there were two dudes. one was red and one is white. the red one drives a white car and the white one drives a red car. I can't quite figure out what happens in the middle of the video, but one of them has trouble with their car and a blond girl in blue jumps into the race and beats the red and white ones.

I noticed the symbolism and pointed out that they're telling a story here and related it to egypt. upper egypt is white (bowling pin hat) and lower egypt is red (champagne bucket), and they were united for a while, red driving white and white driving red. however when akhenaten came into power, the hats changed and suddenly a blue hat that looks like a longhead starts to appear. I believe the egyptian hats are symbols of bloodlines, and there are a lot of flags with red white and blue in them, but the USA is the most symbolic with the red and white on the periphery with blue in the core (you know where the stars are[^2]). in egypt, this blue colour symbolised a female bloodline that descended from the daughters of akhenaten.

anyway, the racing part reminded me of the song "cake - going the distance" -- a song about a guy who is going the distance, going for speed (this is symbolic of me) and all the while he's doing this "she's in her time of need" (so he this distance dude is leaving the girls when they "need" (evolution-of-desire) him the most). OK, so when noticing the two boys lose to the girl in blue, it was obvious to me that this was a sign that it would be a girl that wins the race, not either of the boys.

I noted the flags have those same colours and mistakenly thought that the russian flag had red and white on the bottom and blue on the top. I looked it up and actually that's the flag of a small district in germany I'd never heard of. the only flags that had blue in an elevated or core position is norway (blue cross surrouneded by white and then red on the periphery).

the russian mistake caught my eye because the mustache (which represents to me the girls that are using my bodies) is actually in love with a russian beard. I don't know what that could possibly mean, as it could potentially imply a lot of things.

weird connection there.

anyway, so back to the episode: at the end the mustache drags sewer urchin by the upper lip out to meet with the russian beard and rage is stopped from destroying the mustache by the tick. it's revealed that the department lost its funding so the three girls bail on him. the tick then does a monologue about how love is cool and jim rage had all of the really cool stuff and the three girls, but he wasn't cool. the tick lost the thing that made him cool (the mustache), and he didn't gain a thing.

so the next episode is "the little wooden boy and the belly of *love*" -- where tick has to burn his wooden friend to get them out of the whale.

I had something else I wanted to write but that's enough "why" for now.

---

final thing I noticed: in the "my my my" song, it's full of questions, but they never ask why. they ask "what" as in "where's it going to go" (what's going to happen), and "how" did it get to the state that was never meant ("neuroticfish - mechanic of the sequence" reference)

[1]: I don't associate sewer urchin and deflater-mouse to anyone in particular, but they would probably be my friends, so I see a little bit of chris in sewer urchin, and daniel in deflater-mouse -- though they really could be anyone

[2]: the stars are symbolic to me because I think of girls as stars and boys more as planets, and in my idea where we go along optimising ourselves to maximise energy, I think of the idea of when the sun goes supernova/quasar, the girls concept will get attracted so rapidly to the sun, they would tear through it attracting all of the stuff that resonates with their concept, and they'd emerge on the other side as a tiny star. continuing to attract hydrogen and spew out more dense materials, they'll gain size and higher density planets into orbit with them. the blue ones are the future stars.

### 2022-05-11 02:13 - symbols are why

I've had a lot of interesting reactions to @[string-board](2022-05-10 21:45), and one of those is that I'm somehow critisising the book of why just because I don't understand it and it's far over my head. actually, that's not the case at all.

I realised that my form of thinking is exactly backwards to theirs as I was trying to figure out how to assimilate their concepts. they begin the intro by explaining the mantra that "correlation is not causation" with the example that the rooster will make a sound around the time of the sunrise, but the rooster does not cause the sunrise. well, that's probably true, but that's no more true than the sunrise causing the rooster to make a sound -- and so they stress that there is association between those events, but neither event causes the other event to happen, rather that statistically, there is a statistically higher likelyhood of events happening together.

I get all of that cause that's intro to statistics stuff, but I had a very difficult making the connection from statistical associations and correlations to "why". they gave a flowchart of a machine learning loop as an example of how to begin to make the connection between association and why, with some extra data analysis steps in there to filter out unlikely correlation. at that point, I sorta glazed over and I couldn't track with them conceptually so I resolved to take another look at it later.

in the meantime, I tried to get into their heads a bit and figure out how they think, to figure out why I found the last part so difficult to *feel* -- as in I lost the capacity to feel the concept they were emanating, which means there is an incompatibilty in our thinking process. I get into people's heads to figure out *how* they think, not *why* or *what* they think. for me the what is inconsequential as that's always going to reflect the condition of their environment. the why usually has to do with past experience, but it's the *how* which reveals the underlying form of perception that arrives them to their conclusions.

so, when I got into their heads, I noticed that this logic process was very visual for them and they could move around and perform operations using these symbols, and it's not the results that mean something, but the symbols themselves have meaning. they have "P" on the paper and I see a letter. as a comuputer programmer I know it's a function with paramaters, and that function returns a value, but it felt like for them, that P was not a function but a *meaning*. another variable may be "persons who ..." and that could be represented by a letter "d" (for example), and again, I see the letter d, and I know it's a variable containing a value, but again as a computer programmer, this is just a value somewhere on the stack in the microprocessor -- a simple scalar -- but again, it felt to me that their version of that letter had a lot more meaning to it -- as in it's the "right" data, and not just a number.

for me, functions accept inputs of certain types and return a value of another certain type. I don't place any importance on the meaning of the data going into the function, because the data going into the function for me is not a number but a feeling (a concept). the function for me is the symbol. it's the archetype that is performing the operation on the concept/feeling -- and so therefore it's possible to detect seemingly connected concepts (cause they feel similar as an output of the operation) that don't appear to have any statistical connection between them.

I'm not saying they're wrong or right, but that I'm completely backwards from their style of thinking. I see connections between a cartoon, two songs, and a 2-3kya empire. I'm more like marshall mcluhan than a statistician in my form of thought, because I recognise that it's the "how" (the medium) that is the message, not the the "what" (data, statistics) or the "why" (what this book tries to explain).

obviously don't know much about the why yet, which is why I'm so recently enfatuated with it. I'm excited to learn more about the science of why as I continue on with this book.

---

hrm, that wasn't the conclusion I wanted to end on. so here comes the second segment:

for me the whole of everything feels to me in one way or another. I know that "feels to me" is bad english, but it's a phrase that exists in spanish but not in english. when I want to say I like something in english, I say, "I like this". in spanish, it's, "this thing likes to me" -- and the best way to describe that in english is "this thing resonates with me". learning the reflective verb of gustar helped me to understand this concept in a way that finally made sense to me.

the subconscious realisation that verb has is that every time I say I like something, it brings it *to* me. I suppose there is a verb "odiar" but in general things that I don't like just become, "no me gusta a mi" (it doesn't like to me) or "a mi, no me gusta" (in my opinion, it doesn't like to me) -- which illustrates a very big flaw in spanish interaction -- which is that the phrase feels like the thing (which I don't resonate with) isn't going to me, or even that it's going away from me -- when that's not the case at all.

time and again, I saw people complaining about the same crap over and over again because they kept "(not) liking it to them" by "not liking it (to them)" -- and so what I'm getting at here is that the for them, they would perceive things much more similar to how I see things in that you have an archetype/personaje (like a "pijo" or a "kani" or a "chulo") and their actions get simplifed down into data points which mean something like "vendiendo hielo a los penguinos", "bebiedo a tope", "chuleria", etc. and that fits their profile. "why" do they do they behave like that? because that's what's expected of them. they fit their profile.

once I got identified as a profile, then they accept me. this was largely one of the biggest reasons for my such heavy drinking -- because I was a daily heavy drinker just like most of the rest of them. I showed up to work buzzed, rebuzzed during lunch, and after work was drinks again. in their system, they could fit me into one of their boxes, and so then they could accept me. often times I fit into so many of their boxes, they considered me essentially "spanish". it's a very accepting culture, once they have a way to relate to you. also, as long as you retained some relatable aspect, they would then let you be free to do whatever -- but I always had to have a flaw which allowed them to see me fitting into a category.

I said all of that because I used their symbolic representation of a person to kind of slip through the cracks of reality in their system. because I figured out their system, I could be whatever to anyone or nobody to someone else. they used image (clothes, suit, etc) and words (dialect, and forms of expression) to construct and maintain an image to the public. in private it could change, but it was just another image. I wore the same clothes pretty frequently and didn't really try to make an image for myself that way. I tried using my words to create an image but I was always "puto yanki/junki" in my words so instead I constructed my image entirely virtually by changing how I related to people. the aspects I showed them would classify me as one archetype, and I didn't have to change my appearance or even my behaviour. I just changed what symbol they saw when they looked at me or thought about me. it's very hard to describe this capacity -- but I sorta just look at me from their point of view (I probably acquired this capacity from patricia[^1]) and then see myself as a symbol of whatever.

I quickly realised that I didn't really care what symbol people perceived me as and sorta gave up on the impression and the entire charade and went back to the states. in reality, all of the things that I could see myself as (through the eyes of other people) were useless because nobody saw me for me -- for who I really was -- not even me. this was around the time of the arrival of nosebook and I realised that even with so many people with so much access to me, they *still* didn't see me for me -- and neither did I, *still*..

I used to derive a lot of meaning out of the "syncs" that would constantly happen around me, thinking they were sort of like signs or directions to send me in ways that I should go. what I didn't realise is that I was the one seeing those symbols and I was the one that was attracting them -- both the things that liked to me and the things that didn't like to me, equally. and I would recognise them both and say, "oh I've seen this before so I know what's coming next". I did this just recently (@[blahblog](2022-05-09 09:38)) when I said that the project didn't feel like the previous times when something was about to dramatically alter my physical conditons, but it felt natural and logical and obvious that it'll be what happens next.

how do I know what'll happen next? well, that's the thing. it feels the same as the spanish person expecting chuleria from some douchebag. it feels obvious that it's what's coming next. I can't really convey into words how it is but the successful operations that these symbols have on concepts (concepts are just the particles, not the wave) form a sort of web of pathways where some are more likely than others.

why are they more likely? because the "known" operations the symbols perform on the concepts are "why".

---

I'm hoping to illuminate these ideas a little more as I continue on with this book, but I felt like I should write out the way I see it first and clear up a few things.

I even see things like the date for this entry as meaningful: 02:13 or (0,+2)(+l,3). it's four unique sequential numbers, and the intervals as well. I love the symmetry between them too being two groups of two numbers two distant from each other.

what I've noticed is that people who see connections all over the place are considered to be less intelligent or something like that, but I've noticed that a lot of really brilliant people see connections all over the place and that creates an open-mindedness which allows for more "syncs" to happen.

so what I'm trying to say is that for those people who see those connections, the things that those connections mean to them become automatically much more likely.

the last conclusion here (I know that this is the third one), is that this sort of symbolic system creates a lot of rigidity because it's very difficult to exit from the boxes that others put you in ... however, I aim to begin to show that once you know how to game the system, the system of symbolic expectation makes new and unexpected (statistically very unlikely) things to become very easy to pull off.

I'm reminded of the card where I illustrated my hemispheres personified as symbols on to paper and many people were sure that it meant whatever. well, surity that it means someting (even from someone else) adds energy into the equation and in the end, what finally manifests is what it means to you. skerptards are your worst "enemy" but also your "biggest supporter" as well. so put your friends into ridiculous boxes and then allow that symbol to manifest into something different than expected.

[1]: as I was editing that just now, I was reminded of michiel's wife which I think may have also been named patricia, too. very strange. I never noticed that connection before. I wonder if he too picked up a similar capacity from her. that would be ultra "coincidence".

### 2022-05-11 13:41 - antimemes and hiding things in plain sight

I'm listening to snake-bros #029 now and russ is talking about antimemes -- the opposite of a meme, is an idea that does not want to be retained in memory or propagated.

it's kinda cool because last night I ended talking about how skerptards are your greatest enemy if you believe them, "pffffft, no dude that's just random correlation / coincidence", but they're also your greatest supporter if you believe you (doesn't matter what they believe).

kyle brought up a really great example of the cathedral, and in it he showed how they seemingly give "information overload" and so you go away with a sense of awe, but no specific memory of any of the exact symbols. then russ added to that with another great example of the commisioners of the cathedral getting the most awesome structure, but the builders of the cathedral told their (sacred geometry as divinity) story with the symbols of the religion, and because they're somewhat compatible, the church people are so blinded by church symbols memes that they miss the underlying antimeme that holds their whole meme together.

---

so I thought about it and the concept of an antimeme is easily explainable if we think of an antimeme as any concept which is incompatible with the person's perception. all radio signals are antimemes to us, because they're there and we could be looking right at them (like his 411 monster) but we simply don't see them because they're not compatible with our perception. if you trained your eyes to see certin frequencies of the EM spectrum, you could start to see some of those previously invisible things (antimemes).

---

this is a beautiful example of what I was talking about with the symbols -- because they're there and so many people see the surface appearance (the hero on a horse, the dragon, the prince and princess,kingdom, etc.) but in reality, those symbols *mean* something to you, and so they have to be believable enough for someone to look at it and say, "yep, that's real" for them to believe it to become real.

imagine for a moment the movie, "encanto" -- and the story has all of these characters with their flaws and interactions that seem real enough that you totally miss that the house has a personality, is driving the story, and that it's totally impossible -- and so I leave that film thinking, "yep, seems plausible". other people focus on the house saying, "houses can't move things around like that -- the house would have to have positional antigravity pulses and an AI capable of responding to suscinct interactions grasping the meaning of what's inferred by the person's desire for 'help'" -- and those people would totally miss the symbols in the characters personalities, believing them to be "real enough" or "not nearly as problmatic as the idea of a magical house" -- so they consider the characters to be real.

no matter how one perceives the film, one part is the antimeme and the other is the meme. most people probably went away remembering all of of the characters, songs, and animation. for me, the film was like the cathedral in the information overload sense.

I've trained myself to not get so fixated on the overwhelming amount of detail by fixating on single details so I can subconsciously. I picked this trick up from "monk" the tv series where he would go around counting things and touching the tops of poles to keep is mind fixated on a simple detail so that he doesn't get information overload[^1] -- meanwhile subconsciously he's absorbing every detail and can revit it later with his photographic memory.

I don't have photographic memory, so I capture the essence of everything that I come into contact with. for example, to reply to a reaction of how I absorbed so much of that intro when I only barely read it, is because I applied this same principle. I fixated my mind on how over my head all of these crazy formulas are so I could subconsciously pick up the essence of the book without having to expend too much effort to try and figure out all of the weird forms of expression they were using.

I have so much more to say about this, but I don't yet know how to present it, so I'll just wait for the next event which gives me an excuse to write about it...

[1]: I believe this is also what tesla was doing when he was out in public in order to distract himself from the torrent of other wierd feelings that everyone else was putting out. he was highly sensetive so he spent most of his time inside of his inner world, but when he had to be externally focused around a lot of other people, he had to have a mania to distract him.

### 2022-05-12 20:20 - blowhard the long-distance leviathan

I want to write something, but I don't know what I want to write.

I just watched s03e01 - the little wooden boy and the belly of love. I might move this over to string-board, but for now I'm just blabbing cause I want to write. I noticed that ever since @[string-board](2022-05-10 22:11), where I mentioned that I find arthur to be symbolic of nosebook in general, now I see him completely differently.

this time when I watched it, I noticed new things. for example, let's say that arthur is nosebook, and carmelita's father is tesla -- the one who made their flying suits and many other devices -- well, he says he had invented a lot of things and decided he wanted to walk across the country when he got swallowed up by a whale. he didn't seem desperate to get out, and the tick reveals at the end that they were in "the belly of love".

in @[string-board](2022-05-10 22:11), I noted that there said that love is cool, tick's mustache made him cool, but the mustache just used him to get the beard the mustache was in love with.

in this episode arthur falls in love with carmelita and wants to spend time with her instead of being a sidekick to tick. OH, maybe arthur isn't so much nosebook in general but actually more like the "landscape architect" or something like that, because tick gets them into situations all the time because he thinks like he's invincible, so then arthur has to find a way to bail them out of the situation -- though it seems that tick always finds his way out of everything anyway, so arthur is mostly saving himself.

anyway, carmelita is a really weird character because arthur really likes her, saying things like, "we've barely just met but it feels like I've known you my whole life". the episode also has this feeling like she's trying to seduce him for some reason, but really all she wants to do is to figure out the codes her father (tesla) wrote in the notebook, which the decoder is inside of arthur's flying suit.

the tick get pissed that arthur is leaving him alone because he's in love with carmelita. tick is funny because he wants to do crappy "hobbies" with arthur, but they're like the worst hobbies (crafts) ever, like a macaroni duck, so now that arthur is gone, he decides to make his own sidekick out of his own craft which is the little wooden boy and then proceeds to go on patrol (ie. looking for crime/trouble). somehow the wooden boy hears the plight of arthur and carmelita's encounter with the above-the-law espionage crew, so the tick sounds the battlecry and goes to help them.

the three swiss industrial espionage guys (and one girl) try to take the notebook from arthur, and in the process arthur has to nearly undress fully. he says, "this is the most humiliating thing I've ever ..."

so let's say that there is a sort of city state (like the swiss) that is sort of "above the law" like the USA is, and they've nearly figured out how to recreate tesla's world system -- well, then this sort of industrial espionage would most certainly be the most humiliating thing, because then at that point they could tune into the physical experience of any person or animal on planet earth. nosebook wouldn't have any secrets at all.

they get the book and the decoder in arthur's flying suit and he goes to stop them. he flys out to get the swiss guy with no pants on and manages to stop him and get the book and his pants back by pinching the swiss guy's nose with tweezers (huh?) even though carmelita doesn't think he will succeed with tweezers. after he succeeds, she flys up to hug him in mid-air for (I suppose) getting the book back.

so she's hugging him in mid-air, the swiss falls to the ground and tick congratulates the little wooden boy for his hard work (the little wooden boy fights hilda, the only female swiss). arthur and carmelita are sharing a moment together in mid-air when "blow hole the legendary long-distance leviathan" (you know, the "he's going the distance, he's going for speed, she's all alone in her time of need" leviathan).

blow hole (which I always think of as "blow hard") makes a trip across the country every 10y (apparently). this is his second time going across the country[^1]. the first tour (2018) I crushed the hippies' dreams (sorry no drugs and sex), and then the next time I go for it (2028), is this the the time of this industrial espionage setup? blowhard captures the reporter, "sally vacuum" in the middle of her news coverage of him and takes her along; she wants to know where he sees himself in 10y (cause presumably he'll make another trip across the country again, then).

I suppose that blowhard is actually significant of my pontification. it's possible that nosebook makes some of my pontification/ideas difficult to find, and so from time to time, something happens and somebody discovers one of the hard to find bits, which then "goes viral" and spread by word of mouth "across the country".

so the whale is my message and at the core of it is carmelita's father (tesla). tick sees that carmelita and arthur are going to be swallowed up by blowhard and runs to catch them, getting swallowed as well. carmelita's father tells the tick that he has to burn his new sidekick to get out of blowhard the long-distance leviathan.

P.S. I was even pontificating about whales this morning, too.

[1]: so, if we consider that fwh said I have till 2038 and I came to the country in 2017, but I didn't really get settled in till 2018, that's exactly 20y, so that means that they seem to happen in intervals of every 10y, so 2018, 2028, then 2038 I'm gone.

### 2022-05-12 22:48 - USB

I don't really know what to do about this, but I remember I was out picking weeds on remi's driveway and found a quarter. paul offered me $25 and I found 25 cents -- so that's $5^2 and 5^2 cents. I thought that was cool. my memory is all jumbled around there, but it reminded me of janine bolon's book which I can't remember now but it made me think of a really funny "get rich quick" scheme: "making sense out of your dollars" ... with a slogan something like, "if by the end of this seminar, you aren't making cents out of your dollars, full money-back guarantee"

I was having a good laugh at that when I can't remember if it came before that event or after but I transported back to a dream a long time ago that I titled "adam and eve's dream". I just searched the archive and I can't find the dream for some reason. it may be one of the things my computer crashes were designed to erase. so cause I can't find it, I'll relay the dream again because it's gone now and it left a pretty good imprint on me.

in the dream, I remember there was something that was going to happen; I interpretted it as a cataclysm and everyone was preparing to get off of the earth or something.

the scene suddenly changed and now I'm in a foreign place and it looks sorta similar to earth, and there are these metallic buildings with supplies in them -- which I presumed to be preparations for the coming cataclysm.

the very first thing I noticed is how dark everything was. as in, there was barely any sunlight at all and there was way less ... I don't know what to call it, but it's that invisible colour that I "see" which I describe as being a part of people's aura or an element of the ether[^1]. in the dream I noticed there was basically nobody around, so I figured that was why there was all that missing inivisible colour that I usually see.

so, it's much darker than usual and there are these metal buildings with food supplies in them. there's basically no humans around anywhere but I don't feel danger. I just think they all left the earth to escape the cataclysm (something about going into a portal). I don't feel cold or warmth either -- just sorta normal -- but there's a tremendous amount of emptiness and space around me. it felt kinda like I was one of the only people there on earth because everyone had left. I don't remember plants, but it seemed like there was some form of vegitation. other than that, I notice there are a whole bunch girls that are there with me -- like a lot of them.

I really had this sense that it was just me and the girls and everyone else had peaced out. when I woke up I didn't feel anything particularly strong -- neither excitement or trepidation. it was just sorta what was happening. it felt clear to me that we were sort of starting from the beginning. it's for that reason that I labeled it "adam and eve's dream"

---

so I'm out on the driveway and I have this strong sense/reaction to something from nosebook where they are realising that I'm a rapidly accelerating problem that they need to get rid of. I just wrote @[blahblog](2022-05-12 13:38) and explained to jaron the idea of a dynamic meme designed to infect the human concept (half of the idea I told to jaron and the other half is written in blahblog), so the reaction was in relation to that, and they realised that it was getting harder and harder to contain me concepts and keep them from "going viral" (blowhard making a trip across the country?) and they were realising that there's no real good place to send me. I'm becoming a problem to their entire charade.

as I had that reaction, I had the realisation that if I just keep holding out, eventually I become such a problem that they have to send me to another planet. I then flashed into "adam and eve's dream" and realised that the reason why it was so dark is because I was on pluto.

I forget how much longer after that, I had another reaction and in this one, now I am in the spot of enki and I had designed the "adamu" to do all of this work in the field toiling and doing the weed picking, but the corrupted brotherhood had forced enki to never be able to find his connection again -- and here I (remember I'm enki in this vision/reaction experience) and I'm picking weeds and doing the labour now that he had designed the adamu to do because the annunaki were complaining about having to do the labour and stuff -- cept I'm not complaining about it. I said all of that to explain that the reaction was to emphasise a connection between enki and adamu switching places. I repeated the snake-bros sign-off phrase, "good night adamu; get back to work"

so putting all of the pieces together, does that mean if I continue to hold off on everything they throw at me, are they gonna have to ship us off-planet??? wow... that's a pretty good sized cucumber already, if that's the case. lol

(USB is a reference to jaron's comment today when I told him he can put bill and ted's excellent adventure on a usb memory. he said there's US plan A: USA -- and there's US plan B: USB)

[1]: for example, in places like discotecas or concerts, I see TONS of this invisible colour because there's such a density of people with strong emotions. it's related to emotions and it's stronger the more people feel around me.

### 2022-05-15 22:29 - quixote (first impression)

I was watching s02e02 - alone together, and I noticed some symbols in it. they're going to fix up the chairface chipendale's moon graphiti and there was a bit about the "quixote" probe. I've always wondered what the don quixote story was, so I went off looking to see what it could be. I started to read the synopsis on wikipedia and I started to get a sensation that a lot of the symbols seem very familar to me -- as in they sort of resonate with my life.

it's not uncommon for a person to see theirself in the symbols of a story, and actually it's probably the normal thing to do (though I don't know for certain). putting symbols into a story which are approachable by people is a very common thing.

---

one of the things that I've heard very often from people is that I don't see what I'm supposed to see. they see something mundane and ordinary yet I see something entirely different. it's as if I see things that are not there all the time. I think now my vision is a lot more controlled, but that happened with people's physical appearance and also with the picture that their words would paint. I just see a different thing and it's often times the exact opposite of what everyone else sees.

I used to blunder through life blaming and accusing people of things ...

---

jaron just told me good night and we got into a conversation abou highly-motivated people, so it's funny how the conversation I just had with him was about the subject that I was just going to write about...

I used to be a highly-motivated person, and I had these ideas that I wanted to *do*, and so I would go around and blame people for preventing me from doing them.

(I just wrote out the highly-motivated concept, and you can see how don quixote is a sort of comical, exaggerated version of that).

---

lots of chaos with the symbols, so I want to end this, but before I do, when I was reading about it, I noticed that part two of the book (which was written 10y later, like the return of blowhole), apparently (from what wikipedia said), the second part has a lot of new elements that become themes of the "modern novel" with character exploration, rather than just a bunch perfect chivalry knights doing awesome stuff. so more introspection and analysis on the personality than just an enumeration of nobility and the noble actions that they perform.

as I was reading that, it occurred to me that part two feels a lot like a timeline edit on cervantes part, which together with shakespere, seemed to derail the 1600's enlightenment period and turn us once again (in the sciences) to a more materialistic analysis, but on the character level, we're more "human" rather than just a bunch of arrogant (but enlightened) douchebags running the show.

ever since [writing my thoughts on "forms of life"](/forms-of-life/thoughts.md) where I noted how about 400ya, on the subject of species, we deleted the concept world and turned it into physical-reality-is-everything world.

it seems that this is also tied to the "s02e06 - bloomsday", "400 year bloom" where the plant is about to bloom, but it has to be held away from blooming "in the bad way" by playing it music. they have a few close calls, where it almost blooms, but "american maid" sings "my country tis of thee" and another american classic which I can't remember now. it starts getting really big and starts to bloom again but the tick sings "la donna e movile" to it to prevent the bloom.

I believe these songs are symbols of different aspects of things that we have been put into place to refocus us so that the flower (which represents humankind), doesn't "bloom in the bad way". or, seen from the leapfrogging-time-pickles perspective, these are self-sabotage events that happened.

imagine for a moment that the renaissance produced a golden age (a split that this timeline didn't have) and they figured out that there was a split, so having sufficient techology or perception they figured out how to tune into the other split (our timeline) and so all of the great enlightened ones (shakespere, cervantes, lope de vega, and many more) purposefully sabotaged their own art so that it changed the focus on to the character of the person, "beingness" versus status (as in, ser/estar, ser vivo/estado), and so on this timeline the great artists played a different music to prevent the 400y bloom from happening "in the bad way".

### 2022-05-18 22:58 - arthur and little wooden boy

I watched "s01e01 - the idea men" tonight and I noticed one thing which I don't know what it means, but in the intro, the tick says that he and arthur are not two men, "we are ten men". interesting.

anyway, I've noticed that arthur is always right-handed, though tick is usually left-handed. so, I was thinking about maybe the idea that arthur symbolises my left hemisphere and the tick the right, cause I had some reactions to the "little wooden boy" in that regard. I don't believe arthur symbolises my right side because his most notable characteristic is worry which is not something I do a lot of. he also has a flying moth suit, made by an inventor. I don't fly, and if I did, I would fly, not because I had a suit, but because I felt like I could fly.

I believe that some people at nosebook have ramped up their energy levels to a point where they can fly, so it's a device (something external to them) which gives them the capability. in one episode tick tries to convince arthur to carry him (manouvere 14C I think), but arthur doesn't think it'll work. I just don't really fit arthur's archetype.

arthur also in the grail quest, is the king which is searching for the grail (ie karmalita), and if he finds the grail (the female bloodline that increases the vitality of and heals the land), again, that's not me at all. the idea there is that if the king is good and just, then things will prosper and it'll go toward a golden age -- but, as I explained in quixote, that grail quest of knights and chivalry is a bunch of bunk, and quixote's optimism to a golden age only illustrated his delusion -- meaning, we're in the sabotage, so no golden age. the timeline where they went off and had their golden age exists and I believe it is them (we/me) that have influenced this timeline (self-sabotage) so that nobody gets connected (ie finds the grail), because that does create a golden age, but it also creates a cataclysm at the peak of the golden age.

I'm not searching for material things to give me flight or want to create a golden age. I believe that all of those external things that the golden age symbolises can and should be realised from within, so that you attract what's wanted rather than attracting a cataclysm at the hight of awesomeness (like the belt in s03e04). your awesomeness doesn't come from a material thing (like a belt) but from belief in oneself. I align much more with tick in that regard. in that first episode, tick tells arthur is time for him to start believing in himself.

I rest my case on that regard.

there is one objection to that, which is that tick is muscular externally as a sort of reflection of how he thinks, yet arthur is sorta pudgy as a reflection of how he thinks ("not in the face! not in the face!"). well, if I were to be let go so that I actually feel the way I really feel, I'm pretty certain that I would quickly gain a perfect body like the tick's.

instead, I'm tuned to feeling like someone who's pudgy would feel (which is probably how many subcribers to my perception feel), I take in the way that they feel and then find a way to feel good anyway. I notice that I'm constantly making tons of improvements. I may have a pudgy body now, but give me a few years and it'll start to look really good. why? because despite the numerous setbacks, I'm constantly finding ways to feel better, so I'm kinda finding ways to feel better faster than they can find ways to cause me to feel worse. eventually I'll outpace their capabilities and you'll notice my body getting way way more attractive, simply because I've gotten so good at feeling the way I want.

to prove my point, it's probably the case that many of the nosebook guys would get pretty pudgy if they sat around all day like me, and potentially look even worse, but they use artificial techniques to improve their strength and appearance (symbolised by the belt).

---

so finally we come to the little wooden boy. imagine for a moment that carmelita (little brown one) is symbolic of andrea, and they sorta get infatuated with her and her father's inventions which give them abilities like flight. arthur is telling carmelita that he thinks that the tick felt threatened by her, and it jumps over to the tick sad saying something that I completely disagree with (kinda), "you know little wooden boy, the worst sin in the world is disloyalty".

loyalty is sorta in the same vein as @[blahblog](2022-05-18 21:27) where I talk about doing what I feel like doing. if I'm loyal to someone, I'm doing what they expect from me given the our current relationship status (see first note in @[blahblog](2022-05-14 12:24)), which makes disloyalty definitely a *sin* -- but "sin" is just a greater relationship between you and your superior deity -- so again, it's an expectation, and I'm liable to do what I want to do, not what I'm expected to do.

so now imagine for a moment that I also represent the swiss industrial spies. I also fit that symbol as well, because I'm sorta "above the law" in that, if I were to develop a system (like the "party LAN" project), there isn't a whole lot they could do to stop me. for anyone else, they can do all sorts of stuff to dissuade them from developing something that threatens their monopoly, but for me, it's much more difficult. the major problem that most other people have with such a system is they simply don't believe in theirselves enough to do it, and if they do, they've already turned to the dark side.

the idea here is that eventually, my own (woke california blowhard) pontification will cause me to have to give up the little wooden boy..

I've been trying to figure out what the little wooden boy represents, and so following the idea that carmelita is symbolic of andrea, during that time, I adopted the perpetual evolution-of-desire approach to life. I don't want to actually get any manifestations, not for any other reason that I need or want them, but because I want to become the embodiment of that manifestation rather than having the manifestation itself.

so let's say that's the wooden boy, right? that means that I have to burn the evolution-of-desire aspect allowing whatever to manifest so that I can have nosebook back as my sidekick?

see how it just doesn't make sense? I've given up on the party LAN idea and I think it's totally cool if they use that technology to keep me "forever" held away from my connection, because I know that I'll eventually get to feeling so good (even without my connection), that I'll still feel really amazing and have a body to match.

### 2022-06-01 17:27 - venus and adonis

after writing @[sitchin/thoughts](2022-06-01 04:44), I've been thinking about the venus and adonis (dumuzi) play by shakespere. I haven't read it, but I did read its synopsis on wikipedia a while back. the jist of it is that adonis wants to work really badly and his work causes his own death because of his denial of venus.

I think I used that allegory a while back to say that I don't deny venus or try to fight against her advances because that will backfire on me. I'll experience the unwanted aspect of my own concept of trying to fight her.

---

this time I would like to look at the story from a whole different angle... so, the sirians say that venus comes from the same material as ra/marduk/zeus/jupiter which is a silica based crystalline structure that glows -- and sure enough, if you look out in the morning a month ago venus and jupiter will be in the morning sky right next to each other glowing. venus is a little brighter because it's closer, but they look pretty similar.

the sirians identify ra as a 3rd ray male emitter and venus as a 3rd ray female. the difference there is that ra takes in a concept (5) and outputs a structure, while venus takes in a structure and outputs another structure. this is pretty important because this will greatly influence their behaviour.

I also haven't got to the part of the story where dumuzi is killed, but I did notice the parallels to the story with senmut and hatshepsut. I do know that dumuzi receives a dream (a symbolic interaction, structure) of things that fortell his future -- a "fate" -- and then after his interaction with innana/venus he falls right into the trap and that structure becomes a reality.

I believe this is a very similar story to the "venus and adonis" story by shakespere.

---

the next thing that I want to talk about, is the form of perception of these reborn-deities. when looking over the pantheon outlined by the sirians, the females cover most of the primary layers of perception (1, 3, (not 5), and 7), with the only exception being isis (-2). the males fall into two basic categories: the ones that had a sacrficial/memorable death are: jeortau (+2), saturn (+-4), and osiris (+-6-+).

I'm considering saturn to be roughly similar to saturn, but also is extremely similar to osiris. the place where they're similar is that their deaths happen around a celebration. if you'll remember, so is jesus' death as well. right after the celebrated entrance (palm sunday), he gets "betrayed" and then sentenced to death. both asar/osiris and dumuzi met their demise after a celebration, as well.

---

osiris (6) is betrayed by ra (3).
dumuzi (4?) is betrayed by innana (3).
jeortau (2) is betrayed(?) by anu (1).

man, I'm really struggling here for some reason... I'll just explain what I see...

a celebration is a time when you feel better than you normally do. what happens vibrationally is an image (6) gets created which makes a structure (3) during the celebration -- and because you feel better than you normally do, it's easy to see that structure optimistically. however later, when back to normal, that structure gets turned into reality.

I really can't think here... I need to come back to this.

breadmaster
opposite 7th ray and 3rd ray interactions

### 2022-06-03 22:44 - the breadmaster and events

I still need to finish up the previous thing on venus and adonis' connection to the breadmaster, but I was listening to snake-bros #059 - strangeness in the woods (I think) and there was a story about these two guys out in the woods that heard this sound of water running and it sounded really nice and he'd never thought that running water sounded so nice but it sounded so nice him and his buddy (without saying anything to each other) both decided to get up and start looking for the source of the water. he said that the sound started to get more and more playful sounding, really wanting them to go into the woods to look for it, but it kept getting fainter...

he finally decided to get out of there because when he stopped and was trying to figure the thing out (with his logical mind) rather than just following his feelings/desire, suddenly he started to feel a sinister feeling rather than the pleasurable and playful water sound from before. when they finally decided to leave, playful water from before converted into a sinister feeling of being watched.

I look at this two ways: I consider this the difference between rational and emotional thinking (perhaps right/left brain). there is this constant battle between the rational way of looking at things (something is trying to lure me into the forest) and the just having fun and being playful, so there's nothing to worry about. I tend to err on the side of emotional thinking. if I'm feeling something playful and fun, then that's what I'm attracting, and it's fine. if someone tries to convert that playful and fun feeling into something of terror, they'll have a different experience than I do. I'll seemingly walk away from the situation having had a fun time even though some weird stuff happened.

what I'm saying is that, what I think happened in that event is that the guy and his buddy were having a really fun and playful time in the forest, and so that feeling started to manifest as a sound of running water that was really playful. however, then he started to try and begin to figure it out logically and that's when that feeling of awesome turned into something sinister. if he had of kept feeling more and more playful, he probably would have manifest something of that sort into reality. likewise, if, instead of noping out, he stayed to find out the sinister feeling that too would have manifested into more and more physical reality.

---

I brought that story up because it directly correlates with what I want to talk about. there's this idea that is very common that says that you can be lured into a bad situation with pleasure. I personally subscribe to this, and I've seen it happen over and over with drugs, sex, and party situations where -- when feeling better than normal, we're more inclined to believe someone or to be tricked by someone with ulterior motives.

as such, I have spoken many times about the difference between genuine good-feeling because of perception and a temporary good-feeling because of pleasure. when feeling better than normal/usual, it's been my experience that if I keep that up for any length of time, a crash and burn is eminent.

---

so first let's look at the venus and adonis idea. he must know or have associated the concept of extended pleasure as being a prerequisite to crash and burn. dumuzi and many others have crashed and burned after venus turned up the speed of reality creation. this is very commonly the case with coke and other artificial means of causing one to feel better than normal[^1]. so, combatting this, adonis, learning from dumuzi's mistake goes the opposite direction and decides to engage himself in his work instead of engaging in pleasure which leads to rapid reality creation.

this gives me the opportunity to talk about the differences between 3rd ray and 7th ray: venus was a 3rd ray, so that means she inputs perception and pathfinding logic toward desire and then outputs the same. if adonis' only desire is to hook up with a hot chick, then you can imagine his dismay when he finds out that it wasn't nearly all he had imagined it to be, and so now he's sorta left with nothing (OK, now what do I do? I just fulfilled my desire?) so, he engages himself in his work[^2] because work is stable (it doesn't leave you), and work doesn't talk back or critisise you (he's a self-employed hunter), and so work is a pretty stable source of good-feeling for him.

I can't remember the story, but venus, because she didn't get her way with him, tells him he's going to die (structure), and so somehow he ends up believing her pathfinding logic rather than following his own feelings and follows the same path as dumuzi. so, dumuzi crashed and burned because of venus and pleasure and adonis crashed and burned because he believed her structure more than his own.

that's a 3rd ray, though; a 7th ray is a bit different, and I haven't totally figured it out, but what I do know is that structure is arrived to by a 7th ray from the ground-up, as opposed to the 3th ray's top-down (prophetic) approach. the 3rd ray says the path and things have to extend outward in the intended form of creation. as an example enki and ninmah are constantly manipulating things from the top down to try and make things satisfying or pleasurable, but the 7th ray (like ningishzidda) takes current circumstances and then adjusts things so that they can conform to the requirements.

it's kind of the opposite approach too. I think of this as strarting with a lot of data, use the imagination to figure out the concept (frequency/feeling) behind that data, and then from there try to figure out how to harmonise that with the rest of the creation. the 3rd ray approach is to create the things, and then set them out into the wild and just sorta let them figure out how to come into harmony with each other (often times leading to disastrous or "baffling" results).

---

so now, when looking at the breadmaster, let's look at the symbols and their progression.

the bread that the breadmaster bakes tastes pretty good, but it causes tick to feel lethargy, sleepiness, and a desire to stay where he's at and give up.

I haven't figured out the bread college thing, but the breadmaster is pissed off that he got expelled from the baking college. he places a loaf in there and the tick eats it. it seems to be something to do with getting expelled. I'm not the breadmaster, so I don't understand that part.

the breadmaster decides he wants to bake a suffle that will entirely consume the city (presumably putting them in the same state as tick of lethargy, warmth and sleepiness). he orders some ingredients or else they're going to increase bread bombings. the mayor (US govt) of the city (nosebook) agrees to give him the ingredients he needs. it's pretty safe to say that the suffle has something to do with sex, with the goal being lethargy and sleepiness.

the breadmaster can bake the suffle without sugar, and so he does in the munincipal pool. the suffle is expanding rapidly consuming the whole city, so they get human bullet to shoot tick out of the gun to destroy the suffle.

the tick asks for a triple charge and the human bullet says that'll destroy a man. tick thinks he's not normal.

well, those words of a triple charge have stuck in my head. a while back I noticed that the solar flares that register as c-class flares feel to me like m or x-class flares. I postulated that this along with other data that the GOES x-ray flux meter is registering a whole order of magnitude lower than it should (so a c-flare is really an m-flare). well, around the time of my birthday, it was constantly in the c-range. shortly thereafter, the flux went down to b-range (it's possible a sunspot rotated off of the disk -- didn't check), but the solar activity that's associated with the episodes where I leave my body and start to see images totally did not decrease, but actually have increased the last few days. the readout *says* b-range, but my body *feels* like it's in m or x-range. I also had the sensation that's what it meant by "double, no triple charge" -- so that means were on double charge now and we have to get to triple.

the tick gets shot out of the cannon and explodes the suffle. so, the suffle which was previously consuming the city (nosebook), now has blanketed in suffle (it looks like snow) and tick says, "the city looks almost peaceful under a blanket of freshly fallen suffle" -- so sleep and lethargy are turned into "almost peaceful".

---

there is this part too when they figure out it's at the munincipal swimming pool. they go there and instead of just confronting him, the tick does an unusually large dive off of the diving board before capturing them. after being captured, they realise the suffle is self-baking and can't be stopped -- so that's why they go to the human bullet.

what this seems to imply is that before the shooting of the gun, there is a pretty epic nosedive. this gives the impression that they have to find some way to do that thing that venus does where dumuzi is lured into venus' trap using a celebration of some sorts. this better than normal feeling is then used to cause him to destroy himself -- or, in this case, do a pretty epic nosedive.

I don't really mind that they can try to attempt that all they want, but my goal is to just keep feeling "normal". and so, like adonis, I tend to keep my distance from anything that feels good.

these sorts of things are one thing where if I go after it, or try to go at it logically, like the guys in the forest, that playful feeling will turn sinister pretty quickly.

the solution to this is neither to push venus away or to go after her. both of those result in disaster. the only way to go about it is to just stick to myself and keep doing my own thing. she'll eventually find her way up to me. it's the law of attraction, not the law of running away. if I tried to attract venus using physical means or some other gimmick, it would definitely backfire because once the path to that desire is fulfilled (and it'll never be everything you wanted[^3]), so then what next?

---

so then the last thing is, I woke up this morning thinking about the concept of "going infinite" -- the idea where I continually self-sabotage infinitely and "never" get to the manifestation.

it was in the context of this whole thing with nosebook. nobody can stop me from self-sabotaging. if I have too good of conditions, I get connected and so therefore can manipulate the timeline so that I sabotage myself, and it's kinda a bad idea (though they could if they wanted) to kill me -- but then again, what if I just reinserted myself? my point is, there's nobody that can stop me from self-sabotage. I can do it infinitely, so what that means is that you could eventually imagine that the manifestation would get so big that we're talking about much much more than just sex or something -- as in, if there isn't anything this planet, galaxy, or solar system can offer, what would happen then?

I've postulated a lot about this idea because there are physical limitations, but then couldn't I sabotage myself by figuring out a technology which can surpass those physical limitations and then go back to sabotage again?

it seems there's no limit to how much I can keep doing this, so why not just keep doing it? I don't actually have to make any movement.

---

this reminded me of a thing a long time ago, when I was thinking about effortless power and the idea of fighting using the technique, because you don't really want to make any movement because the opponent can always turn it against you. the most effortless is to always let them exert the effort. so, you would end up fighting others that also know this, and fights with them end in a stalemate. there would be no way for me to ever "win" if I fought someone who neither wanted to make the first move.

fortunately, this isn't the case. nosebook is filled with the alpha types that want to make the first move, so I don't ever have to worry about them deciding to stop making the first move. I can just stay put forever. I don't need to go toward venus or away from her either, so I guess we'll have to see what ends up happening. she can try to define a structure, but that effort will just get amplified and reflected back[^4]. she's got to find her way into my structure instead trying to put me inside of hers.

there's probably a limit somewhere, but I don't know where that would be -- as in, is this the beginnings of the creation of a new universe? ...they did say "matured". I just don't know...

the conclusion that I came to this morning though is, if I'm hell-bent on trying to exploit myself in every possible way to ensure I "never" get the manifestation, then that means that you guys have to create what you want. don't wait for me to create what you want.

well, I can tell you what'll happen: I'll keep finding my connection and self-sabotaging until eventually there won't be a way to self-sabotage anymore. I wonder if that's what "perfected 7th ray" means.

---

you wanted to undo the breadmaster symbols. how's that?

[1]: which is why I think in the woods they were probably feeling pretty good and that's what caused the initial event

[2]: or finds a hobby, as the pua guides suggest

[3]: I can't really describe this concept very well, but my experience has shown me that whenever the goal is a woman, it leads to unhappiness. the most common sensation of it is that the physical manifestation was never as good as hoped for. it never meets expectations, and most guys come away usually kinda upset that she's so moody or whatever. I've also noticed that women are a pretty good reflection of their partner, so the objective to finding a good woman that won't turn into a disaster is to not be a disaster yourself. it never satisfies. you can only truly find satisfaction by yourself. trying to do it with another person always amplifies your own dissatisfaction (peaceful, *for now*).

[4]: I want to talk about this more, but my brain is mush right now.

### 2022-06-15 18:37 - the parent improvement push and pull

I noticed another resonance between conversations. at becky's house she said that her mom was some way, which she also said she was the same way (can't remember what it was now), so I asked if she was like her mom. she explained to me that she was as different from her mom as something is to another very distant thing.

I could feel what she was saying and it reminded me of my father and me. I thought myself to be very different from him, but in reality we're quite alike. at some point I stopped trying to be different than him and accepted that we were pretty similar, and then along with that I decided I wanted to improve on all of the aspects that we share, adapt them and do them better.

later on in the car, I was talking with mom about dani and how I realised that he wanted for me to be constante/consistent, but that wasn't actually what he really wanted, because it was sorta the thing of drinking around sober people -- even while drunk, I can see my own ridiculousness through their eyes, so because I don't want to see myself as ridiculous, I want them to get drunk with me so we're on the same level. in reality, neither dani or I wanted to actually be sober or lucid.

I then talked with mom about how we think we want something, but then we don't actually want it because we don't contemplate the reality change to make that happen.

I didn't really correlate the conversations, but it's the same thing. parents want their kids to be better than them and to do better (just like dani wanted me to be constant), but they don't *actually* want it, in a lot of cases, because it means their kid will actually be better at it.

so then I warped back to the conversation with becky and I was thinking about how that parents interact with their kids and want the kids to be *different* because they don't want them to be *better*. so I constructed an example: imagine that sarah wanted her daughters to make it through adolescence without all of the problems and stuff, so she wants them to take a different path than she did -- and so she wants her kids to be *different* than she is, but not necessarily better.

what if her kids were to find a way to get through all of their adolescence without all of the regret[^1] and to improve on their trajectory *without* doing it differently. what if they just figured out how to the same thing, better?

my point is, we want things for other people, but we don't actually think about what the future would be like if that were actually true.

this whole thing is also a resonance to the father's day card as well. it's kinda funny how that kicked this whole thing off.

[1]: I can't say for sure this is what she felt, but as I was carrying becky's[^2] dresses, I was feeling sarah and it felt like lots of mistakes, bad decisions, underappreciation for her beauty, and stuff like that. hard to put it all into words.

[2]: I don't know how this happened because I was carrying becky's dresses, but one of them she mentioned sarah and the dress she bought for prom or something and I caught the feeling as she said that. I don't know where the feelings come from. anyway, somewhere in there, I felt the same feeling of her mom wanting becky to be different from her, and she was, but there seemed like there was also a "this is what I had to go through so this is why I'm the way I am, and when you go through it, you'll see and be just like I am, even though I want you to be different" -- sorta feeling.
