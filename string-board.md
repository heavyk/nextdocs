# special k(id)'s string board

### 2022-05-10 21:45 - intro

a few days ago I was asking the question, "why" (see @[blahblog](2022-05-09 14:55)) and I ended the entry with a song called "supermode - tell me why". in addition to that I was listening to snake-bros #027 "pillars of enoch" where they (now russ, you are "they") were talking about the "why" -- well, earlier on in the episode they were discussing sean carroll. I went on to his website and he suggested a book called, "the book of why" dana mackenzie and judea pearl. I read part of the introduction and the book goes wayyyy over my head.

I believe the problem is that they put these formulas down with these symbols which mean things to them, and in their brains, it appears that these symbols are viewed and their entire meaning is understood and then they can then just use the shorthand letter and that letter is just a placeholder for everything that symbol "means". I do not "see" anything in my head, and so therefore I don't actually "see what they mean to say" -- so I have to approach the concept from a different perspective.

the only time I've ever seen something similar to the way their brains operate was with my interactions with the "reality technicians" when eating mushrooms. they would show me a glowing orb (a kind of symbol), and then forevermore I knew that symbol, and from then on that symbol took on many different forms and I saw it in many examples in my life, and so then by life experience these symbols came to life for me and I "knew" them through experience. once I had the knowledge of these symbols I could cause them to interact with other concepts and produce new concepts.

I learned a lot about this type of symbolic interaction with a concept producing a lot of other concepts in my life that would then begin to illumiate this symbol further when I went to spain. especially the women, but the men as well take in data sorta like statistics does (the data becomes enumeration of actions of the symbol which is usually a person or a government entity) and then thes data points when interacting with concepts, "mean something". these symbols become the main characters in stories and are then exaggerated to a point to where they become a "personaje" and that pattern which the personaje performs follows them around and you could say with a very high statistical certainty that personaje is related to those types of actions.

anyway, that isn't what I wanted to say. what I wanted to say is that I want to go back and read the book a little better, cause it calls me. so I'll do something I've always wanted to try, which is take something I don't understand and then turn the feeling/concept it gives me into something tangible (ie. repeat what I understood they wrote, but in my own words).

---

long intro. this blog is inspired by that because we all have these random symbols pass through our lives and they "mean" something to us, but there is no way that these meanings could have any statistical relevance to anything.

we all get fixated on these weird "syncs" that happen (like the why question) all at once, and in my experience, they forever alter my trajectory through life. there's no way they could ever possibly mean anything at the time, but on hindsight, they seem to stand out. I'm going to begin to chronicle them here.

I'm willing to let it all hang out and show people that they're not weird for thinking that "random" occurances which "mean something" get mistaken for "why" :)

by the end of this, you'll see that I'm a very "special" kid that has a problem of seeing everything as symbolically interconnected. it's a real problem that I have, cause I bring a lot of disaster on myself by looking to symbols for the "guidance" rather than trusting my emotions.

also, by the end of this, I hope to illustrate how very different of a perspective it is to have difficulty seeing where "I" begin and end in my experience; is everything just a reflection of my own mentation? why?

### 2022-05-10 22:11 - that mustache feeling

in @[blahblog](2022-05-10 16:52), I made the case that I wanted to let a girl find her connection and then attract me, that way *I would be a reflection of her desire*. when I wrote that, suddenly eva (my neighbour popped into my mind). I noted this down and when I was doing so, I thought also about zaryn's ex in spain as well (don't know her last names). I didn't think much about it, because the idea I had in my head was that it would probably be one of the girls that's using one of my bodies that will find their connection, not so much one of the younger ones, cause how can you find your connection (without conducive conditions), with a barely developed brain. it takes a bit to learn how to use one's perception to feel the way one wants to feel, and so what I was meaning is that one of those girls using my bodies has a *much* better chance at finding their connection with all those good physical conditions around. they have the exact opposite problem that I have and only need a slight capacity to perceive things the way they want to, to get it. it's really easy.

anyway, after that, I turned on "the tick" and it was "s03e01 - that mustache feeling", and in it tick wakes up one morning with a mustache. remember, tick is already a woman in a boy's body, but me has a lot of feminine qualities, like no package, and never any facial hair. this time he has a mustache and so he breaks into a whole song complete with 90's rap about how great his mustache is, and tells the guys at the diner that now he finally he can describe himself as "rugged, self-assured, adult". "it says to the world, I'm a man of action; but action tempered with maturity" arthur is super frustrated and annoyed at tick for his mustache.

---

OK, for me tick is a symbol of me, and arthur is nosebook in general. he represents the constantly worrying brains which have to keep coming up with new ideas to get me and them out of trouble that I get them into. I don't really know who the others really represent[^1], but when it came to the scene with "special angent jim rage", I immediately associated him with mr. motor.

special agent rage is a part of a non-existant portion of the government that lost funding, and he's on a personal mission to get rid of this mustache. he's got 3 vivacius, exciting, talented beauticians, which reminded me a lot of the song, "armand van helden - my my my" which also has three girls in it of the similar colour (black, brown, and white).

anyway, the mustache has fallen in love with a russian beard.

---

at the end of @[blahblog](2022-05-09 14:55), I put in the supermode song and then watched the video a little bit later. I remember seeing the video a long time ago and it's the same as all the other trance videos coming out of germany at the time -- so I didn't notice anything special about it. this time I noticed that there were two dudes. one was red and one is white. the red one drives a white car and the white one drives a red car. I can't quite figure out what happens in the middle of the video, but one of them has trouble with their car and a blond girl in blue jumps into the race and beats the red and white ones.

I noticed the symbolism and pointed out that they're telling a story here and related it to egypt. upper egypt is white (bowling pin hat) and lower egypt is red (champagne bucket), and they were united for a while, red driving white and white driving red. however when akhenaten came into power, the hats changed and suddenly a blue hat that looks like a longhead starts to appear. I believe the egyptian hats are symbols of bloodlines, and there are a lot of flags with red white and blue in them, but the USA is the most symbolic with the red and white on the periphery with blue in the core (you know where the stars are[^2]). in egypt, this blue colour symbolised a female bloodline that descended from the daughters of akhenaten.

anyway, the racing part reminded me of the song "cake - going the distance" -- a song about a guy who is going the distance, going for speed (this is symbolic of me) and all the while he's doing this "she's in her time of need" (so he this distance dude is leaving the girls when they "need" (evolution-of-desire) him the most). OK, so when noticing the two boys lose to the girl in blue, it was obvious to me that this was a sign that it would be a girl that wins the race, not either of the boys.

I noted the flags have those same colours and mistakenly thought that the russian flag had red and white on the bottom and blue on the top. I looked it up and actually that's the flag of a small district in germany I'd never heard of. the only flags that had blue in an elevated or core position is norway (blue cross surrouneded by white and then red on the periphery).

the russian mistake caught my eye because the mustache (which represents to me the girls that are using my bodies) is actually in love with a russian beard. I don't know what that could possibly mean, as it could potentially imply a lot of things.

weird connection there.

anyway, so back to the episode: at the end the mustache drags sewer urchin by the upper lip out to meet with the russian beard and rage is stopped from destroying the mustache by the tick. it's revealed that the department lost its funding so the three girls bail on him. the tick then does a monologue about how love is cool and jim rage had all of the really cool stuff and the three girls, but he wasn't cool. the tick lost the thing that made him cool (the mustache), and he didn't gain a thing.

so the next episode is "the little wooden boy and the belly of *love*" -- where tick has to burn his wooden friend to get them out of the whale.

I had something else I wanted to write but that's enough "why" for now.

---

final thing I noticed: in the "my my my" song, it's full of questions, but they never ask why. they ask "what" as in "where's it going to go" (what's going to happen), and "how" did it get to the state that was never meant ("neuroticfish - mechanic of the sequence" reference)

[1]: I don't associate sewer urchin and deflater-mouse to anyone in particular, but they would probably be my friends, so I see a little bit of chris in sewer urchin, and daniel in deflater-mouse -- though they really could be anyone

[2]: the stars are symbolic to me because I think of girls as stars and boys more as planets, and in my idea where we go along optimising ourselves to maximise energy, I think of the idea of when the sun goes supernova/quasar, the girls concept will get attracted so rapidly to the sun, they would tear through it attracting all of the stuff that resonates with their concept, and they'd emerge on the other side as a tiny star. continuing to attract hydrogen and spew out more dense materials, they'll gain size and higher density planets into orbit with them. the blue ones are the future stars.

### 2022-05-11 02:13 - symbols are why

I've had a lot of interesting reactions to @[string-board](2022-05-10 21:45), and one of those is that I'm somehow critisising the book of why just because I don't understand it and it's far over my head. actually, that's not the case at all.

I realised that my form of thinking is exactly backwards to theirs as I was trying to figure out how to assimilate their concepts. they begin the intro by explaining the mantra that "correlation is not causation" with the example that the rooster will make a sound around the time of the sunrise, but the rooster does not cause the sunrise. well, that's probably true, but that's no more true than the sunrise causing the rooster to make a sound -- and so they stress that there is association between those events, but neither event causes the other event to happen, rather that statistically, there is a statistically higher likelyhood of events happening together.

I get all of that cause that's intro to statistics stuff, but I had a very difficult making the connection from statistical associations and correlations to "why". they gave a flowchart of a machine learning loop as an example of how to begin to make the connection between association and why, with some extra data analysis steps in there to filter out unlikely correlation. at that point, I sorta glazed over and I couldn't track with them conceptually so I resolved to take another look at it later.

in the meantime, I tried to get into their heads a bit and figure out how they think, to figure out why I found the last part so difficult to *feel* -- as in I lost the capacity to feel the concept they were emanating, which means there is an incompatibilty in our thinking process. I get into people's heads to figure out *how* they think, not *why* or *what* they think. for me the what is inconsequential as that's always going to reflect the condition of their environment. the why usually has to do with past experience, but it's the *how* which reveals the underlying form of perception that arrives them to their conclusions.

so, when I got into their heads, I noticed that this logic process was very visual for them and they could move around and perform operations using these symbols, and it's not the results that mean something, but the symbols themselves have meaning. they have "P" on the paper and I see a letter. as a comuputer programmer I know it's a function with paramaters, and that function returns a value, but it felt like for them, that P was not a function but a *meaning*. another variable may be "persons who ..." and that could be represented by a letter "d" (for example), and again, I see the letter d, and I know it's a variable containing a value, but again as a computer programmer, this is just a value somewhere on the stack in the microprocessor -- a simple scalar -- but again, it felt to me that their version of that letter had a lot more meaning to it -- as in it's the "right" data, and not just a number.

for me, functions accept inputs of certain types and return a value of another certain type. I don't place any importance on the meaning of the data going into the function, because the data going into the function for me is not a number but a feeling (a concept). the function for me is the symbol. it's the archetype that is performing the operation on the concept/feeling -- and so therefore it's possible to detect seemingly connected concepts (cause they feel similar as an output of the operation) that don't appear to have any statistical connection between them.

I'm not saying they're wrong or right, but that I'm completely backwards from their style of thinking. I see connections between a cartoon, two songs, and a 2-3kya empire. I'm more like marshall mcluhan than a statistician in my form of thought, because I recognise that it's the "how" (the medium) that is the message, not the the "what" (data, statistics) or the "why" (what this book tries to explain).

obviously don't know much about the why yet, which is why I'm so recently enfatuated with it. I'm excited to learn more about the science of why as I continue on with this book.

---

hrm, that wasn't the conclusion I wanted to end on. so here comes the second segment:

for me the whole of everything feels to me in one way or another. I know that "feels to me" is bad english, but it's a phrase that exists in spanish but not in english. when I want to say I like something in english, I say, "I like this". in spanish, it's, "this thing likes to me" -- and the best way to describe that in english is "this thing resonates with me". learning the reflective verb of gustar helped me to understand this concept in a way that finally made sense to me.

the subconscious realisation that verb has is that every time I say I like something, it brings it *to* me. I suppose there is a verb "odiar" but in general things that I don't like just become, "no me gusta a mi" (it doesn't like to me) or "a mi, no me gusta" (in my opinion, it doesn't like to me) -- which illustrates a very big flaw in spanish interaction -- which is that the phrase feels like the thing (which I don't resonate with) isn't going to me, or even that it's going away from me -- when that's not the case at all.

time and again, I saw people complaining about the same crap over and over again because they kept "(not) liking it to them" by "not liking it (to them)" -- and so what I'm getting at here is that the for them, they would perceive things much more similar to how I see things in that you have an archetype/personaje (like a "pijo" or a "kani" or a "chulo") and their actions get simplifed down into data points which mean something like "vendiendo hielo a los penguinos", "bebiedo a tope", "chuleria", etc. and that fits their profile. "why" do they do they behave like that? because that's what's expected of them. they fit their profile.

once I got identified as a profile, then they accept me. this was largely one of the biggest reasons for my such heavy drinking -- because I was a daily heavy drinker just like most of the rest of them. I showed up to work buzzed, rebuzzed during lunch, and after work was drinks again. in their system, they could fit me into one of their boxes, and so then they could accept me. often times I fit into so many of their boxes, they considered me essentially "spanish". it's a very accepting culture, once they have a way to relate to you. also, as long as you retained some relatable aspect, they would then let you be free to do whatever -- but I always had to have a flaw which allowed them to see me fitting into a category.

I said all of that because I used their symbolic representation of a person to kind of slip through the cracks of reality in their system. because I figured out their system, I could be whatever to anyone or nobody to someone else. they used image (clothes, suit, etc) and words (dialect, and forms of expression) to construct and maintain an image to the public. in private it could change, but it was just another image. I wore the same clothes pretty frequently and didn't really try to make an image for myself that way. I tried using my words to create an image but I was always "puto yanki/junki" in my words so instead I constructed my image entirely virtually by changing how I related to people. the aspects I showed them would classify me as one archetype, and I didn't have to change my appearance or even my behaviour. I just changed what symbol they saw when they looked at me or thought about me. it's very hard to describe this capacity -- but I sorta just look at me from their point of view (I probably acquired this capacity from patricia[^1]) and then see myself as a symbol of whatever.

I quickly realised that I didn't really care what symbol people perceived me as and sorta gave up on the impression and the entire charade and went back to the states. in reality, all of the things that I could see myself as (through the eyes of other people) were useless because nobody saw me for me -- for who I really was -- not even me. this was around the time of the arrival of nosebook and I realised that even with so many people with so much access to me, they *still* didn't see me for me -- and neither did I, *still*..

I used to derive a lot of meaning out of the "syncs" that would constantly happen around me, thinking they were sort of like signs or directions to send me in ways that I should go. what I didn't realise is that I was the one seeing those symbols and I was the one that was attracting them -- both the things that liked to me and the things that didn't like to me, equally. and I would recognise them both and say, "oh I've seen this before so I know what's coming next". I did this just recently (@[blahblog](2022-05-09 09:38)) when I said that the project didn't feel like the previous times when something was about to dramatically alter my physical conditons, but it felt natural and logical and obvious that it'll be what happens next.

how do I know what'll happen next? well, that's the thing. it feels the same as the spanish person expecting chuleria from some douchebag. it feels obvious that it's what's coming next. I can't really convey into words how it is but the successful operations that these symbols have on concepts (concepts are just the particles, not the wave) form a sort of web of pathways where some are more likely than others.

why are they more likely? because the "known" operations the symbols perform on the concepts are "why".

---

I'm hoping to illuminate these ideas a little more as I continue on with this book, but I felt like I should write out the way I see it first and clear up a few things.

I even see things like the date for this entry as meaningful: 02:13 or (0,+2)(+l,3). it's four unique sequential numbers, and the intervals as well. I love the symmetry between them too being two groups of two numbers two distant from each other.

what I've noticed is that people who see connections all over the place are considered to be less intelligent or something like that, but I've noticed that a lot of really brilliant people see connections all over the place and that creates an open-mindedness which allows for more "syncs" to happen.

so what I'm trying to say is that for those people who see those connections, the things that those connections mean to them become automatically much more likely.

the last conclusion here (I know that this is the third one), is that this sort of symbolic system creates a lot of rigidity because it's very difficult to exit from the boxes that others put you in ... however, I aim to begin to show that once you know how to game the system, the system of symbolic expectation makes new and unexpected (statistically very unlikely) things to become very easy to pull off.

I'm reminded of the card where I illustrated my hemispheres personified as symbols on to paper and many people were sure that it meant whatever. well, surity that it means someting (even from someone else) adds energy into the equation and in the end, what finally manifests is what it means to you. skerptards are your worst "enemy" but also your "biggest supporter" as well. so put your friends into ridiculous boxes and then allow that symbol to manifest into something different than expected.

[1]: as I was editing that just now, I was reminded of michiel's wife which I think may have also been named patricia, too. very strange. I never noticed that connection before. I wonder if he too picked up a similar capacity from her. that would be ultra "coincidence".

### 2022-05-11 13:41 - antimemes and hiding things in plain sight

I'm listening to snake-bros #029 now and russ is talking about antimemes -- the opposite of a meme, is an idea that does not want to be retained in memory or propagated.

it's kinda cool because last night I ended talking about how skerptards are your greatest enemy if you believe them, "pffffft, no dude that's just random correlation / coincidence", but they're also your greatest supporter if you believe you (doesn't matter what they believe).

kyle brought up a really great example of the cathedral, and in it he showed how they seemingly give "information overload" and so you go away with a sense of awe, but no specific memory of any of the exact symbols. then russ added to that with another great example of the commisioners of the cathedral getting the most awesome structure, but the builders of the cathedral told their (sacred geometry as divinity) story with the symbols of the religion, and because they're somewhat compatible, the church people are so blinded by church symbols memes that they miss the underlying antimeme that holds their whole meme together.

---

so I thought about it and the concept of an antimeme is easily explainable if we think of an antimeme as any concept which is incompatible with the person's perception. all radio signals are antimemes to us, because they're there and we could be looking right at them (like his 411 monster) but we simply don't see them because they're not compatible with our perception. if you trained your eyes to see certin frequencies of the EM spectrum, you could start to see some of those previously invisible things (antimemes).

---

this is a beautiful example of what I was talking about with the symbols -- because they're there and so many people see the surface appearance (the hero on a horse, the dragon, the prince and princess,kingdom, etc.) but in reality, those symbols *mean* something to you, and so they have to be believable enough for someone to look at it and say, "yep, that's real" for them to believe it to become real.

imagine for a moment the movie, "encanto" -- and the story has all of these characters with their flaws and interactions that seem real enough that you totally miss that the house has a personality, is driving the story, and that it's totally impossible -- and so I leave that film thinking, "yep, seems plausible". other people focus on the house saying, "houses can't move things around like that -- the house would have to have positional antigravity pulses and an AI capable of responding to suscinct interactions grasping the meaning of what's inferred by the person's desire for 'help'" -- and those people would totally miss the symbols in the characters personalities, believing them to be "real enough" or "not nearly as problmatic as the idea of a magical house" -- so they consider the characters to be real.

no matter how one perceives the film, one part is the antimeme and the other is the meme. most people probably went away remembering all of of the characters, songs, and animation. for me, the film was like the cathedral in the information overload sense.

I've trained myself to not get so fixated on the overwhelming amount of detail by fixating on single details so I can subconsciously. I picked this trick up from "monk" the tv series where he would go around counting things and touching the tops of poles to keep is mind fixated on a simple detail so that he doesn't get information overload[^1] -- meanwhile subconsciously he's absorbing every detail and can revit it later with his photographic memory.

I don't have photographic memory, so I capture the essence of everything that I come into contact with. for example, to reply to a reaction of how I absorbed so much of that intro when I only barely read it, is because I applied this same principle. I fixated my mind on how over my head all of these crazy formulas are so I could subconsciously pick up the essence of the book without having to expend too much effort to try and figure out all of the weird forms of expression they were using.

I have so much more to say about this, but I don't yet know how to present it, so I'll just wait for the next event which gives me an excuse to write about it...

[1]: I believe this is also what tesla was doing when he was out in public in order to distract himself from the torrent of other wierd feelings that everyone else was putting out. he was highly sensetive so he spent most of his time inside of his inner world, but when he had to be externally focused around a lot of other people, he had to have a mania to distract him.

### 2022-05-12 20:20 - blowhard the long-distance leviathan

I want to write something, but I don't know what I want to write.

I just watched s03e01 - the little wooden boy and the belly of love. I might move this over to string-board, but for now I'm just blabbing cause I want to write. I noticed that ever since @[string-board](2022-05-10 22:11), where I mentioned that I find arthur to be symbolic of nosebook in general, now I see him completely differently.

this time when I watched it, I noticed new things. for example, let's say that arthur is nosebook, and carmelita's father is tesla -- the one who made their flying suits and many other devices -- well, he says he had invented a lot of things and decided he wanted to walk across the country when he got swallowed up by a whale. he didn't seem desperate to get out, and the tick reveals at the end that they were in "the belly of love".

in @[string-board](2022-05-10 22:11), I noted that there said that love is cool, tick's mustache made him cool, but the mustache just used him to get the beard the mustache was in love with.

in this episode arthur falls in love with carmelita and wants to spend time with her instead of being a sidekick to tick. OH, maybe arthur isn't so much nosebook in general but actually more like the "landscape architect" or something like that, because tick gets them into situations all the time because he thinks like he's invincible, so then arthur has to find a way to bail them out of the situation -- though it seems that tick always finds his way out of everything anyway, so arthur is mostly saving himself.

anyway, carmelita is a really weird character because arthur really likes her, saying things like, "we've barely just met but it feels like I've known you my whole life". the episode also has this feeling like she's trying to seduce him for some reason, but really all she wants to do is to figure out the codes her father (tesla) wrote in the notebook, which the decoder is inside of arthur's flying suit.

the tick get pissed that arthur is leaving him alone because he's in love with carmelita. tick is funny because he wants to do crappy "hobbies" with arthur, but they're like the worst hobbies (crafts) ever, like a macaroni duck, so now that arthur is gone, he decides to make his own sidekick out of his own craft which is the little wooden boy and then proceeds to go on patrol (ie. looking for crime/trouble). somehow the wooden boy hears the plight of arthur and carmelita's encounter with the above-the-law espionage crew, so the tick sounds the battlecry and goes to help them.

the three swiss industrial espionage guys (and one girl) try to take the notebook from arthur, and in the process arthur has to nearly undress fully. he says, "this is the most humiliating thing I've ever ..."

so let's say that there is a sort of city state (like the swiss) that is sort of "above the law" like the USA is, and they've nearly figured out how to recreate tesla's world system -- well, then this sort of industrial espionage would most certainly be the most humiliating thing, because then at that point they could tune into the physical experience of any person or animal on planet earth. nosebook wouldn't have any secrets at all.

they get the book and the decoder in arthur's flying suit and he goes to stop them. he flys out to get the swiss guy with no pants on and manages to stop him and get the book and his pants back by pinching the swiss guy's nose with tweezers (huh?) even though carmelita doesn't think he will succeed with tweezers. after he succeeds, she flys up to hug him in mid-air for (I suppose) getting the book back.

so she's hugging him in mid-air, the swiss falls to the ground and tick congratulates the little wooden boy for his hard work (the little wooden boy fights hilda, the only female swiss). arthur and carmelita are sharing a moment together in mid-air when "blow hole the legendary long-distance leviathan" (you know, the "he's going the distance, he's going for speed, she's all alone in her time of need" leviathan).

blow hole (which I always think of as "blow hard") makes a trip across the country every 10y (apparently). this is his second time going across the country[^1]. the first tour (2018) I crushed the hippies' dreams (sorry no drugs and sex), and then the next time I go for it (2028), is this the the time of this industrial espionage setup? blowhard captures the reporter, "sally vacuum" in the middle of her news coverage of him and takes her along; she wants to know where he sees himself in 10y (cause presumably he'll make another trip across the country again, then).

I suppose that blowhard is actually significant of my pontification. it's possible that nosebook makes some of my pontification/ideas difficult to find, and so from time to time, something happens and somebody discovers one of the hard to find bits, which then "goes viral" and spread by word of mouth "across the country".

so the whale is my message and at the core of it is carmelita's father (tesla). tick sees that carmelita and arthur are going to be swallowed up by blowhard and runs to catch them, getting swallowed as well. carmelita's father tells the tick that he has to burn his new sidekick to get out of blowhard the long-distance leviathan.

P.S. I was even pontificating about whales this morning, too.

[1]: so, if we consider that fwh said I have till 2038 and I came to the country in 2017, but I didn't really get settled in till 2018, that's exactly 20y, so that means that they seem to happen in intervals of every 10y, so 2018, 2028, then 2038 I'm gone.

### 2022-05-12 22:48 - USB

I don't really know what to do about this, but I remember I was out picking weeds on remi's driveway and found a quarter. paul offered me $25 and I found 25 cents -- so that's $5^2 and 5^2 cents. I thought that was cool. my memory is all jumbled around there, but it reminded me of janine bolon's book which I can't remember now but it made me think of a really funny "get rich quick" scheme: "making sense out of your dollars" ... with a slogan something like, "if by the end of this seminar, you aren't making cents out of your dollars, full money-back guarantee"

I was having a good laugh at that when I can't remember if it came before that event or after but I transported back to a dream a long time ago that I titled "adam and eve's dream". I just searched the archive and I can't find the dream for some reason. it may be one of the things my computer crashes were designed to erase. so cause I can't find it, I'll relay the dream again because it's gone now and it left a pretty good imprint on me.

in the dream, I remember there was something that was going to happen; I interpretted it as a cataclysm and everyone was preparing to get off of the earth or something.

the scene suddenly changed and now I'm in a foreign place and it looks sorta similar to earth, and there are these metallic buildings with supplies in them -- which I presumed to be preparations for the coming cataclysm.

the very first thing I noticed is how dark everything was. as in, there was barely any sunlight at all and there was way less ... I don't know what to call it, but it's that invisible colour that I "see" which I describe as being a part of people's aura or an element of the ether[^1]. in the dream I noticed there was basically nobody around, so I figured that was why there was all that missing inivisible colour that I usually see.

so, it's much darker than usual and there are these metal buildings with food supplies in them. there's basically no humans around anywhere but I don't feel danger. I just think they all left the earth to escape the cataclysm (something about going into a portal). I don't feel cold or warmth either -- just sorta normal -- but there's a tremendous amount of emptiness and space around me. it felt kinda like I was one of the only people there on earth because everyone had left. I don't remember plants, but it seemed like there was some form of vegitation. other than that, I notice there are a whole bunch girls that are there with me -- like a lot of them.

I really had this sense that it was just me and the girls and everyone else had peaced out. when I woke up I didn't feel anything particularly strong -- neither excitement or trepidation. it was just sorta what was happening. it felt clear to me that we were sort of starting from the beginning. it's for that reason that I labeled it "adam and eve's dream"

---

so I'm out on the driveway and I have this strong sense/reaction to something from nosebook where they are realising that I'm a rapidly accelerating problem that they need to get rid of. I just wrote @[blahblog](2022-05-12 13:38) and explained to jaron the idea of a dynamic meme designed to infect the human concept (half of the idea I told to jaron and the other half is written in blahblog), so the reaction was in relation to that, and they realised that it was getting harder and harder to contain me concepts and keep them from "going viral" (blowhard making a trip across the country?) and they were realising that there's no real good place to send me. I'm becoming a problem to their entire charade.

as I had that reaction, I had the realisation that if I just keep holding out, eventually I become such a problem that they have to send me to another planet. I then flashed into "adam and eve's dream" and realised that the reason why it was so dark is because I was on pluto.

I forget how much longer after that, I had another reaction and in this one, now I am in the spot of enki and I had designed the "adamu" to do all of this work in the field toiling and doing the weed picking, but the corrupted brotherhood had forced enki to never be able to find his connection again -- and here I (remember I'm enki in this vision/reaction experience) and I'm picking weeds and doing the labour now that he had designed the adamu to do because the annunaki were complaining about having to do the labour and stuff -- cept I'm not complaining about it. I said all of that to explain that the reaction was to emphasise a connection between enki and adamu switching places. I repeated the snake-bros sign-off phrase, "good night adamu; get back to work"

so putting all of the pieces together, does that mean if I continue to hold off on everything they throw at me, are they gonna have to ship us off-planet??? wow... that's a pretty good sized cucumber already, if that's the case. lol

(USB is a reference to jaron's comment today when I told him he can put bill and ted's excellent adventure on a usb memory. he said there's US plan A: USA -- and there's US plan B: USB)

[1]: for example, in places like discotecas or concerts, I see TONS of this invisible colour because there's such a density of people with strong emotions. it's related to emotions and it's stronger the more people feel around me.

### 2022-05-15 22:29 - quixote (first impression)

I was watching s02e02 - alone together, and I noticed some symbols in it. they're going to fix up the chairface chipendale's moon graphiti and there was a bit about the "quixote" probe. I've always wondered what the don quixote story was, so I went off looking to see what it could be. I started to read the synopsis on wikipedia and I started to get a sensation that a lot of the symbols seem very familar to me -- as in they sort of resonate with my life.

it's not uncommon for a person to see theirself in the symbols of a story, and actually it's probably the normal thing to do (though I don't know for certain). putting symbols into a story which are approachable by people is a very common thing.

---

one of the things that I've heard very often from people is that I don't see what I'm supposed to see. they see something mundane and ordinary yet I see something entirely different. it's as if I see things that are not there all the time. I think now my vision is a lot more controlled, but that happened with people's physical appearance and also with the picture that their words would paint. I just see a different thing and it's often times the exact opposite of what everyone else sees.

I used to blunder through life blaming and accusing people of things ...

---

jaron just told me good night and we got into a conversation abou highly-motivated people, so it's funny how the conversation I just had with him was about the subject that I was just going to write about...

I used to be a highly-motivated person, and I had these ideas that I wanted to *do*, and so I would go around and blame people for preventing me from doing them.

(I just wrote out the highly-motivated concept, and you can see how don quixote is a sort of comical, exaggerated version of that).

---

lots of chaos with the symbols, so I want to end this, but before I do, when I was reading about it, I noticed that part two of the book (which was written 10y later, like the return of blowhole), apparently (from what wikipedia said), the second part has a lot of new elements that become themes of the "modern novel" with character exploration, rather than just a bunch perfect chivalry knights doing awesome stuff. so more introspection and analysis on the personality than just an enumeration of nobility and the noble actions that they perform.

as I was reading that, it occurred to me that part two feels a lot like a timeline edit on cervantes part, which together with shakespere, seemed to derail the 1600's enlightenment period and turn us once again (in the sciences) to a more materialistic analysis, but on the character level, we're more "human" rather than just a bunch of arrogant (but enlightened) douchebags running the show.

ever since [writing my thoughts on "forms of life"](/forms-of-life/thoughts.md) where I noted how about 400ya, on the subject of species, we deleted the concept world and turned it into physical-reality-is-everything world.

it seems that this is also tied to the "s02e06 - bloomsday", "400 year bloom" where the plant is about to bloom, but it has to be held away from blooming "in the bad way" by playing it music. they have a few close calls, where it almost blooms, but "american maid" sings "my country tis of thee" and another american classic which I can't remember now. it starts getting really big and starts to bloom again but the tick sings "la donna e movile" to it to prevent the bloom.

I believe these songs are symbols of different aspects of things that we have been put into place to refocus us so that the flower (which represents humankind), doesn't "bloom in the bad way". or, seen from the leapfrogging-time-pickles perspective, these are self-sabotage events that happened.

imagine for a moment that the renaissance produced a golden age (a split that this timeline didn't have) and they figured out that there was a split, so having sufficient techology or perception they figured out how to tune into the other split (our timeline) and so all of the great enlightened ones (shakespere, cervantes, lope de vega, and many more) purposefully sabotaged their own art so that it changed the focus on to the character of the person, "beingness" versus status (as in, ser/estar, ser vivo/estado), and so on this timeline the great artists played a different music to prevent the 400y bloom from happening "in the bad way".

### 2022-05-18 22:58 - arthur and little wooden boy

I watched "s01e01 - the idea men" tonight and I noticed one thing which I don't know what it means, but in the intro, the tick says that he and arthur are not two men, "we are ten men". interesting.

anyway, I've noticed that arthur is always right-handed, though tick is usually left-handed. so, I was thinking about maybe the idea that arthur symbolises my left hemisphere and the tick the right, cause I had some reactions to the "little wooden boy" in that regard. I don't believe arthur symbolises my right side because his most notable characteristic is worry which is not something I do a lot of. he also has a flying moth suit, made by an inventor. I don't fly, and if I did, I would fly, not because I had a suit, but because I felt like I could fly.

I believe that some people at nosebook have ramped up their energy levels to a point where they can fly, so it's a device (something external to them) which gives them the capability. in one episode tick tries to convince arthur to carry him (manouvere 14C I think), but arthur doesn't think it'll work. I just don't really fit arthur's archetype.

arthur also in the grail quest, is the king which is searching for the grail (ie karmalita), and if he finds the grail (the female bloodline that increases the vitality of and heals the land), again, that's not me at all. the idea there is that if the king is good and just, then things will prosper and it'll go toward a golden age -- but, as I explained in quixote, that grail quest of knights and chivalry is a bunch of bunk, and quixote's optimism to a golden age only illustrated his delusion -- meaning, we're in the sabotage, so no golden age. the timeline where they went off and had their golden age exists and I believe it is them (we/me) that have influenced this timeline (self-sabotage) so that nobody gets connected (ie finds the grail), because that does create a golden age, but it also creates a cataclysm at the peak of the golden age.

I'm not searching for material things to give me flight or want to create a golden age. I believe that all of those external things that the golden age symbolises can and should be realised from within, so that you attract what's wanted rather than attracting a cataclysm at the hight of awesomeness (like the belt in s03e04). your awesomeness doesn't come from a material thing (like a belt) but from belief in oneself. I align much more with tick in that regard. in that first episode, tick tells arthur is time for him to start believing in himself.

I rest my case on that regard.

there is one objection to that, which is that tick is muscular externally as a sort of reflection of how he thinks, yet arthur is sorta pudgy as a reflection of how he thinks ("not in the face! not in the face!"). well, if I were to be let go so that I actually feel the way I really feel, I'm pretty certain that I would quickly gain a perfect body like the tick's.

instead, I'm tuned to feeling like someone who's pudgy would feel (which is probably how many subcribers to my perception feel), I take in the way that they feel and then find a way to feel good anyway. I notice that I'm constantly making tons of improvements. I may have a pudgy body now, but give me a few years and it'll start to look really good. why? because despite the numerous setbacks, I'm constantly finding ways to feel better, so I'm kinda finding ways to feel better faster than they can find ways to cause me to feel worse. eventually I'll outpace their capabilities and you'll notice my body getting way way more attractive, simply because I've gotten so good at feeling the way I want.

to prove my point, it's probably the case that many of the nosebook guys would get pretty pudgy if they sat around all day like me, and potentially look even worse, but they use artificial techniques to improve their strength and appearance (symbolised by the belt).

---

so finally we come to the little wooden boy. imagine for a moment that carmelita (little brown one) is symbolic of andrea, and they sorta get infatuated with her and her father's inventions which give them abilities like flight. arthur is telling carmelita that he thinks that the tick felt threatened by her, and it jumps over to the tick sad saying something that I completely disagree with (kinda), "you know little wooden boy, the worst sin in the world is disloyalty".

loyalty is sorta in the same vein as @[blahblog](2022-05-18 21:27) where I talk about doing what I feel like doing. if I'm loyal to someone, I'm doing what they expect from me given the our current relationship status (see first note in @[blahblog](2022-05-14 12:24)), which makes disloyalty definitely a *sin* -- but "sin" is just a greater relationship between you and your superior deity -- so again, it's an expectation, and I'm liable to do what I want to do, not what I'm expected to do.

so now imagine for a moment that I also represent the swiss industrial spies. I also fit that symbol as well, because I'm sorta "above the law" in that, if I were to develop a system (like the "party LAN" project), there isn't a whole lot they could do to stop me. for anyone else, they can do all sorts of stuff to dissuade them from developing something that threatens their monopoly, but for me, it's much more difficult. the major problem that most other people have with such a system is they simply don't believe in theirselves enough to do it, and if they do, they've already turned to the dark side.

the idea here is that eventually, my own (woke california blowhard) pontification will cause me to have to give up the little wooden boy..

I've been trying to figure out what the little wooden boy represents, and so following the idea that carmelita is symbolic of andrea, during that time, I adopted the perpetual evolution-of-desire approach to life. I don't want to actually get any manifestations, not for any other reason that I need or want them, but because I want to become the embodiment of that manifestation rather than having the manifestation itself.

so let's say that's the wooden boy, right? that means that I have to burn the evolution-of-desire aspect allowing whatever to manifest so that I can have nosebook back as my sidekick?

see how it just doesn't make sense? I've given up on the party LAN idea and I think it's totally cool if they use that technology to keep me "forever" held away from my connection, because I know that I'll eventually get to feeling so good (even without my connection), that I'll still feel really amazing and have a body to match.

### 2022-06-01 17:27 - venus and adonis

after writing @[sitchin/thoughts](2022-06-01 04:44), I've been thinking about the venus and adonis (dumuzi) play by shakespere. I haven't read it, but I did read its synopsis on wikipedia a while back. the jist of it is that adonis wants to work really badly and his work causes his own death because of his denial of venus.

I think I used that allegory a while back to say that I don't deny venus or try to fight against her advances because that will backfire on me. I'll experience the unwanted aspect of my own concept of trying to fight her.

---

this time I would like to look at the story from a whole different angle... so, the sirians say that venus comes from the same material as ra/marduk/zeus/jupiter which is a silica based crystalline structure that glows -- and sure enough, if you look out in the morning a month ago venus and jupiter will be in the morning sky right next to each other glowing. venus is a little brighter because it's closer, but they look pretty similar.

the sirians identify ra as a 3rd ray male emitter and venus as a 3rd ray female. the difference there is that ra takes in a concept (5) and outputs a structure, while venus takes in a structure and outputs another structure. this is pretty important because this will greatly influence their behaviour.

I also haven't got to the part of the story where dumuzi is killed, but I did notice the parallels to the story with senmut and hatshepsut. I do know that dumuzi receives a dream (a symbolic interaction, structure) of things that fortell his future -- a "fate" -- and then after his interaction with innana/venus he falls right into the trap and that structure becomes a reality.

I believe this is a very similar story to the "venus and adonis" story by shakespere.

---

the next thing that I want to talk about, is the form of perception of these reborn-deities. when looking over the pantheon outlined by the sirians, the females cover most of the primary layers of perception (1, 3, (not 5), and 7), with the only exception being isis (-2). the males fall into two basic categories: the ones that had a sacrficial/memorable death are: jeortau (+2), saturn (+-4), and osiris (+-6-+).

I'm considering saturn to be roughly similar to saturn, but also is extremely similar to osiris. the place where they're similar is that their deaths happen around a celebration. if you'll remember, so is jesus' death as well. right after the celebrated entrance (palm sunday), he gets "betrayed" and then sentenced to death. both asar/osiris and dumuzi met their demise after a celebration, as well.

---

osiris (6) is betrayed by ra (3).
dumuzi (4?) is betrayed by innana (3).
jeortau (2) is betrayed(?) by anu (1).

man, I'm really struggling here for some reason... I'll just explain what I see...

a celebration is a time when you feel better than you normally do. what happens vibrationally is an image (6) gets created which makes a structure (3) during the celebration -- and because you feel better than you normally do, it's easy to see that structure optimistically. however later, when back to normal, that structure gets turned into reality.

I really can't think here... I need to come back to this.

breadmaster
opposite 7th ray and 3rd ray interactions

### 2022-06-03 22:44 - the breadmaster and events

I still need to finish up the previous thing on venus and adonis' connection to the breadmaster, but I was listening to snake-bros #059 - strangeness in the woods (I think) and there was a story about these two guys out in the woods that heard this sound of water running and it sounded really nice and he'd never thought that running water sounded so nice but it sounded so nice him and his buddy (without saying anything to each other) both decided to get up and start looking for the source of the water. he said that the sound started to get more and more playful sounding, really wanting them to go into the woods to look for it, but it kept getting fainter...

he finally decided to get out of there because when he stopped and was trying to figure the thing out (with his logical mind) rather than just following his feelings/desire, suddenly he started to feel a sinister feeling rather than the pleasurable and playful water sound from before. when they finally decided to leave, playful water from before converted into a sinister feeling of being watched.

I look at this two ways: I consider this the difference between rational and emotional thinking (perhaps right/left brain). there is this constant battle between the rational way of looking at things (something is trying to lure me into the forest) and the just having fun and being playful, so there's nothing to worry about. I tend to err on the side of emotional thinking. if I'm feeling something playful and fun, then that's what I'm attracting, and it's fine. if someone tries to convert that playful and fun feeling into something of terror, they'll have a different experience than I do. I'll seemingly walk away from the situation having had a fun time even though some weird stuff happened.

what I'm saying is that, what I think happened in that event is that the guy and his buddy were having a really fun and playful time in the forest, and so that feeling started to manifest as a sound of running water that was really playful. however, then he started to try and begin to figure it out logically and that's when that feeling of awesome turned into something sinister. if he had of kept feeling more and more playful, he probably would have manifest something of that sort into reality. likewise, if, instead of noping out, he stayed to find out the sinister feeling that too would have manifested into more and more physical reality.

---

I brought that story up because it directly correlates with what I want to talk about. there's this idea that is very common that says that you can be lured into a bad situation with pleasure. I personally subscribe to this, and I've seen it happen over and over with drugs, sex, and party situations where -- when feeling better than normal, we're more inclined to believe someone or to be tricked by someone with ulterior motives.

as such, I have spoken many times about the difference between genuine good-feeling because of perception and a temporary good-feeling because of pleasure. when feeling better than normal/usual, it's been my experience that if I keep that up for any length of time, a crash and burn is eminent.

---

so first let's look at the venus and adonis idea. he must know or have associated the concept of extended pleasure as being a prerequisite to crash and burn. dumuzi and many others have crashed and burned after venus turned up the speed of reality creation. this is very commonly the case with coke and other artificial means of causing one to feel better than normal[^1]. so, combatting this, adonis, learning from dumuzi's mistake goes the opposite direction and decides to engage himself in his work instead of engaging in pleasure which leads to rapid reality creation.

this gives me the opportunity to talk about the differences between 3rd ray and 7th ray: venus was a 3rd ray, so that means she inputs perception and pathfinding logic toward desire and then outputs the same. if adonis' only desire is to hook up with a hot chick, then you can imagine his dismay when he finds out that it wasn't nearly all he had imagined it to be, and so now he's sorta left with nothing (OK, now what do I do? I just fulfilled my desire?) so, he engages himself in his work[^2] because work is stable (it doesn't leave you), and work doesn't talk back or critisise you (he's a self-employed hunter), and so work is a pretty stable source of good-feeling for him.

I can't remember the story, but venus, because she didn't get her way with him, tells him he's going to die (structure), and so somehow he ends up believing her pathfinding logic rather than following his own feelings and follows the same path as dumuzi. so, dumuzi crashed and burned because of venus and pleasure and adonis crashed and burned because he believed her structure more than his own.

that's a 3rd ray, though; a 7th ray is a bit different, and I haven't totally figured it out, but what I do know is that structure is arrived to by a 7th ray from the ground-up, as opposed to the 3th ray's top-down (prophetic) approach. the 3rd ray says the path and things have to extend outward in the intended form of creation. as an example enki and ninmah are constantly manipulating things from the top down to try and make things satisfying or pleasurable, but the 7th ray (like ningishzidda) takes current circumstances and then adjusts things so that they can conform to the requirements.

it's kind of the opposite approach too. I think of this as strarting with a lot of data, use the imagination to figure out the concept (frequency/feeling) behind that data, and then from there try to figure out how to harmonise that with the rest of the creation. the 3rd ray approach is to create the things, and then set them out into the wild and just sorta let them figure out how to come into harmony with each other (often times leading to disastrous or "baffling" results).

---

so now, when looking at the breadmaster, let's look at the symbols and their progression.

the bread that the breadmaster bakes tastes pretty good, but it causes tick to feel lethargy, sleepiness, and a desire to stay where he's at and give up.

I haven't figured out the bread college thing, but the breadmaster is pissed off that he got expelled from the baking college. he places a loaf in there and the tick eats it. it seems to be something to do with getting expelled. I'm not the breadmaster, so I don't understand that part.

the breadmaster decides he wants to bake a suffle that will entirely consume the city (presumably putting them in the same state as tick of lethargy, warmth and sleepiness). he orders some ingredients or else they're going to increase bread bombings. the mayor (US govt) of the city (nosebook) agrees to give him the ingredients he needs. it's pretty safe to say that the suffle has something to do with sex, with the goal being lethargy and sleepiness.

the breadmaster can bake the suffle without sugar, and so he does in the munincipal pool. the suffle is expanding rapidly consuming the whole city, so they get human bullet to shoot tick out of the gun to destroy the suffle.

the tick asks for a triple charge and the human bullet says that'll destroy a man. tick thinks he's not normal.

well, those words of a triple charge have stuck in my head. a while back I noticed that the solar flares that register as c-class flares feel to me like m or x-class flares. I postulated that this along with other data that the GOES x-ray flux meter is registering a whole order of magnitude lower than it should (so a c-flare is really an m-flare). well, around the time of my birthday, it was constantly in the c-range. shortly thereafter, the flux went down to b-range (it's possible a sunspot rotated off of the disk -- didn't check), but the solar activity that's associated with the episodes where I leave my body and start to see images totally did not decrease, but actually have increased the last few days. the readout *says* b-range, but my body *feels* like it's in m or x-range. I also had the sensation that's what it meant by "double, no triple charge" -- so that means were on double charge now and we have to get to triple.

the tick gets shot out of the cannon and explodes the suffle. so, the suffle which was previously consuming the city (nosebook), now has blanketed in suffle (it looks like snow) and tick says, "the city looks almost peaceful under a blanket of freshly fallen suffle" -- so sleep and lethargy are turned into "almost peaceful".

---

there is this part too when they figure out it's at the munincipal swimming pool. they go there and instead of just confronting him, the tick does an unusually large dive off of the diving board before capturing them. after being captured, they realise the suffle is self-baking and can't be stopped -- so that's why they go to the human bullet.

what this seems to imply is that before the shooting of the gun, there is a pretty epic nosedive. this gives the impression that they have to find some way to do that thing that venus does where dumuzi is lured into venus' trap using a celebration of some sorts. this better than normal feeling is then used to cause him to destroy himself -- or, in this case, do a pretty epic nosedive.

I don't really mind that they can try to attempt that all they want, but my goal is to just keep feeling "normal". and so, like adonis, I tend to keep my distance from anything that feels good.

these sorts of things are one thing where if I go after it, or try to go at it logically, like the guys in the forest, that playful feeling will turn sinister pretty quickly.

the solution to this is neither to push venus away or to go after her. both of those result in disaster. the only way to go about it is to just stick to myself and keep doing my own thing. she'll eventually find her way up to me. it's the law of attraction, not the law of running away. if I tried to attract venus using physical means or some other gimmick, it would definitely backfire because once the path to that desire is fulfilled (and it'll never be everything you wanted[^3]), so then what next?

---

so then the last thing is, I woke up this morning thinking about the concept of "going infinite" -- the idea where I continually self-sabotage infinitely and "never" get to the manifestation.

it was in the context of this whole thing with nosebook. nobody can stop me from self-sabotaging. if I have too good of conditions, I get connected and so therefore can manipulate the timeline so that I sabotage myself, and it's kinda a bad idea (though they could if they wanted) to kill me -- but then again, what if I just reinserted myself? my point is, there's nobody that can stop me from self-sabotage. I can do it infinitely, so what that means is that you could eventually imagine that the manifestation would get so big that we're talking about much much more than just sex or something -- as in, if there isn't anything this planet, galaxy, or solar system can offer, what would happen then?

I've postulated a lot about this idea because there are physical limitations, but then couldn't I sabotage myself by figuring out a technology which can surpass those physical limitations and then go back to sabotage again?

it seems there's no limit to how much I can keep doing this, so why not just keep doing it? I don't actually have to make any movement.

---

this reminded me of a thing a long time ago, when I was thinking about effortless power and the idea of fighting using the technique, because you don't really want to make any movement because the opponent can always turn it against you. the most effortless is to always let them exert the effort. so, you would end up fighting others that also know this, and fights with them end in a stalemate. there would be no way for me to ever "win" if I fought someone who neither wanted to make the first move.

fortunately, this isn't the case. nosebook is filled with the alpha types that want to make the first move, so I don't ever have to worry about them deciding to stop making the first move. I can just stay put forever. I don't need to go toward venus or away from her either, so I guess we'll have to see what ends up happening. she can try to define a structure, but that effort will just get amplified and reflected back[^4]. she's got to find her way into my structure instead trying to put me inside of hers.

there's probably a limit somewhere, but I don't know where that would be -- as in, is this the beginnings of the creation of a new universe? ...they did say "matured". I just don't know...

the conclusion that I came to this morning though is, if I'm hell-bent on trying to exploit myself in every possible way to ensure I "never" get the manifestation, then that means that you guys have to create what you want. don't wait for me to create what you want.

well, I can tell you what'll happen: I'll keep finding my connection and self-sabotaging until eventually there won't be a way to self-sabotage anymore. I wonder if that's what "perfected 7th ray" means.

---

you wanted to undo the breadmaster symbols. how's that?

[1]: which is why I think in the woods they were probably feeling pretty good and that's what caused the initial event

[2]: or finds a hobby, as the pua guides suggest

[3]: I can't really describe this concept very well, but my experience has shown me that whenever the goal is a woman, it leads to unhappiness. the most common sensation of it is that the physical manifestation was never as good as hoped for. it never meets expectations, and most guys come away usually kinda upset that she's so moody or whatever. I've also noticed that women are a pretty good reflection of their partner, so the objective to finding a good woman that won't turn into a disaster is to not be a disaster yourself. it never satisfies. you can only truly find satisfaction by yourself. trying to do it with another person always amplifies your own dissatisfaction (peaceful, *for now*).

[4]: I want to talk about this more, but my brain is mush right now.

### 2022-06-15 18:37 - the parent improvement push and pull

I noticed another resonance between conversations. at becky's house she said that her mom was some way, which she also said she was the same way (can't remember what it was now), so I asked if she was like her mom. she explained to me that she was as different from her mom as something is to another very distant thing.

I could feel what she was saying and it reminded me of my father and me. I thought myself to be very different from him, but in reality we're quite alike. at some point I stopped trying to be different than him and accepted that we were pretty similar, and then along with that I decided I wanted to improve on all of the aspects that we share, adapt them and do them better.

---

later on in the car, I was talking with mom about dani and how I realised that he wanted for me to be constante/consistent, but that wasn't actually what he really wanted, because it was sorta the thing of drinking around sober people -- even while drunk, I can see my own ridiculousness through their eyes, so because I don't want to see myself as ridiculous, I want them to get drunk with me so we're on the same level. in reality, neither dani or I wanted to actually be sober or lucid.

I then talked with mom about how we think we want something, but then we don't actually want it because we don't contemplate the reality change to make that happen.

I didn't really correlate the conversations, but it's the same thing. parents want their kids to be better than them and to do better (just like dani wanted me to be constant), but they don't *actually* want it, in a lot of cases, because it means their kid will actually be better at it.

so then I warped back to the conversation with becky and I was thinking about how that parents interact with their kids and want the kids to be *different* because they don't want them to be *better*. so I constructed an example: imagine that sarah wanted her daughters to make it through adolescence without all of the problems and stuff, so she wants them to take a different path than she did -- and so she wants her kids to be *different* than she is, but not necessarily better.

what if her kids were to find a way to get through all of their adolescence without all of the regret[^1] and to improve on their trajectory *without* doing it differently. what if they just figured out how to the same thing, better?

---

my point is, we want things for other people, but we don't actually think about what the future would be like if that were actually true.

this whole thing is also a resonance to the father's day card as well. it's kinda funny how that kicked this whole thing off.

[1]: I can't say for sure this is what she felt, but as I was carrying becky's[^2] dresses, I was feeling sarah and it felt like lots of mistakes, bad decisions, underappreciation for her beauty, and stuff like that. hard to put it all into words.

[2]: I don't know how this happened because I was carrying becky's dresses, but one of them she mentioned sarah and the dress she bought for prom or something and I caught the feeling as she said that. I don't know where the feelings come from. anyway, somewhere in there, I felt the same feeling of her mom wanting becky to be different from her, and she was, but there seemed like there was also a "this is what I had to go through so this is why I'm the way I am, and when you go through it, you'll see and be just like I am, even though I want you to be different" -- sorta feeling.

### 2022-07-02 12:12 - the emperor's new groove

two days ago I watched the emperor's new groove and it resonated a lot with me. I absolutely love that movie and have seen it probably about 10-15 earlier on in my childhood.

anyway, last night after writing about pluto in @[metal-lucifer](2022-06-29 00:54), it kinda struck me that the story there may have some resonances. I have decided that I want to make pluto+charon the centre of the new galaxy. simultaneous to this, randall (I'm pretty sure) has identified his location for "the new earth" as pluto.

OK, so in the story kuzco wants to place his waterpark "kuzcotopia" on the hill where pacha is living with his wife and two kids. I assume this resonates because of my plans to make pluto the one side where basically me, the girls that can figure out how to feel the way they want to feel, and probably anyone else who can do the same (hence the waterpark). well, at the end of the story, kuzco decides that the hills don't actually sing and so he'll settle for putting his park on the hill next to it (ie charon).

well, I was never really married to the idea of pluto exactly. that was just the same of the duo in the sky. even when I discussed the idea with jaron a while back, I didn't really have a preference one way or another what one it was going to be, but I did visualise it as going in the direction of being similar to sirius A/B -- where the smaller, denser, higher frequency one (sirius B) would be us.

the whole plan was that opposite us, the other one would be a planet that is very conditionally oriented -- meaning they need large stone structures and magnificent stuff to feel good -- which we'll make possible for them. their whole objective for us will be to constantly be more and more dissatisfied with their conditions, no matter how good they get.

so, if I view the good-condition-lovers as the pacha hill, the symbols checks out. I clearly represent kuzco, but at the same time, I'm also very much kronk, because I'm cheerful to continue to help yzma, who's trying to kill me. yzma is most probably symbolic of the US govt, and or the ones that are trying to constantly manipulate and take over any power that I have. she can't kill me completely because I carry her around on her back and do whatever she commands me to do (mostly, cept for important stuff like killing kuzco).

pacha likes the good conditions of his hill, and the family heritage (preservation of sacred geometry and other ceremony/ritual things passed down through the generations). this for me is the snake-bros -- not any one of them specifically, the enki side of things. I am the opposition to pacha's desire to preserve his good conditions, and so I fit the proud egotistical punk that just wants what he wants and doesn't matter if it interfere's with the "good guys" plans -- so alalu/phoenix.

in the story pacha has to try and make friends with kuzco to preserve his good conditions and family heritage, and they do that through a journey through the jungle (difficult and dangerous -- physical) conditions, and have to save eachother's lives a few times each and work together.

I think that working together stuff is all great, and it reminded me of a video on navy submarines that I saw on smartereverday. cool stuff, but not my kind of thing. give commands and help each other out all you want "grab my hand!" "we can do this!" "dive submarine whatever" -- all really awesome stuff, and it feels good to get stuff done with people's lives on the line, but not my thing. I like effortless.

---

so I don't really think that the story is very symbolic in the sense of actually working together and helping eachother out -- because that's not my thing. I'm waiting until I'm connected -- period, because then everything is effortless. getting transportation and everything won't be that hard, and then I have to setup the thing where the vibration of pluto is linked to charon and they can worry about hooking into our transformed vibration somehow -- which suggests to me that they're going to need to figure out how to work together with the US govt, not me.

I'm not really against their plan. my plan *includes* heritage and good-condition-lovers. if anything, their kuzco may actually be the US govt more than anything.

---

as for the rest of the planet, I don't really know or care. none of that is really my problem. the snake-bros are the ones that will figure out how to run the show. their dissatisfaction with what's happening on the planet, will -- instead of causing a micronova -- fuel us to create more energy.

once the system is setup, there will be such an abundance of good energy and good conditions on earth and in the whole system, nobody will really notice how dissatisfied they are with everything. if anyone thinks the amount of dissatisfaction projected my direction is a lot, it's going to be much much much more by the time all of this happen, so anyone can come to charon with me, but I don't think anyone without the capability to transform bad-feeling perceptually will have a very miserable time.

in fact, I will postulate that the amount of dissatisfaction will continue to rise very rapidly because populations will continue to grow and fertility rates will continue to increase as well because of the better and better conditions. more people = more energy and it's unlikely that anyone of those people will actually figure out how to transform that energy.

it's also going to create another problem too because as our planet begins to vibrate stronger and stronger with dissatisfaction, it'll basically become impossible for anyone to come and join us on our planet[^1], as our planet will be a veritable hell -- pure hatred and dissatisfaction to be felt anywhere near to the planet. this will constantly get transformed by us, and I think we'll become something like sirius B, but perhaps even higher frequency than that. very inhospitable.

so that's how I take that story... lol.

[1]: not 100% sure about this, because maybe if they were to have some setup that could cancel the signal or something, they could visit, but I doubt it would be a very comfortable place for them to stay.

### 2023-02-09 16:52 - sovereign cure

I've been thinking a lot about various plays of shakespere: in merchant of venice, shylock (shirlock) which is a representation of me has to go for the letter of the law, but then recedes his demands. he's then forced to convert over to christianity. for me, this is the idea of having to stray from my beliefs; I simply will not. I've also been contemplating the paul character in "last days of night" -- even though I've only made it through the first two chapters, so it's kinda hard to tell much of it. also, notice in the tick, in the dino neil episode, when the tick is fighting the dinosaur, there's this one part where the dino's pants catch on fire and he says, "liar liar, pants on fire" -- which reminds me of the movie "liar liar" that I watched a long time ago, and was one amongst many of the things that suggested to me that I should only say what I believed to be the truth -- no matter how awkward or inappropriate it is. I'm starting to get there. today was a pretty big milestone to me because instead of letting the poor woman read me the doctor's report, I said my mind. I'm very proud of how far I've come, and I'm nearly to the level of jim carrey in liar liar.

I've been thinking about myself a lot in the context of a lawyer lately, because I write a lot of crazy stuff here and it's all public, and I'll gladly defend all of it (as being an accurate representation of what I believed when I wrote it), and use the opportunity of such an imaginary trial to demonstrate that everything is attraction. I kinda even want someone to take me to court for talking about some of these topics so that I can just really go explicit with my arguments -- you know, cause in court, as long as it pertains to the trial, there are no taboos as to what is able to be said.

so, for example, imagine for a moment that someone accused me of being a pedophile. I would present all of the evidence that I can to prove that this is a reflection of my accuser's perception, and then conclude that there *is* in fact evidence of whether I am a pedophile, because the entirety of my life has been recorded since at least 2012, and potentially since birth even -- so there is positive proof one way or another. that argument will probably not be admitted, so therefore, I will have run out of arguments to prove my innocence.

at that point, I'll have to make the point that I believe in a thing called timelines, and so there are an infinite number of timelines that could have arrived me to the present moment, and almost certainly some of those I definitely would have been a pedophile, so therefore, I can't positively say for certain that I am or am not a pedophile. inclusively, if I take the perception of having gained universal consciousness, then I most certainly *am* a pedophile, because they exist in this universe, and that is a part of who I am.

I would be an interesting lawyer, to say the least...

what I would *not* be doing is making things up to try and prove to the jury that I am not a pedophile because I don't have anything conclusive to say that I am not, nor to do I feel myself to be one, I simply will not engage in a "noble lie" to prove something that I cannot prove. if my accuser says it's so, I find it quite possible that they could come from a timeline where I was, and so therefore I will have to accept my guilt in their form of perception. the only thing I can do is reflect back to the person what they see in me. that's it.

---

now, in two gentlemen of verona, there is this idea of valentine (cupid), which I identify with giving away his woman sylvia to proteus. [I mentioned to tim](/nance-notes.md#2023-01-30-0414---merchant-of-venice) that I understand this prespective if I consider sylvia to be a project of my own. consider now the party-LAN idea that I've put out and [reacted to when jason presented a similar idea in promethian pirate](/jorjani-thoughts.md#2022-12-05-2203---the-neo-feudal-system), which for me would be something synonymous to sylvia. I really like this idea and have been working on different aspects of it all my life, from unhosted to the last many years of figuring out how tesla's world system works and trying to figure out how to adapt it to be for the human aura. I've been talking this idea up a bunch like valentine talks up sylvia. if I were to launch it, I would do the software entirely on encryption and integrate it with something like erlang/elixir. for the hashing system, robert edward grant's "sovernign" hashing functions would probably be the best because I would want infinite length symetric hashing to essentially verify the data and stuff. well, that sure sounds like the system that jason was talking about there.

also, in that play, there is this weird little interlude where valentine (cupid), takes a trip through the forest and meet up with some outlaws...

lastly, in [my comments to john anthony on video 45](/correspondance.md#2023-02-02-1458---video-45), I was linking the two pillars of sacrifice in Rom X of bulls and goats to show that these are the two pillars of the era that we're in. the fisher kings are over (picsis), and now we're moving into the next era here which is either fire (zarathustra) or water (aquarius), depending on how you look at it. I noted that the gemini capstone to the 17 pyramid sonnets has one that is notably fire and the other water. sonnet 153 is especially noteworthy because it talks about a "ſoueraigne cure". I'd like to expand on that sonnet a bit before explaining the main idea.

the sonnet has interesting italics in it. C is a big letter, then "*Vpid*" is itallicised. that word looks a lot to me like "vapid" -- as in vapidshamen, one of my names. also, it has this weird imagery about cupid having "ſtrang malladies" for which there is a sovereign cure, and a growing "bath" (of fire -- which considering the other sonnets is some ridiculous heat). in addition to this, there is a whole bit about his I/eye being sick, but at the end Cupid gets a new fire: "my mistres eye".

I want to mention that when I was writing that correspondance to john anthony, I was getting the sense (because of the correlations to hamlet) that there are *two* major players here. one of them is on one pole (of water) and the other is on the pole of fire (ie the one facing toward the sun) in my [setup of pointing the pole at the sun](/nikki-ana-jones.md#2023-01-28-1025---micronovas-and-stuff), and so I figure one will be the master of the ocean (the pirates) and the other the master of fire. I never really came to an conclusions on this one, because the moon, for example has it's heavy side facing away from the star (earth), meanwhile if we point the south pole at the sun, that's the same configuration as the moon, but that means the fire (sun) is pointing mostly at the ocean. remember too that the two pillars are of taurans and saturnians. saturn is stationed at the south pole, and zarathustra (vulcan/santa) is on the north, so it looks as if it would be the opposite setup.

to further complicate my confusion on this one, in sonnet 55 (this corresponds with the 2038 thing), there is a clear reversal of roles, where saturn is now on the receiving end of things (which means that south pole is pointing toward the sun). all in all, I'm sorta confused and I don't really know what to do about it until there's more open conversation about it (which is why I'm putting it out here).

in either case, it looks to me that valentine takes a trip to meet the outlaws at some point, and I'll meet a sad and distempered guest (unhappy to see me) -- which sounds about right because imagine how much more and more I'll be (from their perspective) manipulating things -- and it'll be somewhat of a "pyrrhic" victory (pyre sounds like fire to me).

OK. that's enough symbols to explain the idea now.

---

I've been [considering the caskets in the merchant of venice](/nance-notes.md#2023-02-08-1748---deserve-is-a-false-reflection), and [consequences to actions in terms of reflection](/nance-notes.md#2023-02-09-0556---followup-consequences-for-actions-and-doing-what-i-feel), and I've come to conclude that in a social system like the one that we're in now, pay special attention to the reminder from mom that there are consequences to actions in a social system. I also brought up the idea of yes-yes-yes-no vs no-no-no-yes (which is greater) -- and while I personally don't see a difference between the two (because good and bad no longer exist to me), these are both people that are not ready for a manifestation and so are therefore resisting its apparition until they feel ready for it. however, the example I gave was one of underage girls -- cause I wanted to pick the most provactive one possible for maximum impact.

as I demonstrated above, I don't really want to try and argue that I'm not a pedophile, and neither do I want to convert to a black hat like my proteus (former white hat) did, and start telling "noble lies" or anything like that. I like how I am, and have no intention of trying to be anything other than that. therefore, I'm going to stick to the letter of the law. I wanted to make a fire in the backyard to burn the weeds (notice the symbols), but mom insisted that I follow the letter of the law.

I mean, it's possible that I could end up with older girls, but *why*? it's not on my objective of things to do. I've given up on the party-LAN idea (sylvia) now and I would like to work on things my own way, and so I have some ideas on software and potential future hardware too that can do just that. hold that thought.

the first sonnets suggest that I (cause I take everything personally), should procreate and leave heirs behind -- however I don't really find that to be necessary. the idea of making physical heirs as a reflection of myself isn't really in my mission statement. I'd rather move my consciousness into a girl's body and *demonstrate* how to do what I do from a woman's perspective -- that way they can learn for theirselves, rathar than to rely on genetics. this route is also the effortless route (my preferred one).

I also mentioned that I'm a reflector at the moment (helena), and because of my form of perception, my reflection is a good one (I see their good aspects), so the outlaws part makes sense -- however, I don't really want to be the traditional silver (7th ray) reflector. instead, I want to be a *black* (1st ray) reflector -- as in, ultra-dense hydrogen. my reflection can be whatever I desire it to be, and so therefore I don't need others around me to be the thing that I want to reflect, but instead I can, on my own power, have have the qualities and aspects that I desire; I can create all of the elements. this is the 4th T form of perception: the idea that I'm a reflector on one side, and an actor on the other -- both sides reflective, but one side is purposeful, and so can be anything from lead to gold. this concept also fits in to my symbols of ending (for me) the era of mutual-back-scratching and starting a new era of feeling-purposefully.

the inspiration to my software comes from a lot of different places, namely starting with some time travelers in berlin and the symbols of "mechanicofthesequence" -- something I tried to start with patricia but was unable, my computer was subsequently stolen, and I instead went back to spain and took the raquel path. however, the idea has lingered for quite a while. it's a non-physical (software) approach to the party-LAN project and it's quite ambitious. I've decided I want to take the bottom-up approach to it, rathar than the top-down approach of party-LAN. the destination is both the same: the ability to control my computer and communicate with others using emotion and concepts, but the approach is starting on software, and will potentially not have hardware that interfaces with the emotions directly. the communication interface will all be indirect. because of the power of my thoughts and emotions (cause of low resistance), my "honest" approach will be able to have enough power to influence aspects of the machine indirectly, allowing me to continue to be as direct as possible with my thoughts and words.

the other major source of inspiration on this project comes from andreas: he just decided to build an operating system after a crash and burn of reality. it was his kind of return back into a system of structure and organisation. this project is similar to me in that way. so, as you can see, I'm an actor and andreas is the character, meaning that I'm well on my way to being getting that *black* reflector goal of mine. I don't really mind being the actor in this case, as it seems to me like something that I want to be doing.

in conclusion, I feel like it's probably best for me to stick to the letter of the law for a while. meanwhile I continue to exist in the social sttructure that I'm in (I'm an american citizen), I should continue to live by those rules. I suppose it's possible to join another social system: I tried to do that already in spain, considering myself to be basically spanish (notice the prince of aragon and silver), but that didn't work out. because of hyper-individuality, I feel myself to be more "sovereign" than anything. the idea for them, is that out in the ocean, there aren't any rules or laws, so anyone can do whatever they want. on land, you have to obey the rules of the land -- and I've demonstrated over and over that it's not a good idea to say, "you need to change what you're doing (or your rules) so that I can feel good." -- and neither do I recommend anyone else try and affect behaviour or change, either.

### 2023-02-16 17:00 - if thine eie causes you to sin...

PLUCK IT OUT

I was watching a james cameron interview on charlie rose. he's talking about the titanic and the powerful symbol that it was at the bottom of the ocean. he connected to the powerful emotion of the event by seeing it (the same way that I feel/experience a prerson's aura/touch) and so what he did is he made the story less about the awfulness of the past and turned the awfulness of the facts into a tragedy as a tragic love story.

I can see when he's explaining this the saturnian 4th ray perception where if there is one event let's say in the (19)20's and then we connect to that moment in the future, some of the energy of that moment can be transformed into emotion in the present. therefore, the story focuses instead on this couple, jack and rose (interviewed by charlie rose) and their getting to know each other. jack is described similar to how I see myself, where everyone is just a person to me. nobody is especially famous or anything like that (which is because I see/respond to a person's aura, not their story/fame/glory) yet at the same time looks at you with xerox eyes.

james mentions his mentor(?) roger corman. charlie notices that a lot of good film directors come from roger corman's school. james says that it's more like whomever *survives* him. I get a good laugh out of this concept because james presents him as this very difficult and unnecessarily (irrationally) fickle guy. I have to know more about him so I [search him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Corman), and I notice that he made a movie called "[man with x-ray eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X:_The_Man_with_the_X-ray_Eyes)". I read the film's plot and it's about a guy that keeps getting the range of his vision increased in both amplitude (seeing eventually the centre of the universe), and also in bandwidth (seeing UV, x-ray and beyond). this reminds me again of me, and also matches his description of jack having xerox eyes (he sees right through people). btw, there's this interesting tidbit in the plot summary where it says that at first, he (xerox/xavier) notices that he can see through people's clothing, and then right after that he saves this girl by seeing through her clothing and outer tissue layers to notice she has a disease. his ability to pierce though the outer layers of clothing (facade) and of organic matter, *proves* to his doubters of his ability that he has extended depth of perception.

this xavier guy reminds he of the "poor" guys out there that are trying to keep their speed at the same as mine. I was explaining to jaron this morning how the filters and understanding of something (its concept), I believe comes from the female side as is encoded into our DNA in the x-chromosome. I explained that reducing resistance increases amplitude of the signal -- and, at significant enough amplitude, it no longer becomes unnoticeable (ie. you perceive more, but it could be uncomfortable to experience so much), much like what is happening to xavier. he now sees way further (because he put in eyedrops (a condition)) and now he's starting to suffer because he sees way more than he normally would be allowed to do; the eyedrops kind of reduce the resistance in his eyes.

wisdom (chokma) is depth of perception, but understanding (binah) is a diffreent thing entirely. one can decrease the resistance in their eyes to see a lot, but if one does not *understand* what they're seeing, it can cause great discomfort. when talking about this, this morning, I was explaining to jaron that block out (attenuate) signal of all concepts for which we don't understand, so when we understand them they're there but it's not a problem. it's not perceived as a danger, and so therefore we don't experience fear or heartbreak in response to it.

the next thing I notice is that he made a film called "massacre of st. valentines day" and it's about the roaring 20's, to which again, like with the titanic film, I can see a fulcrum where on one end is the 1920's and the other end is the 60's when the film is released, where the emotion of the moment in the past is carried into the present (1967) and *reunderstood* in a new way. this seems to be a way of evening out time from a saturnian perspective. each of these events and their subsequent films puts a damper on the present moment so long as we don't *understand* the events, we'll feel negative emotion when watching the film.

the films transmit a number of emotions that interact with those filters that come pre-installed in the x-chromosome, and so, like jaron was saying, "freudian psychology is that you say one thing and mean your mother", *is* what these films are doing when they tug our heartstrings (like a lyre). we perceive the aura/emotion of the moment and we're drawn into the experience *as if we were there* -- and those that experience a negative reaction to the moment are doomed to repeat the same emotion again, but in the frame of the reinterpetation -- so for example, in the frame of the titanic, this is a giant unsinkable ship and now the new tragedy is the ideal/perfect love relationship between jack and rose that comes to an aburpt halt by a few seemingly unlucky circumstances, where just the perfect storm sank the unsinkable boat.

closing tabs, I then notice that the concept of the man with x-ray eyes is used on a bauhaus album (which -- bauhaus is one of the things that james mentioned seeing on the titanic in the submersible). anyway, I want to hear the song so [I look at the almum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_(Bauhaus_album)). one [song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Passion_of_Lovers) really stands out to me...

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqeTq56zmvo)

you see, earlier on (before talking to jaron upstairs) I was watching [merry wives of windsor](https://youtu.be/dWidgvOlsTY), which is just an absolutely fabulous presentation. while watching it, I was trying to identify with the characters (I take everything personally, and you should too), but the problem is I'm not at all identifying with fenton. instead, I suppose that I identify more with anne page, but even that is stretching it a bit. I much more strongly resemble falstaff than anyone else (by description, not by appearance). this is kind of important be cause prof prospero explains to miranda to *hear*, not see (mira) and so all of the most important symbols are hidden below a few layers of imagery, first of the set in general, then of the symbols in the play, then of the homoerotic imagery, then finally behind the heroic pantheon of concepts that the various gods and goddesses represent (like the beast and his "horns"). OK, now combine that with another concept.

I was also explaining to jaron that everything that we see is a refelction of or understanding of it. depth of perception (wisdom), is *not* the same as depth of *understanding* -- and so, these filters that come pre-installed into our genetics are all the ones that our mothers' have had. for men, we alter our mothers' perception and filters as we go along, and if we have a daughter, our perceptions will be in competition with her mother's perception in side of the daughter -- but what will ultimately get passed to her sons and daughters' perception will be her version of *her mother's* filters. so, ultimately it's up to her to integrate her father's perception into her mother's by mentally modifiyg her *understanding* of things.

however, it's not easy for girls to come to new understanding and this is largely due to a few reasons: first (and foremost), eve (the original woman from which we all came), is very set in not ever changing, ever. her code works, and so therefore, it'll only get changed upon last resort: when it threatens her life; [the passion of lovers, is death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Passion_of_Lovers).

this wicked unchanging core to our perceptions is the old witch that falstaff is turned into at the end of the play and beaten down. therefore, we've been fighting against our own perception since the dawn of *Time*. lord chronos will continue to manfest ([through the office of the christ](/blahblog.md#2022-04-14-1545---whats-the-point-of-non-physical-and-desire)) a reappearance of the emotions that cause us discomfort and negative emotion into each reunderstanding of those powerful symbols of the past. I know for me, and probably many others, the event of the titanic could easily be reunderstood as abrupt end of a "perfect" relationship with someone that seems "too good to be true" (or whatever your perception of him is), like frank ford in merry wives of windsor. those relationship titanics keep getting rerefelcted over and over until perfected. this reminds me of [another film interview I just saw about "lost in translation"](https://youtu.be/nsf7cMjPa2I).

I really want to go back and read the merry wives of windor script because I can't get the whole play just watching/hearing it. I need to *read* it so that it goes through my logical brain. however, in the play, the mistress page and ford go on a rampage to illustrate to men (like mr. ford and falstaff) their own jealousy and there's a whole song and dance about their jealousy being a product of their perception, *not* of reality. I find it interesting, btw that sofia coppola's father is named francis (as in francis bacon/flute) ford (as in frank ford) and she's got another 1999 film called "virgin suicides" where it seems to me theme of a virgin falling into the hands of a not so good guy, totally destroys things. that, sorta is the theme here.

so what I was saying about this whole entire thing being a repitition of events in time until we're no loger emotionally attracting a terrible new future due to the energy put into manifestation by sex (especially with a virgin) -- right. all men's updates to the set of original filters in the x-chromosome *never* pass down further than one generation, so the only person that can actually fix/update the original problem intoduced into the genetic code of pandora/eve, can *only* by done by antoher girl -- then, she has to have kids.

interestingly enough, eve is created in the image of adam, meaning that she's a reflection of man and those sins get carried down through the generations until a girl has the audacity to claim her own identity, and not that of her mother: to become her own I/eye.

in shakespere, there is this constant tension between the "eie" (x-chromosome, imagination, 6th ray) and the I (y-chromosome, saviour, 2nd ray). what I believe it is, is that females carried a set of filters (wisdom) that allowed for quite a bit of a depth of perception -- and that was quite valued in the olde days and was the reason for the female bloodline preservation in the lineage. however, the "eie" competes with the I -- and though it allows for quite a lot depth of perception (wisdom) by having a much less resistant set of filters -- however, it doesn't give understanding, so LOA starts to go faster and faster and you'll stand filtering out more and more, and amplifying some other things, until they grow larger and larger to manifest into full-blown reality.

the peaks where these forms of understanding/perception converge to create a real disaster (like st. valentine's day massacre and the titanic), and so our own desire to understand the event from a less and less resistant perspective causes the saturnian perspective to then borrow some of that energy, and reunderstand it in a modern frame to then attract a conceptually similar crisis, which then we then turn into a reality that is a reflection of our perception.

this process is understood by understandingt the 2nd ray triad, of isis, osiris and, ra. this is before the 7th ray triad, so things are backwards from how they are now, and so you see osiris in the 6th ray (eie) perspective and isis (our sun) in the 2nd ray (I) perspective. I think that's good for now.

#### 2023-02-16 19:07 - followup: reflections

this whole thing comes down to reflections. to give you all a moment in my perspective, you have to see that eveything that happens will be a reflection of my perception -- and because I don't have a very good opinion of girls in general, meaning that there are a lot of things that I simply look at in a much more improved way. I could have daughters, but then my filters/amplifications are going to be competing with mother's understanding -- and my experience with raquel (and patricia) is that they would gain my form of perception, but then that would make her feel empty, so she would go back to talking with her mother and everytime she talked with her mother, she'd revert back to her mother's understanding of things and *dramatically* misread the situation, thinking something is happening when it's not really (like frank ford), which ultimately pulls me into a situation where I'm forced into proving her mother's understanding as *right*. raquel and patricia's mothers really need to be *right* about what concepts those symbols interactions in the sequence turn into, so therefore, I *must* manifest them for her so that the wicked witch is right. this is pretty much my main reason for feeling so unready all the time -- because I don't like the feeling of the manifestation. sure, she can cause me to feel physical pleasure, but that just causes a more intense manifestation of her own understanding of those symbols. to me, if I block out the pleasure (like thankfully nosebook does), I don't find the coming manifestation all that desirable. I really am tired of proving/manifesting other people's understanding of symbols (like jerrica), and so I feel tremendously uncomfortable all of the time.

I can only imagine that many girls *also* feel terrible always being the reflection of a man's expetations for her. she's always locked into his perception of her and so has to find a way to do things without him because (in her perception), there aren't many men that can actually allow her to be anything more than what he expects her to be. I understand (like I said above), but from the opposite angle; it sucks being a reflector, I know.

in the marry wives of windsor, when ford and page decide to team up to show men that their jealousy is a product of their perception, there's a whole homoerotic undertone where falstaff is agreeing to their condemnation saying that to pay for his for his sins against women, he's the wheeliebin for a bit (and a lot of other butty boy jokes).

just as a small connection here, I think this is a really important concept because of [the difference in attraction styles](/metal-lucifer.md#2023-01-31-0433---some-options), which is an interesting topic because fallstaff is called lucifer and the beast, I explain that the wheeliebin technique boosts attraction, meanwhile the other has the same effect (increasing amplitude), but because they operate on our percepion, one increases the distance one passes in time (saturn), meanwhile the other increases the size of something in space (jupiter). with that in mind, I'd like to point out that most of the girls that really like me have gay fathers, and so therefore these girls are all going to be manifesting their mother's understanding (concepts realised upon perceiving the interaction of the symbols) -- and so therefrore we're kind of in for a *really* rough ride here because most of thost girls mom's mothers are credited with the lifetime achievement award of turning her father gay (personified with page and ford).

what that means is that her mom is so certain that certain symbols *mean* certain things, and I've talked a lot about them, but most of them are found in self-deprecation, and not-good-enoughness -- basically all the stuff that helen and aphrodite personify in the iliad, aka eve/pandora, the reflection of man/adam that she personifies as the reason for generation after generation of paying for the original sin (the gods/adam/man's form of perception). these original forms of perception will turn into reality.

as a small anecdote to this, there was this one time when the whole andrea thing was starting to look like it was about to manifest, that I thought, "there's no way this is happening to me; this is too good to be true" -- and in that moment, I had this sinking feeling that it probaably *wouldn't* happen now because I didn't believe it, and so my not-good-enoughness manifested itself in the form of everything falling apart. it's certainly not the end of the world, like the garden of eden story makes it sound like where eve (a reflection of adam), seemingly brings an end to the world (as they knew it). the world now had to manifest in a way which was a reflection of her understanding (binah) of the symbols she's now programmed with. "the virgin suicides (1999)" is a modern retelling of that story, I would kind of think.

that was my perception. another perception is to look at this from the perception of the titanic (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/gIi36H5lvxY?t=579)):

    it's a story of some pirates looking for plunder. they're looking for wealth/riches, they're looking for jewlrey, and they find this story of this woman and she leads them to this story of this great romance between a young woman who is going over to marry a wealthy man in philadelphia -- and she falls in love with a man that *only* happens to get on the titanic because he had a poker game where we won a ticket and he's in steerage and the two of them engage -- she is pulled towards him and rebels against the man who would be her (husband) -- he's an artist, a free spirit and he paints her picture and in the painting there's a beautiful (diamond)...

first: though I match james' description of jack's personality, the symbols are all wrong. notice how the girls are more symbolically similar to jack, and me to rose (and anne page). jack is also, like fenton, a ordinary person, not very rich, and he's there pretty much by pure chance (poker luck). rose however is on her journey over to get married to a wealthy man in philadelphia, and so when she kinda changes her affections to someone that isn't the rich guy she was supposed to be with (like anne page), sex with jack happens and so that (like the garden of eden story) sorta brings down the ship. one could easily see this situation playing out, if I were to just sorta start to disregard the steering of the wealthy people at the helm of my titanic boat, and instead decide to go with a ordinary free-spirit artistic guy that wants to paint a picture of me (ie. is a reflection of me) -- where, like eve being good for adam, her being a refelction of him wasn't really all that good for those steering the ship.

#### 2023-02-16 20:51 - followup: reflection 2

I don't have a very positive opinion of women in general because I've done so many updates to my own form of perception (understanding), and so I see them as all running this really archaic code where they mostly still see that things should be fair, deserved, and just. for things that do not go the way they want them to (or do), there should be a sort of poetic justice or reward for one's behaviour/actions. I've said now countless times now that actions and behaviour don't mean anything -- but instead it's how you feel (ie attitude and perception) which make all of the difference.

one of the nice things about shakespere's tragedies is that he shows how it's not necessarily the (perceived) action itself, but the perception of the perceiver which is being illustrated. in the tragedies (like romeo and juliet), this is the main cause of the tragedy -- thinking that something happened when it really didn't (like cymbeline), and for a comedy, this gets used for laughs like with the frank ford and fallstaff duo, with brook as the reflector.

therefore, because for me I can see that emotion is the determining factor, not the symbols and interactions theirselves (like the difference between rnj vs mwow), I perceive most all of the stupid stuff like you have to put your family above everything else (and other nonsense symbolic interactions), because those symbolic interactions pay no attention to how the person feels (banker and budget), and so what is often times good, can be a real tragedy if the family members are really awful (winter's tale). so -- I simply cannot ever perceive someone who values (and/or tries to affect) specific behaviour preferentially to feeling/attitude/emotion.

I've had endless discussions on this subject of affecting behaviour and it's dramatically affected a lot of relationships, but most notably with mom and remi. so long as those archaic forms of perception hang around, they will continue to manifest into more and more intense ways. I don't feel like I need to prove this anymore, and -- instead for me, it's just another one of those things that I know I'm right about, and because I insist on being so right about it, a fempower justice warriors will say, "why does the man always have to be right?? we females want to be right about it, even if we're still wrong about it." for an exmample in demonstration, look no further than mr. motor and his endless struggle to *still* be right about the things (sometimes unable to admit) he's wrong about.

lawyers, stage magicians, and actors personify this by bending the truth of the situation/character/circumtance to fit their narrative or perception of the thing. this is what all narratives are. they take a seemingly not-understandable set of events, rearrange their order, amplify and attenuate certain peripheral bits to focus the perceiver to an angle that best exemplifies the emotion of the narrative, in action.

#### 2023-02-17 03:59 - followup: fairy tales and the titanic

one really important thing to realise about romances, and for this example, I'll use "lost in translation" -- is that in the saturnian perspective, these things don't ever happen. sure, these sorts of amazing or *unlikely* events can happen to someone who is normally attracting what they don't want (to balance it out) -- but for a person like me who is normally attracting what they want, these sorts of romances can *never* happen. unlikely and desirable events happening is already a normal thing for me, so what some would consider a romance, for me is a normal sequence of events.

you'll notice that the events that compose my "normal" experience are not what most would value as romantic or beautiful (though they are to me), and that's because *the romantic stuff isn't reality*; reality is normal. therefore, if you want something unlikely to happen, it has to become likely first -- but upon becoming likely, it's no longer romantic. you'll notice that I sort of really despise romance, as it's just not realistic. I want boring and real -- not romantic. as such, my goal from day one has been to create a website for normal people (like me) who do normal things and it in some way extends the reach of their consciousness into more than their immediate social experience. this is a task that is effortless (to me), but does require long hours (focus) and work (effort) to make happen.

if I were to hire someone else to make my project, it doesn't get done the way I want it to get done, so like james, I involve myself in every aspect of the project. also, like james, nobody taught me the "right" way to make a website, so I sorta just do things my own way, and as a result, I Love every aspect of the experience. it's tactile and real to me, and while some people may look at the material specifications of the project, the things that I create are ultimately an *emotional experience*. technology (like film) for me is only the medium that I use to immerse my users into the emotional experience. facebook never captured the *emotional* experience of what it was like to use tuenti when spain was still using 56L dialup modems as their primary connection to the internet. it was an exciting experience.

in contrast to this, just as I'm the opposite to jack, bill murray's character is also opposite to me: he's having a mid-life crisis and doesn't know how to direct his emotion into his desire, so he needs a young girl to kind of kick-start and rekindle that flame for him -- which is exactly the opposite to me. right now, I'm expriencing mid-life clarity, not crisis. the *last* thing that I need is a girl to come in and sink my mid-life clarity. in fact, this is precisely what happened in tuenti. if I hadn't have had the experience with the prostitute, I almost certainly would have made a very impactful website.

upon hindsight though, I can say that the failure of tuenti *did* have a very positive effect on me -- though not immediately. the prostitute managed to reprogram a lot of the filters that I had open genetically (cause of my mother's rather open-mindedness), and then suddenly after the prostitute (and others) I changed overnight and started to care about and notice things that previously I was oblivious to, like money or fairness. since that experience, my return back to clarity has been my glory.

I would totally do it again, too. yesterday in a monologue before sleeping, I was explaining that I would prefer to instead of becoming all of these virgin girls reason for attracting and proving their mom's form of perception of men as real (remember most of their mothers are either the reason why or the continuing reason why their father is gay) -- so she's already, on her father's side designed to look for dudes that are like her father (which strongly dislike women like their mother) and I am the most personified manifestation of their father's hatred for those women. I don't really *hate* in the sense of actively pushing against it -- but instead I hate in the sense of having been forced to reevalute a number of my own bogus forms of perception that come from the maternal instinct (feminine-mind).

as a result, instead of putting a bunch of energy into these poor girls manifesting their mom's ultra-archaic perception as true, I would rather to skip all of that and just start over. there is absolutely no hope for trying to get these old hags to try and change their mothering instinct. it simply won't work. for me, that is the titanic that's going to sink. it's not the human race, and it's not the planet, because the planet is a reflection of me (you can not believe that far out idea if you want, but modern scientists will probably agree with me now on this) but it's actually our base filters and perceptions that are going extinct.

what my desire is becoming more and more of now is to take the bottom-up approach. these guys don't want me to do technology, so instead what I think I may end up doing instead is doing like before where I just go with a bunch of prostitutes and then work my way back up to clarity again from there, and just keep rinsing and repeating until I've sufficiently gained enough improvements to my perception that I no longer lose my perception -- and it's sort of hard-wired into my genetics. from there, I'll probably want to then start over completely and build a new female (artificially) from my x-chromosome, and the female as we know it today will cease to exist.

the other option that I've been saying more and more recently is, because as a man, I cannot change the x-chromosome coding, ever. it can only be done as a woman (with more than one X) and then I need to produce female offspring which will carry that forward. I figure the easiest way to do this is to do it the perceptual way (which is what I do best), and so my plan would be to find a way to turn my body into the shape of a black girl, and so therefore my DNA is a reflection of my image/perception (a female), and so then from there, I can make the transformation perceptually.

I just find it extremely *unlikely* that any female would ever have the audacity to stand up to their mother's nurturing instinct (her code, originally from ninhursag/anatau), and decide to do something a different way. I am, as far as I know, the only person with the aduacity to recode genetically installed family values. I do find it notable that jesus was also not fond of his mother telling him to put his family first. therefore, instead of me pointing the finger at all of them and blaming them for constantly being the foil to my great ambitions, instead -- I'll be the foil to their own programming.

something of this is more likely to happen (in my perception) than any of the romantic stuff. after all, if I really am the centre of the universe, well then, that means that *all* things, including females, are a reflection of my perception, and so therefore, I'm not really fixing their programming, but I'm actually recoding my own extremely negative perception of women -- kindof from the inside out.

#### 2023-02-18 17:18 - followup: saturnian gilt trip

as I'm reading this play, "[hero and leander](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.03.0012%3Apart%3D1%3Asubpart%3Dsestyad+1)", it's a bit like a confessional. let me explain: this guy leander really likes hero. it describes him as being very very nice and nearly as if a maid in man's body, which is interesting to note, because I experience the same thing myself, and I believe this is the effect of the turtle/rose, dark goddess anatau, that vile despised beast that she is. I think she's activated with the rose, and came down through the tudor dynasty (through king arthur) -- and basically the idea is that when she overshadows your body, your attraction speed dramatically increases, and it seems to be associated with the left-hand as well. what it is, is she's a SUPER amplifier of your emotion and stuff, so if you have dark, evil, gross or negative thoughts those get amplifed just as much as the other "positive" thoughts.

so what is happening here is that she's the crown -- a chakra that is not inside of your body, and the root/earth is also not in our body. these are completely out of our control just above the root is the sexual organs, which are amplifiers, and also just below the crown is the pineal (also an amplifier). this is why she's described as being completely impossible to control. it's possible (I gather) to control the output of the earth a bit, but the crown is mostly affected by the sun which connects with the pineal and the solar plexus. there's no way to physically control the sun (it's pretty big and unwieldy), so the only thing we can do is to control what is shows up in our imagination (the eie), and also how we feel about it (the solar plexus). betwixt these two extremities is the heart (this is important).

leander is giving her a bunch of arguments why her virginity isn't to be kept, trying to convince her with his words (wit), but this doesn't seem to be working...

    These arguments he us'de, and many more,
    Wherewith she yeelded, that was woon before.
    Heroes lookes yeelded, but her words made warre,
    Women are woon when they begin to jarre.
    Thus having swallow'd Cupids golden hooke,
    The more she striv'd, the deeper was she strooke.
    Yet evilly faining anger, strove she still,
    And would be thought to graunt against her will.
    So having paus'd a while, at last shee said:
    Who taught thee Rhethoricke to deceive a maid?
    Aye me, such words as these should I abhor,
    And yet I like them for the Orator.

his arguments are causing her to feel anger because he's trying to get her to do something she doesn't want to do, even though she admits that she still likes him even though his words (because of his intention) are causing her extreme discomfort. so, leander has to find a new tactic...

    With that Leander stoopt, to have imbrac'd her,
    But from his spreading armes away she cast her,
    And thus bespake him: Gentle youth forbeare
    To touch the sacred garments which I weare.

she's not diging the touching game either, so now he's going to give a bit of a confession about his deviant sexual behaviour.

    My turret stands, and there God knowes I play
    With Venus swannes and sparrowes all the day.
    A dwarfish beldame beares me companie,
    That hops about the chamber where I lie,
    And spends the night (that might be better spent)
    In vaine discourse, and apish merriment.

he really likes her still, and he wants to get his way now (will) so now he's going to begin to compell her by playing with her heart-strings:

    Come thither; As she spake this, her toong tript,
    For unawares “(Come thither)” from her slipt,
    And sodainly her former colour chang'd,
    And here and there her eies through anger rang'd.
    And like a planet, mooving severall wales,
    At one selfe instant, she poore soule assaies,
    Loving, not to love at all, and everie part
    Strove to resist the motions of her hart.

in this moment, all of a sudden her *heart* feels really different, and suddenly she simply cannot resist how her heart feels. she's compelled to tell him to "come thither" -- which is something that has happened to me on a number of occassions. I'm fairly low resistance myself, so when I get around these saturnian types, they tug on my heart-strings a lot. a really good example of this is an [argument that I had with greg](/metal-lucifer.md#2023-01-03-1855---weird-interaction) after listening to "balls to the wall and neptune's eye". in the event, first joe (through seriah) was tugging on my heart-strings, and so when I went upstairs, that (physical 3rd ray) feeling that my heart was feeling compelled greg to say a bunch of things that were not evidentially true at all, but because his heart was being activated by my heart, it caused him to completely invent a whole set of emotional traumas that didn't even happen. the reason is because his heart (physically) felt that way.

fortunately, I know the 4th ray saturnian perspective, not from the 3rd ray perspective, but from the 5th ray (they occult each other, just like in the imagination, one cannot "see" the emotion when you're seeing the physical: 7th occults 5th in the imagination, just like 3rd occults the 5th in the spectral). it's unfortunate here in this poem that hero does not know the difference between how she *really* feels (5th), and how she *physically* feels (3rd), so unfortunately she feels compelled to capitulate to the way her heart feels.

you know, the entire genre of romance is all about the heart and the emotions in the heart -- but here's a good tip for people that are around saturnian types: when you feel something in your heart, don't go up and think about it in your head (reason, logic), because those thoughts will always be a match to the way the heart (physically) feels -- and that's the mechanism that compells her in the first place. sino, instead go down to the gut; feel how it feels in the solar plexus, and if you have kind of a gut feeling of "this is a bad idea", don't do it -- and also, it's worth noting as well that this is the mechanism that caused her to feel anger to what he's saying.

btw, my default emotional response to saturnian heart-string plucking also usually anger and hatred, so don't get down on yourself if you're suddenly feeling unnecessary anger and hatred toward someone. the other common one is depression, giving up, capitulation, and "OK, well whatever".

    And hands so pure, so innocent, nay such,
    As might have made heaven stoope to have a touch,
    Did she uphold to Venus, and againe,
    Vow'd spotlesse chastitie, but all in vaine.
    Cupid beats downe her praiers with his wings,
    Her vowes above the emptie aire he flings:
    All deepe enrag'd, his sinowie bow he bent,
    And shot a shaft that burning from him went,
    Wherewith she strooken, look'd so dolefully,
    As made Love sigh, to see his tirannie.

---

so here's the thing: I just realised the *real* reason why so many of these saturnian types [have such a low opinion of theirselves](/thoughts-from-the-throne.md#2023-02-17-1212---i-associate-chris-with-saturn-as-well): and that's because the words that they use cannot, at times disguise their intentions as *felt* (but not seen) in their imagination (because it's occulted by the 7th ray), and so therefore they have to go a step higher with the heart and manipulate the way others feel that way.

so here's the connection: in the titanic, rose's suitor is one of these saturnian types, and so he's connected to her in her heart. she's the tudor rose, the anatau perception genetics (that I also have), and so when jack starts to woo her, he feels (like marcos with andrea), his heart also going in a direction toward jack and no longer toward him. the speed at which we manifest things causes these *unlikely* situations to happen.

though I haven't read the rest, I know that leander begins to rely on hero's light to find his way to her tower -- but, one night it's too stormy that he can't see it, so he drowns. this is precisely what happened with the titanic -- however, rose's suitor was on a boat with a lot more people so it caused a pretty big tragedy.

this saturnian 4th ray interminging of heart-strings *is*, I belive the reason for the collapse of the atlantian empire and the onset of the YD climate catastrophe. the mechanism is the same: people were projecting images into 3d space and also engaging in psi warfare that, because it affected how people felt, it would turn the tides of battle. marshall arts resulted as a mechanism for blocking/shielding/protecting oneself from other people tugging on my heart-strings, by being able to effectively deflect and return the energy. this capacity I believe was taken to the extreme and became the ultra-reflective "aryan root-race".

#### 5T of pages + fords + fallstaff

### 2023-02-28 12:46 - ganymede and the golden ass

ganymede was a trojan that zeus really loved. notice how this is the contrary to zeus' daughter athena that burst out of his forehead, fully armed, a beacon of wisdom and understanding for the greeks. ganymede is portrayed all over the place as queen hera.

I realised the other day when I woke up that the creation of venus likely happened when ganymede/vulcan/hera had sex with a highly reflective/attractive girl. the way it appeared to me corresponds a bit further with my explanation of "[will and the witch](/the-manifestation.md#2023-02-26-1454---will-and-the-witch)", where if you were to think about the X now instead of from the female's perspective, think about it from bottom's perspective: which is that all of the 5th ray stuff that gets amplified/transformed/diminished continually gets amplified, because bottom starts out as an actor (and I think this follows the story of the golden ass by metamorphosis), and so instead of swapping the X, what happens, is he (the actor) is copying the same sort of just, right, and honourable, big-picture (2nd ray) values of his charactor, and so bottom will (mostly, with a slight twist) resist, amplify, and sometimes transform the same the input signals the same way that the charactor does. obviously this continues to amplify both the good at the bad.

so, when bottom has sex with a reflective girl, it'll create essentially a reflection of all of those things. so, as an example let's consider the case of vulcan (-5+) having sex with helen (-7). this causes jupiter/zeus/ra (+3) to release all of that stored up vibration and passing through the reflection of helen/genxicat, this produces reality: athena (-3) -- the antithesis of zeus. athena causes all kinds of problems because she's pro-greek (white), meanwhile ganymede/hera is notably pro-trojan (red). that's the basic idea there -- and notice as well, that ganymede is also the opposite to zeus as well (-5+ vs +3). notice also the -7 and -3 reflection chamber much like earth's -1 and -7. they form a sort of triad/quad with ganymede (-1, -3, -5+, -7).

---

OK, so now today I'm waking up and I decide to watch some metal. yesterday I watched the first half of "[titus andronicus](https://youtu.be/6ruTPx6YknY)" -- and I noticed a few things. first of all: aaron (opposite to moses) the moor (not white) hides 1000 pieces of gold below the elder/world tree. the 1000 pieces I believe represents 1000 new charactors, which will actually turn into gold (centres).. they appear to me as stars.

the play has a *lot* of notable characters: titus is ares -- who, in the parable of the tub, is the the lover that was hidden in a tub. the smith is ganymede/vulcan and his wife is helen/genxicat. it tells the story of the triad of mars, venus, and vulcan. this encounter of mars (+7) with venus/athena (-3) caused a lot of problems and essentially is what produced the golden ass (cupid). in addition to that triad, there is the relation of saturn and venus (venus is saturn's wife and why the 54 perspective is occulted for saturn, only seeing 34 perspective).

titus (mars) does have a son (lucius) and a daughter (lavinia). they're two aspects to the same person I suspect, as lavinia, represented by lucius and the golden ass (respectively).

anyway, as the story unfolds, aaron (the moor) gives birth to a mixed race baby (like andromeda). demitrius and chiron are grown down to their essence, and lavinia/lucius helps him while titus "plays the cook" (reference to the golden ass) and bakes them into two pies (ie female, cause males only have one pie) which then tamora eats (which seems coincident that she also produces the mixed race baby). saturn then advises titus (mars) to kills his own daughter lavina (the receptive side of cupid), and the masculine side of cupid (lucius) is declared emperor.

however, saturn *does* seem to have a hera-like companion though and that's tamora, who has a (notably homosexual) engagement with tamora as well.

ninlil/sud (ham), the mother of ninurta (mars).

susana and the two elders (jupiter and saturn).

the next thing that I noticed is that saturninus (the roman emperor).

### 2023-03-01 12:31 - two worlds

when I listened to that song, I immediately felt discomfort to this idea: "we *were* close to the wonders still awaiting us" (as if we've somehow missed the opportunity -- which we definitely have not). secondly the line, "we can *only* live in one of two worlds" -- because the thing that I noticed in the planetary gridworker romance saga, I noticed that it's now possible to artificially switch one's world from one to another (they would simultaneously exist all in the same "space"). I also think it'll be possible for people to "graduate" from one world to another. in addition to that, I don't actually see one world being superior to the other two -- because over time they'll all diverge. when things are binary, they tend to make better/worse superior/inferior comparisons because of only one dimension to work with. that setup, not only has infinite expandability, but by nature, you're looking at the three default "worlds" in 3-5 different dimensions (depending how you look).

- I've noticed with a number of metal bands and jason's work is that they have a theme of atlantis (neptune) where that whole thing is founded on the idea, "we're gonna do things a bit differently"
  - according to dtp, the three main factions were necropan (osiris, then later ra), suern (jehova), and poseidi/atlantis (incal, the sun).
- atlantis was different because it didn't rely on any magic or religion to accomplish its harnessing of nature's forces. instead, they took a purely tecnological approach (one that I'm definitely a fan of, obviously).
- what appears to me is that there seems to be desire for a "breakaway civilisation" -- we want to do things differently.
- going back to the xandria song there, the define the new world as the one where they dream, a journey of wonders, jules verne and tomorrowland -- and that's pretty much it (not a very good sales job).
  - instead, the song posits that this is a fragile and lost hope to try and dream so lofty becasuse we're doomed to live in orville's next dystopia.
    - so, probably more of a fallstaff than a sales pitch.
- the idea of having two worlds also showed up when I was [looking at the latest vere/tudor codes](/correspondance.md#2023-02-27-2101---to-him-who-may-think)
  - first of all I liked it because the message is written inside of a banner that says "to him who may think" -- which, I guess nobody *actually* looked up what it meant (or typed it into google translate like me... lol), so this message is for people not just taking the well-accepted translation of a heraldic slogan
  - the next thing that I could see is that there are in fact two worlds -- seemingly on opposite sides of the sun.
  - the other message there is that one of the sides there is identified by A/V/TH so I'll call them the alphas.
  - the other side is a bit different in that it's identified by -- well, I see pi, anyway. these are the omegas
    - the interesting there here is that tau (alphas) represents a whole circle in relation to the radius, meanwhile pi (omegas) is only half a circle relating to the radius. the age old discussion of tau vs pi, I guess.
    - pi reminds me a lot of titus andronicus, where rape and murder are alchemically trasforemed into two pies (ie female), which then tamora eats.
      - tamora is a composite character (because lucius ) I believe where she represents to saturn, what ganymede is like to jupiter (the moon titan), which I think is saturn's "golden ass".
      - when she eats the pie, she produces a mixed race baby -- which is about how far I got yesterday
      - it's also important to note that aaron (as in counterpart to moses) hides 1000 pieces of gold below the elder/world tree so that something good will come out of the evil (forgot the quote).
        - aaron, is a bit of a reversal of roles here because aaron is associated with the golden bull, which bull is what rome should be associated with but in this case rome is being run by saturn, so it's a reference to a time (like present day) when rome is run by saturn. aaron is also black, like saturn.
    - in any case, the symbols are showing the destruction of the roman (red). I agree with the play in that this is likely what the reds are attracting, but the conflict is not necessary.
      - I also call the neo-phonecians the reds, and I think it's also interesting to note that they're the ones most interested in the imperial age, atlantis sort of ideas; another reversal of roles.
- the idea of a "new earth" is certainly not anything new as, the last chapter of the bible is entirely dedicated to it.
  - the text (if I remember )

#### the golden ass

it's also worth mentioning that if one combines the different symbols in the "[the golden ass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Ass)", it's pretty easy to see that the tale of the wife's tub is talking about vulcan's wife having an affair with mars. the problem with that is that in some accounts, vulcan's wife is aphrodite (earth) and in other accounts. at any rate, because of the affair mars sorta combines the abilities of vulcan (-5+) with the abilities of himself (+7) and also aphrodite (-7). so then later when he hooks up with venus (-3) which came out of the heart/forhead of jupiter, this produces cupid -- which, according to the descriptions sounds like pure desire.

it's interesting to note as well the story of cupid and pshche (as in, he's in love with a manifestation of his own mind). she's to be wed to a beast, and looks like there are two indirect references to saturn there: venus was the consort of saturn (and thoth), so the temple of venus may be a reference to that. next she's told to go to the underworld to get some beauty from prosperina/persephone/ereshkigal (the consort of saturn/nergal).

book 11 even tells us that prosperine, diana, ceres, venus are all the "queen of heaven". in order for lucious to get returned back to human form, he has to eat a crown of roses and be initiated into isis' priesthood; isis being the true name of the "queen of heaven".

isis being associated with the sun and the ruler of heaven (ie the symbols in the sky) is significant because "heaven" was always referring to where the "gods" live -- so then one of my theories is that venus is inhabited on the astral plane and that they're the sort of symbolic system where earth and the other (vega?) earth are getting their symbols from. because she's -3, she outputs symbols (3), and saturn (+-4) ensures that they manifest here on earth. remember, 4th ray perception is a combination of 3 and 5 so, he's literally captivated by the physical/sensational part of her symbols, mostly unaware of the conceptual/emotional part of them. she's the link I believe between this earth and the other (vega?) earth.

isis being the queen of heaven is also interesting to me because I've long held that isis is the sun... so, in the idea that I was [looking at the latest vere/tudor codes](/correspondance.md#2023-02-27-2101---to-him-who-may-think), I noticed that the sun was in the middle of the two earths there -- and so if that's the setup, it looks like the sun will have returned back to being the queen (centre) of heaven. in the time when I want to make the galaxy, I see the earth (+-1/7) as being the centre of that -- and that's because I made the progression from planet (more circle) -> star (more dot) -> galaxy (more circle) -- but you know, if we're going back to dot again, that's cool by me. it's an interesting idea to say the least, and I really like the idea of there being a second earth here as well -- especially if can house their desired breakaway civilisation.

#### the other (vega?) earth

this concept was originally put out by terence (mckenna), and I picked it up and ran with it. terence (afri) also seems to be an interesting guy, as it seems that he sorta came out of nowhere wrote a bunch of plays which became the foundation of shakespere and nicomaco plays, and then just sorta disappeared. it makes me wonder if he can consciously move around in time.

anyway, in order for such a concept of another star (-2) to be putting out similar output to our own, there needs to be an interface to work. 2nd ray is a mix of symbol (3) and desire (1). if venus is essentially copying the symbolic perception of our planet (as connected through saturn and the underworld) and then transmitting it out to our sun and vega, the sun will be putting out the same symbolic interpretation of those things -- however, what's missing is the desire/will component. I believe that this planet has a 1st ray star in its centre (-1), and so it's receiving desire and also outputting it, so the sun is taking earth's human desire, mixing it with the symbols of venus, and then outputting them. this is then controlled into a manifestation by saturn in the underworld.

that's probably why cupid has some of those strange tasks. anyway, I think the other world is a great idea, and we should figure out how to get them a new earth :)

#### 2023-03-02 16:43 - john keats

I think I solved the problem of how to get a new earth. drawing on inspiratons from the golden ass, my research into venus, and the real-life experience of john keats, I began [to understand poetic summoning](/poeticc-observvrence.md#2023-03-02-1457---on-poetic-summoning).

### 2023-03-12 14:21 - meaning of 1000

in various places, there is often times associated a number (1000) in conjunction with a tragedy (titus), labour (tempest), or battle (all's well). I've been meaning to write about this for a while now because I, at first, thought this was a reference to solomon and his supposed 1000 wives and concubines -- however, since it's pretty clear that the "ark of the covenant" is related to the rose, right? it got me thinking that the 1000 (points of light) may be relating to something different entirely.

one thing that I've thought a lot about is the growing problem of the x-ray output from (I believe) the star inside of the earth, which is (in my estimation), a reflection of the 7th ray (physical) vibrations of the planet, so therefore a 1st ray, meaning it glisters like actual gold. I don't know how to explain it why I think that but the gold pieces that aaron deposits below the tree represent to me 1000 stars, meaning that they're looking from the centre perspective, the reflection of the actor, so they're like real gold.

well, if by some metric we were to release that star out into space every some period, and again I'm not sure how this connects in my head, but it seems like this is going to be happening with increasing regularity as we go into the future.

I've often thought about what that could possibly be like (from my perspective) if the world lost (isn't the right word) that massive x-ray output; cause, it would feel like a tremendous loss in visceral "real" feeling reality for me. I know it'd probably be quite a relief for others, but for me it would feel like all of life becomes flat again. it'd feel like tremendous loss and like I'm starting over -- sorta like as if this planet is no longer quite as much of a reflection of my perception.

so, if there could be a way to periodically, every time that energy gets too high, release the star out into space and let it start to settle into an orbit reflective of its vibration in relation to the other planets. the way that I see them, they'd be almost completely transparent, having only a slightly reddish hue to them. they'd be floating around in our solar system as semi-strong x-ray emitters, but not quite as strong as they would be inside of the planet.

so then, as I'm reading illiad book 16 just now, again there's a whole lot of homoerotic imagery going on in the interactions between patroclus and achilles. anyway, I haven't put it all together yet, because apparently achilles also has a flashing helmet (something which hector is also described as having), and it means something planetary (or solar), but I haven't figured it out yet, so I still have more to think about there, because the iliad is a book that is personifying planetary bodies like venus as menelaus (and others), mars and fear and strife (phobos and deimos), paris as mercury, helena/aphrodite as earth, zeus as jupiter, hera as ganymede, etc. the whole solar system is in there.

the other strange thing is that one planetary body often times has personifications on both sides of the war, and the constant back and fourth between the two sides seems to be unsettled orbits.

I don't know how the book ends, other than the trojan city falls -- but I'm kinda wondering if the story is actually talking about achilles/hector (and whatever planetary body they represent), journey to its present location. the idea that I'm thinking about is that this could be a story about something like that.

another thing, is I don't actually know if there are other strong x-ray emitters in this solar system. with astral/UV (and higher) vision, these bodies would be visible, and they would show up as the concept that our brain interprets the vibration as (just like some people saw jesus differently than others did) -- a manifestation of individual perception -- a sort of shape-shifter. so when these guys describe dragons and serpents in the sky, that's the image that they're seeing (you'll need to try strong psychedellics to understand what I mean here).

so, what I mean is, the defeat of troy and the trojans may have been simply just letting the star inside of the earth go out into the solar system. this very well could have lead to the "bronze age collapse" -- because think in spherical resonator terms here -- the star in the centre is a reflection of the earth, and that holds all of the rocks and mountains in place where they are, but if that star gets moved out, there's no longer any push-back (internal pressure) keeping everything in it's place, and so lots of unheaval could happen pretty quickly as soon as the star gets "birthed" out into the solar system.

if there were a powerful x-ray emitter floating around in our solar system (but barely or not in visible), that could be interesting, anyway.

### 2023-03-16 22:49 - the new underworld?

as I was sledge's video on [lilith, the first wife of adam](https://youtu.be/n1EKccz4fS0?t=628) and then [he mentions a demon called dever](https://youtu.be/n1EKccz4fS0?t=708)... so I look it up.

    DEVER ("Pestilence") is the other demonic herald who marches with YHWH to battle (Hab. 3:5). Dever is also mentioned in Psalms 91:5–6: "Thou shalt not be afraid for the Terror (Paḥad) by night; Nor for the Arrow (Ḥeẓ) that flieth by day; Nor for the Pestilence (Dever) that walketh in the darkness; Nor for the Destruction (Ketev) that wasteth at noonday."

    The "Arrow" is a familiar symbol in folklore, for disease or sudden pain, and Ketev (Qetev; cf. Deut. 32:24; Isa. 28:2; Hos. 13:14) is in this instance the personification of overpowering noonday heat, known also to Greek and Roman demonology.

notice the arrow, associated with apollo, diana, and the "thunderbolts" that vulcan makes for jupiter. notice also the overpowering of noonday heat. I go to look at Psa 91 in the 1611 version of the bible and all of a sudden that psalm reads completely differently to me now (with these eyes -- because I had just got done writing about [lilith powering the spherical resonator of earth](/sledge-notes.md#2023-03-14-2259---lilith-is-a-star)).

while writing that I was explaining how the original earth (when it was formless and void), it was just a high frequency mist-like substance, but then one of the spherical layers was made more dense, such that the astral realm would be capable of living inside of. then, megalithic structures were built in that layer to fix the layer so that it would remain constant (which today is the function of the giza complex, I believe) -- meaning, that all of the megalithic structures were originally created by building the megalithic structures as sort of like imaginary structures -- and then it was later (after the fall of atlantis) that earth became fully physical.

writing about this idea of taking a lot of the extra energy that the planet is creating, and readjusting the resonance of the planet so that more energy is put into the ionosphere and made constant, so that a new layer was built on top on this earth -- a new astral layer[^1]. the idea would be to make the layer and then go up there and then build out (cause it's made of the same thing as dreams and imagination), all of the megalithic structures necessary to hold it static, get everything all imagined and setup, then put people up there.

the next thing to keep in mind here is that it's my opinion that the [latest manifestation of the YHVH control structure is the antarctic base](/sledge-notes.md#2023-03-16-1112---metatron-and-channeling), and then I compare enoch to cupid in that entry there as well because I notice that the pattern is that this little-YHVH guy seems to sound a fair bit like me. there have been many, and even more than one at a time, so I'm not trying to make it sound like it's just me that does this here, but the basic idea is that this guy somehow finds a way (desire, because he's "good-enough") to somehow surpass the control structrure that's reflective of the time zone that we're in for what we believe a most powerful entity would be like... so for example, the original one for the greeks was zeus, the fickle ridiculous, all-powerful god that can manipulate and get what he wants ... the roman empire ... the american empire ... etc. I interpret this system as saturn and his satyrs that seem to be present in every political and economic arena. saturn and his domain represents the highest that one can go psychically before making the transition into "non-physical" (death).

saturn is the ruler of the underworld (the inner earth) and so therefore his job is to keep the earth's energetic system contained so that we never leave the planet. read "gods of eden" for a pretty descriptive enumeration of the manipulation of our timeline and establishment of control structures (always as a reflection of our perception of "power") by these beings/satyrs. I'm fairly convinced that saturn and YHVH are the same thing -- that is, a vibrational entity that is the lowest common factor of what we expect from an oppressive ruler.

I'm fairly used to this interaction by now, because I'm quite limited on what I can do; if I try and go too fast, I get slowed down, or if I try to program, I get stopped -- or whatever -- because I'm so high energy, I have a lot of "power" so that energy has to be funneled into things that don't give others conditions or technology that would give them an advantage. it's very strange how I can do some things, but not others. it's kind of like working with a computer program, because it's very systematic in its interaction with me -- systematic in the emotional and perceptive sense, as if it knows everything that I'm thinking and feeling.

I'm getting a few reactions now thinking that this system is run, not by saturn, but by a bunch of elites -- and to that I would respond: they don't know how tall the hierarchy goes. everything is fully controlled, and even if they *think* they have free-will, they're not going to be able to do certain things -- as in the timeline gets altered. I present the idea on purpose in contrast to "free-will" on purpose, because it's all attraction: looking from the point of the great attractor at the "end of time" (saturn). there are only so many ways toward that, and all ways that decide to deviate from the attractor, have an impossible time doing so (like trying to escape a black hole). so, (probably thanks to me) we're *all* on an unavoidable course toward the realisation of the "end of time". there's literally nothing anyone can do about it at this point; so, we might as well learn to have some fun with it.

so, when looking at it from our human (will-power) perspective, it looks like a big wall that manipulates things and won't let me certain ways, but from the only-attraction perspective, it's like trying paddle against an ever-increasing current toward the "singularity at the end of time". it's my belief that one of the ways in which we're to "enjoy the journey" involves creating our own reality. the bible and its various prophesies and such, are very high frequency concepts that are translated within the frame of reference of the perceiver of that concept time -- and so, [like lilith](/sledge-notes.md#2023-03-14-2334---lilith-always-looks-like-you-desirefear-her-to-appear), those very high frequency concepts will appear extremely terrible and fearful, and totally not at all what they really are. which, btw, I'm pretty certain that she (the earth herself) the main enitity with all of this attraction coearcing all things to become what she wants them to be (cause she *will* get her way) -- so, we can either conform to what the earth wants, or die -- it's that simple :)

I assure you, nothing is going wrong though, as there's nothing to fear. despite a few foot-draggers out there, I really do think we're going to live out this next solar era in a narrative reality that we create for ourselves. some will pretend that they have power and stuff, but they're playing the game just like everyone else. you can see them however you want to see them -- perception is everything, because your reality is a reflection of it, so you'll always (and forever) exist in the "time zone" where you're fighting (or controlling) your own self (depending on your perspective). think about it like you're interacting with a narrative mirror, and so no matter where you are, you eventually figure out that all things are a reflection of you.

I had been trying to find a way to make such a reality happen with a second earth and stuff (which is almost certainly a future not yet realised), but for now adding another layer (or two) to earth is a pretty engaging idea to me... OK, with that in mind, let's read Psa 91:

    1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high: shall abide vnder the shadow of the Almightie.

secret place = bottommost physical layer upon which the upper layers reside. I become the foundation, so that the layers above it have a solid foundation and aren't a gamble.

shadow of the Almightie = the (1 to 3) new layers above mine upon which all of the top-down control structures will move up to the top-most position there and work their narrative magick.

abide = 1611 says "lodge" (hEro, lol)

    2 I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge, and my fortresse: my God, in him will I trust.

sure, whatever -- sounds pretty secure and safe :)

    3 Surely he shall deliuer thee from the snare of the fouler: from the noi-some [dever].

he'll deliver me from the snare (the matrix?) of the fowler/snarer, which if that's the [king 4d reality](/correspondance.md#2023-02-27-2101---to-him-who-may-think)), the noisome (noisome = foul/fouler) dever, so "from the fouler's dever/matrix"?

    4 Hee shall couer thee with his feathers, and vnder his wings shalt thou trust: his trueth shall bee shield and buckler.

more security... shield sounds like eclipse.

    5 Thou shalt not bee afraid for the terrour by night: for the arrow flieth by day:

not sure what terrour and arrows are... they may just be symbolic to put mars and venus (not sure about this) into the story here?..

    6 for the [dever] walketh in darknes: for the destruction, wasteth at noone-day.

no idea...

    7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand: it shall not come nigh thee.

there's that "thousand" again... it reminds me of bertram and his thousand lovers going to "battle"

    8 Onely with thine eyes shalt thou behold: & see the reward of the wicked.

"reward of the wicked" is a strange wording...

    9 Because thou hast made the Lord, my refuge, the most High, thy habitation:

this one is most confusing to me ... let's say "thou" is kenny and "me" is the psalmist (satyrn?). kenny made the LORD, satyrn's refuge, the most high (of the layers?) kenny's habitation?

    10 There shall no euill befall thee: neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.

more security... safety's my number one concern... lol

    11 For hee shall giue his Angels charge ouer thee: to keepe thee in all thy wayes.

of course... it seems pretty obvious, the angels will always be there to make sure I'm fully controlled, lol. I always find a way to do what I want to do, so it's fine...

    12 They shall beare thee vp in their hands: lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

no idea...

    13 Thou shalt tread vpon the Lion, and adder: the yong Lion and the dragon shalt thou trample vnder feete.

lion and snake are constellations. however, it's notable that ishtar has lions under her feet. dunno what it's meaning though.

    14 Because he hath set his loue vpon me, therefore will I deliuer him: I wil set him on high, because hee hath knowen my Name.

same problem as verse 9 -- I'll assume "he" = kenny, and I/me is the psalmist: kenny set his love upon satyrn, therefore will satyrn deliver kenny. satyrn will set kenny on high, because hee has known my Name (saturn?). I have idea man...

at any rate, if this is the case, I don't know how I feel about this because it's saying that I'll be in the "most high" top-down position, which I'm not super stoked about (and neither are they prolly), so we'll see what ends up happening. it would mean, in the system of 3 layers, this would be the 2nd ray position on top, or, in the system of 3 *more* layers, it means 1st ray on top -- so I just don't know, especially since it seems that the star in the centre of the planet is already 1st, so that would have to be externalised, meaning that then 3rd and 5th layers need to be added.

following [the magical sigil](/correspondance.md#2023-03-14-1642---video-57), one thing I forgot to mention is that 2, 4, and 6 all have (notably) horizontal vibration lines in them (though *kinda* 1, 3, and 4 also), meanwhile 1, 3, 5, and 7 all are notably symbolic. these are obviously the "primary" layers, meanwhile the 2, 4, and 6 are transitional layers. therefore, if we're adding more symbolic layers, then ... I mean, I dunno...

    15 He shall call vpon me, and I will answere him: I with him in trouble, I will deliuer him, and honour him.

kenny shall call upon satyrn? lol, that seems far-fetched. we'll see what ends up happening anyway (note my disagreement with prospero and the duke in measure for measure)

    16 With long life wil I satisfie him: and shew him my saluation.

sounds like achilles, to me. I have no idea what "saluation" is (looks like salutation), and all saviours need a marketing team, anyway... I'm not good at marketing; it happens naturally for me (only-attraction).

---

anyway, I have no idea if adding more layers is a thing or not... just putting this here cause it seemed pretty significant at the time. I had another one reading and doing research on apollyon as well, which I may write next; it's even more ridiculous and far-fetched than this one.

[1]: I just looked up the diameter and I guess this wouldn't make it too much bigger, actually -- only increasing from 7.9k to ~8-8.3k -- so yeah it wouldn't really be all that different anyway.

### 2023-03-18 15:25 - aeneas and cupid

I'm reading "[dido, queen of carthage](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.03.0006%3Aact%3D1)" right now because last night I was researching cupid and I noticed this play has a mention of ten thousand cupids -- which connects with the psa 91 thing about there being ten thousand at thy right hand -- which, I can only take to mean 10000 2nd ray saviour/son types -- which makes sense considering that I figured out the layer problem: if the earth is 7th ray, and the atmosphere/sky is 6th, then the ionosphere above that would be 5th ray -- which makes sense, because there are 4 primary (7,5,3,1) layers and 3 atmospheric/transitional ones (2,4,6) where the two layers mix; the top-most being the 2nd ray.

just like the atmosphere is controlled by the moon here, I figure the other two layers will be controlled by pluto (ie, "the new earth") and chiron (ie the wise tamed/centaur) which corresond to us as two new moons of the earth in the future. this is the book of revelation's insight into the matter (which I've sorta figured out) -- and so the more "solid" layers (the primary ones will be layers that will probably grow out of that). the book of revelation describes the inhabitants of pluto and what that's going to be like, so I don't need to repeat myself there -- but it doesn't (that I know of) talk about the inhabitants of chiron.

I'm inclined, at this point, to believe that the inhabitants of chiron will be all the "narrators" and for a visual description of this, see ben jonson's masque, "[hymenaei](http://hollowaypages.com/jonson1692hymenaei.htm)" and the reason why I think they'll all be narrators and the inhabitants of this moon will be narrated is because the 2nd ray perspective is all about narration: it takes desire (lilith), and symbol (saturn/venus), and then turns them into concepts (juno/hera/vulcan/ganymede) which then cascade down into astral by finding a way of finding a story which can narrate the arrival of those desires(asterisk). therefore, I see this as happening no different.

it looks (so far) like 10000 cupids are going to be doing such a thing. I believe this has something to do with the "[the mithras liturgy](https://archive.org/details/mithrasliturgy0000unse/page/26/mode/2up?view=theater)" (more on that in the future), because the description fits and also I noticed the vowels [have similarity to devere's sigil](/correspondance.md#2023-03-16-1619---mithras-sigil-similarity). I'll explain it better in the future, but in the contract that the magician/initiate agrees to, the sequence is one of previous perceptions: 6-3, 6-7-3 -- which are the trek that the "INFECTED ONES" took, coming from the astral (6), they then put theirselves into the ceremony of magick and ritual of ra/zeus (3). then I believe this happenend again but they had to hit all the way down to physical first (thoth's magical narrative) path 6-7, and then this was enabled the return to symbolic (3) through saturn/diana. some may have taken both paths. finally the last transformation that the mithras liturgy offers is 6-2-4, 1-6-4, 2-6-7-4-2. I interpret the first one as the sort of shakespere-style narrative style. the second as the homeric/epic/desire narration, and the third is one thatI think is a bit of a mix of the first two, but invert the first two: 4-2-6, 7-2-4 and then fuse after reversing them (not sure how it it works, but it looks like both goes backwards and then connects together -- not sure, maybe conjugate or something). anyway...

so I'm reading this queen dido play and I noticed in the opening act, there's an interesting thing to note when venus/aphrodite says to jupiter while he's fondling ganymede:

    I, this is it, you can sit toying there,
    And playing with that female wanton boy,
    Whiles my Aeneas wanders on the Seas,
    And rests a pray to every billowes pride.
    Juno, false Juno in her Chariots pompe,
    Drawne through the heavens by Steedes of Boreas brood,
    Made Hebe to direct her ayrie wheeles
    Into the windie countrie of the clowdes,
    Where finding Aeolus intrencht with stormes,
    And guarded with a *thousand grislie ghosts*,
    She humbly did beseech him for our bane,
    And charg'd him drowne my sonne with all his traine.

I didn't understand why they're grizzly ghosts until I read jupiter's response:

    Content thee Cytherea in thy care,
    Since thy Aeneas wandring fate is firme,
    Whose wearie lims shall shortly make repose,
    In those faire walles I promist him of yore:
    But first in bloud must his good fortune bud,
    Before he be the Lord of Turnus towne,

so, I look up turnus (cause I haven't read aenead). turns out that turnus was promised lavinia first (before aeneas got there), like titus gave lavinia to saturn. in fact, the story of titus andronicus is almost a complete mirror of turnus -- where juno/tamora starts some trouble, but then saves him from death. turnus slays prince pallas (male athena?), taking his belt as a spoil (like achilles' took the lyre from andromache's city), this marks the inevitable downfall of turnus. to prevent the death of turnus, hera/juno conjures a ghost of aneas (like patrocles and achilles). aeneas pursues turnus 10 times, finally killing him in a rage. turnus descends to the underworld (like aeneas did before getting lavinia gifted to him).

so here again are this 10 to 1 ratio of 1000. also, it's worthy to note that troyus and cressida has 1000 hectors as well. that's all I have for now...
