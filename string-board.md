# special k(id)'s string board

### 2022-05-10 21:45 - intro

a few days ago I was asking the question, "why" (see @[blahblog](2022-05-09 14:55)) and I ended the entry with a song called "supermode - tell me why". in addition to that I was listening to snake-bros #027 "pillars of enoch" where they (now russ, you are "they") were talking about the "why" -- well, earlier on in the episode they were discussing sean carroll. I went on to his website and he suggested a book called, "the book of why" dana mackenzie and judea pearl. I read part of the introduction and the book goes wayyyy over my head.

I believe the problem is that they put these formulas down with these symbols which mean things to them, and in their brains, it appears that these symbols are viewed and their entire meaning is understood and then they can then just use the shorthand letter and that letter is just a placeholder for everything that symbol "means". I do not "see" anything in my head, and so therefore I don't actually "see what they mean to say" -- so I have to approach the concept from a different perspective.

the only time I've ever seen something similar to the way their brains operate was with my interactions with the "reality technicians" when eating mushrooms. they would show me a glowing orb (a kind of symbol), and then forevermore I knew that symbol, and from then on that symbol took on many different forms and I saw it in many examples in my life, and so then by life experience these symbols came to life for me and I "knew" them through experience. once I had the knowledge of these symbols I could cause them to interact with other concepts and produce new concepts.

I learned a lot about this type of symbolic interaction with a concept producing a lot of other concepts in my life that would then begin to illumiate this symbol further when I went to spain. especially the women, but the men as well take in data sorta like statistics does (the data becomes enumeration of actions of the symbol which is usually a person or a government entity) and then thes data points when interacting with concepts, "mean something". these symbols become the main characters in stories and are then exaggerated to a point to where they become a "personaje" and that pattern which the personaje performs follows them around and you could say with a very high statistical certainty that personaje is related to those types of actions.

anyway, that isn't what I wanted to say. what I wanted to say is that I want to go back and read the book a little better, cause it calls me. so I'll do something I've always wanted to try, which is take something I don't understand and then turn the feeling/concept it gives me into something tangible (ie. repeat what I understood they wrote, but in my own words).

---

long intro. this blog is inspired by that because we all have these random symbols pass through our lives and they "mean" something to us, but there is no way that these meanings could have any statistical relevance to anything.

we all get fixated on these weird "syncs" that happen (like the why question) all at once, and in my experience, they forever alter my trajectory through life. there's no way they could ever possibly mean anything at the time, but on hindsight, they seem to stand out. I'm going to begin to chronicle them here.

I'm willing to let it all hang out and show people that they're not weird for thinking that "random" occurances which "mean something" get mistaken for "why" :)

by the end of this, you'll see that I'm a very "special" kid that has a problem of seeing everything as symbolically interconnected. it's a real problem that I have, cause I bring a lot of disaster on myself by looking to symbols for the "guidance" rather than trusting my emotions.

also, by the end of this, I hope to illustrate how very different of a perspective it is to have difficulty seeing where "I" begin and end in my experience; is everything just a reflection of my own mentation? why?

### 2022-05-10 22:11 - that mustache feeling

in @[blahblog](2022-05-10 16:52), I made the case that I wanted to let a girl find her connection and then attract me, that way *I would be a reflection of her desire*. when I wrote that, suddenly eva (my neighbour popped into my mind). I noted this down and when I was doing so, I thought also about zaryn's ex in spain as well (don't know her last names). I didn't think much about it, because the idea I had in my head was that it would probably be one of the girls that's using one of my bodies that will find their connection, not so much one of the younger ones, cause how can you find your connection (without conducive conditions), with a barely developed brain. it takes a bit to learn how to use one's perception to feel the way one wants to feel, and so what I was meaning is that one of those girls using my bodies has a *much* better chance at finding their connection with all those good physical conditions around. they have the exact opposite problem that I have and only need a slight capacity to perceive things the way they want to, to get it. it's really easy.

anyway, after that, I turned on "the tick" and it was "s03e01 - that mustache feeling", and in it tick wakes up one morning with a mustache. remember, tick is already a woman in a boy's body, but me has a lot of feminine qualities, like no package, and never any facial hair. this time he has a mustache and so he breaks into a whole song complete with 90's rap about how great his mustache is, and tells the guys at the diner that now he finally he can describe himself as "rugged, self-assured, adult". "it says to the world, I'm a man of action; but action tempered with maturity" arthur is super frustrated and annoyed at tick for his mustache.

---

OK, for me tick is a symbol of me, and arthur is nosebook in general. he represents the constantly worrying brains which have to keep coming up with new ideas to get me and them out of trouble that I get them into. I don't really know who the others really represent[^1], but when it came to the scene with "special angent jim rage", I immediately associated him with mr. motor.

special agent rage is a part of a non-existant portion of the government that lost funding, and he's on a personal mission to get rid of this mustache. he's got 3 vivacius, exciting, talented beauticians, which reminded me a lot of the song, "armand van helden - my my my" which also has three girls in it of the similar colour (black, brown, and white).

anyway, the mustache has fallen in love with a russian beard.

---

at the end of @[blahblog](2022-05-09 14:55), I put in the supermode song and then watched the video a little bit later. I remember seeing the video a long time ago and it's the same as all the other trance videos coming out of germany at the time -- so I didn't notice anything special about it. this time I noticed that there were two dudes. one was red and one is white. the red one drives a white car and the white one drives a red car. I can't quite figure out what happens in the middle of the video, but one of them has trouble with their car and a blond girl in blue jumps into the race and beats the red and white ones.

I noticed the symbolism and pointed out that they're telling a story here and related it to egypt. upper egypt is white (bowling pin hat) and lower egypt is red (champagne bucket), and they were united for a while, red driving white and white driving red. however when akhenaten came into power, the hats changed and suddenly a blue hat that looks like a longhead starts to appear. I believe the egyptian hats are symbols of bloodlines, and there are a lot of flags with red white and blue in them, but the USA is the most symbolic with the red and white on the periphery with blue in the core (you know where the stars are[^2]). in egypt, this blue colour symbolised a female bloodline that descended from the daughters of akhenaten.

anyway, the racing part reminded me of the song "cake - going the distance" -- a song about a guy who is going the distance, going for speed (this is symbolic of me) and all the while he's doing this "she's in her time of need" (so he this distance dude is leaving the girls when they "need" (evolution-of-desire) him the most). OK, so when noticing the two boys lose to the girl in blue, it was obvious to me that this was a sign that it would be a girl that wins the race, not either of the boys.

I noted the flags have those same colours and mistakenly thought that the russian flag had red and white on the bottom and blue on the top. I looked it up and actually that's the flag of a small district in germany I'd never heard of. the only flags that had blue in an elevated or core position is norway (blue cross surrouneded by white and then red on the periphery).

the russian mistake caught my eye because the mustache (which represents to me the girls that are using my bodies) is actually in love with a russian beard. I don't know what that could possibly mean, as it could potentially imply a lot of things.

weird connection there.

anyway, so back to the episode: at the end the mustache drags sewer urchin by the upper lip out to meet with the russian beard and rage is stopped from destroying the mustache by the tick. it's revealed that the department lost its funding so the three girls bail on him. the tick then does a monologue about how love is cool and jim rage had all of the really cool stuff and the three girls, but he wasn't cool. the tick lost the thing that made him cool (the mustache), and he didn't gain a thing.

so the next episode is "the little wooden boy and the belly of *love*" -- where tick has to burn his wooden friend to get them out of the whale.

I had something else I wanted to write but that's enough "why" for now.

---

final thing I noticed: in the "my my my" song, it's full of questions, but they never ask why. they ask "what" as in "where's it going to go" (what's going to happen), and "how" did it get to the state that was never meant ("neuroticfish - mechanic of the sequence" reference)

[1]: I don't associate sewer urchin and deflater-mouse to anyone in particular, but they would probably be my friends, so I see a little bit of chris in sewer urchin, and daniel in deflater-mouse -- though they really could be anyone

[2]: the stars are symbolic to me because I think of girls as stars and boys more as planets, and in my idea where we go along optimising ourselves to maximise energy, I think of the idea of when the sun goes supernova/quasar, the girls concept will get attracted so rapidly to the sun, they would tear through it attracting all of the stuff that resonates with their concept, and they'd emerge on the other side as a tiny star. continuing to attract hydrogen and spew out more dense materials, they'll gain size and higher density planets into orbit with them. the blue ones are the future stars.
