# concept-log

from time to time, I just want to write about a (sometimes new) concept that I experienced.

### 2022-09-03 06:57 - chivalry, possession, and competition

today when meditating, I saw this concept pretty clearly, so I'd like to just write out what I saw.

when it comes to obtaining a woman, it's said that "everyone has a price", and that price is related to effort. the more effort I put into it, the greater the price I've had to pay (chivalry) and so now, I can consider that I own you -- or, that you're now my possession.

this showed itself as related to competition because ... I can't remember now. ugh... fail.

---

I remembwer now. when I think about competing with someone over something, that competition must involve effort, however, if no effort is needed to obtain the reward, then it no longer looks like a competition.

it was obvious to me that the reason why chivalry exists is because competition exists.

---

so, what would society be like if competition didn't exist? well, it'd be about attraction rather than competition. if I want something, I want to find a way to attract that thing, rather than having to pay a price for it.

the commerce aspect of needing to pay a (higher) price for something that is better is an app that comes preinstalled in most of our devices/instinct (it's a default thinking pattern).

therefore, most of us believe that the more something costs, the better it probably is. I say probably because we do have the idea of overpriced, so the product needs to invest a bit in marketing to promote itself as being worth the cost.

this is your basic sales and chivalry explanation.

so, again, I'm going to retorically ask myself, "what if society didn't have competition?" -- or rather, I should say, what if I didn't compete with anyone? well, it would look like acquisition of things no longer involved paying a price for them.

if other people have better things than me, that's good for them. I don't need to prove myself with the possession of a thing or a person. just imagine for a moment that everyone else had better things than you do (that's probably pretty easy), but then now imagine that this doesn't bother you. in fact, you could even be glad or happy for them getting what they want. that would be more similar to how a non-competitive persen might think.
