# concept-log

from time to time, I just want to write about a (sometimes new) concept that I experienced.

### 2022-09-03 06:57 - chivalry, possession, and competition

today when meditating, I saw this concept pretty clearly, so I'd like to just write out what I saw.

when it comes to obtaining a woman, it's said that "everyone has a price", and that price is related to effort. the more effort I put into it, the greater the price I've had to pay (chivalry) and so now, I can consider that I own you -- or, that you're now my possession.

this showed itself as related to competition because ... I can't remember now. ugh... fail.

---

I remembwer now. when I think about competing with someone over something, that competition must involve effort, however, if no effort is needed to obtain the reward, then it no longer looks like a competition.

it was obvious to me that the reason why chivalry exists is because competition exists.

---

so, what would society be like if competition didn't exist? well, it'd be about attraction rather than competition. if I want something, I want to find a way to attract that thing, rather than having to pay a price for it.

the commerce aspect of needing to pay a (higher) price for something that is better is an app that comes preinstalled in most of our devices/instinct (it's a default thinking pattern).

therefore, most of us believe that the more something costs, the better it probably is. I say probably because we do have the idea of overpriced, so the product needs to invest a bit in marketing to promote itself as being worth the cost.

this is your basic sales and chivalry explanation.

so, again, I'm going to retorically ask myself, "what if society didn't have competition?" -- or rather, I should say, what if I didn't compete with anyone? well, it would look like acquisition of things no longer involved paying a price for them.

if other people have better things than me, that's good for them. I don't need to prove myself with the possession of a thing or a person. just imagine for a moment that everyone else had better things than you do (that's probably pretty easy), but then now imagine that this doesn't bother you. in fact, you could even be glad or happy for them getting what they want. that would be more similar to how a non-competitive persen might think.

### 2022-09-05 08:04 - the absence/opposite of what you desire is the message

yesterday when writing out my thoughts on steiner's [manu and initiates](/steiner/atlantis-and-lemuria.md#initiates-and-the-manu), I made of off-hand comment in reference to the saviour that your will produce the saviour or it'll produce more situations that you need to be saved from (depending if you're looking at the presence or absence of the desire). I then followed it up with a comment talking about how this comment reminded me a lot of mcluhan's "the medium is the message".

I've thought about it since, and I think a better rendering of the idea would be "the absence/opposite of what you desire is the message" -- and by that, I mean, if you want a saviour, that means you have a lot of situations that you need to be saved from. if you desire money, you don't have enough. if you desire (whatever), it means you don't have it.

---

thinking on it further, I believe this concept is likely the origin of buddhist teaching. so, for exaple, I don't really desire a whole lot of physical things -- in fact, almost nothing that I desire can be acquired with money. the things that I'm most interested in, is what I'm doing now, which is understanding the (non-visual) conceptual nature of reality that we all share and interchange concepts in.

various people have called this conceptual world the aether, the world of ideas and other such things, but I distinguish it from the astral because it's not visible. I describe these ideas in visual terms, because I believe it's the same part of the brain that processes imagination.

as you may know, I don't see pictures in my imagination, so like a blind person that does not see, all of their non-visuasl senses are enhanced -- so the same is with me.

I claim that this conceptual world is the precursor to desire and that what you feel and the concepts that you believe to be real, do manifest themselves into reality. one only has to look at the few times that I leave the house and notice that the concepts that I have been contemplating manifest theirselves into reality relatively quickly.

so, what I'm trying to say is that I could try and go the buddhist (or tesla) path of removing all desire from my system, because unless one has conceptual capability to believe the presence of those concepts in reality, they're only attracting the absence (or opposite) to be manifested further. so far as you continue to see the absence, you can never see its presence, and *that* is what causes suffering.

therefore, this subject of desire revolves around the subject of the imaginary or astral, which *looks* like the presence, and so your brain perceives it as such, even though underneith it, you really *feel* it's absence.

although vision boards and other such visualisation devices are popular to try and manifest the envisioned thing, I don't really recommend them because you can only manifest what you're capable of visualising. what about all of the other conceptual stuff? how do you visualise yourself understanding how the nature of electricity works or understanding how the universe works? you can't. these are non-visual concepts that are only acquired through reception of those ideas.

I purposefully didn't use the example of saying, how do you visualise yourself as having a certain feeling. I've been doing this stephan schwartz meditation on and off for a few weeks now, and I'm telling you it's definitely a different set of skills to feel yourself as one of the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual concepts. sometimes, feeling those ways causes a vibrationally similar image to pop into my mind, but that isn't the feeling. the whole process is learning how to feel the feeling itself, so that you can exude that feeling when you go out into the world.

to give a more concrete example, imagine I wanted to visualise love for myself. I could visualise having sex with someone, but that's not the feeling. that's a visual symbol of that feeling, and until that exact situation manifests, I hold myself away from feeling like that now. so, for material crap, visualisation probably works fine, but if your desire is emotional or conceptual, I *don't* recommend visualising it so much, else you'll keep attracting its absence.

the absence of the desire *is* the message.
