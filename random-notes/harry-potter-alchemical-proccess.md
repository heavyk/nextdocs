### harry potter and the alchemical process

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhKit86AzkQ)

I started out writing notes, but I'm going to turn this into an entry here. it'll be my most polished one yet, as it's taking me a while to write it. it started out wondering why it felt to me like her explanation of harry felt backwards to me, and then upon investigation, it seems that things cannot be taken at purely face-value. there is a deeper meaning here and these are some of the ideas that have resulted.

#### alchemical symbol notes

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical_symbol

harry - half-blood (salt - body)
hg - no-blood (mercury - spirit)
ron - full-blood (sulfur/fire - soul)

mercury and sulfur together is cinnabar (HgS) and is the most common source of mercury

sulfer is NOT a planetary metal, and represents fire which is one of the elements

mercury is a metal, but it's also the spirit and represents the aquatic state

salt is the chemical arrangement where one side of the molecule is positively charged and the other side is negatively charged (hermaphrodite), containing both genders

you have to read between the lines. salt is the real "osiris" (transition between both -- the sky between earth and space), the sort of binding force between the metal (hg) and the non-metal (ron).

this shows that harry can go between both worlds -- the world of the magical (ron's) and the world of the mundane (hg's).

---

it looks to me like there is the ideas as presented, and then there is a bit of a switcharoo. I see harry as the sky, not the earth, while hg is clearly the earth. actually, they seem to alternate states endlessly, constantly swapping roles.

it seems to me that this is not a static picture. it's a moving process. there look to be three states and two parts interacting in each(?).

#### salts and duality

salts, appear always to be in motion. they seem to be constantly swapping states because of their inherent imbalance. they represent chaos. they need two stable elements on either side to maintain neutrality (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate#/media/File:Sulfate-resonance-2D.png)

the most basic salt would be hydrogen. I visualise them as rubber bands. hydrogen has an electron on one side and a proton on the other. they are constantly swapping sides. a bigger version this would be a salt like NaCl. one side is Na+ and the other side is Cl- -- these two continually swap back and fourth like the hydrogen does, just a bigger version of it.

#### the basic triad/trio

the most common triad is isis, osiris, and horus. the fourth (hidden) element here is set (which likely represents the environment), but the basic structure is that one is positively charged, one is negatively charged. between these two warring elements is the salt. osiris is the salt (earth), isis is the spirit (mercury), and horus is the soul (sulfur) or the creation. I think that's why horus is the son or the creation of isis and osiris.

#### fear of death and the alchemical process

the bad-guy is voldemort -- the idea that the bad-guy in this alchemical process is actually the fear of death, vol-de-mort or fliht-from-death. this is strange because the alchemical process where the salt is lightened from a reddish hue into a white/light colour, each time leaving behind a black crust (there are those egypt/nazi flag colours again). as one loses the fear of death, one is released from the bonds of that crap that is left behind each iteration of the alchemical process, leading to the "winged solar disk" (golden snitch) -- having the radiance of the sun and the capacity to fly.

this interestingly is the same way that I see planets "evolution" as happening. this is when the planet goes from a dense "metallic" (in the astrophysical sense) state to one of a gaseous state. it gains mass by becoming more attractive, while transmuting its higher density elements into lower density elements like hydrogen and helium.

a pure "perfect" result (like the sun) is never possible, and so a planet starts out in a dense state and through the alchemical process tends toward a less dense state. while a star starts out in a perfect state highly attractive state, but then with the magnetic interaction of the planets around her, she starts to produce more and more dense elements from those interactions (solar flares, etc) and spews them out into her environment which can, which become resources for the planets to ultimately utilise, and the elemental composition of the planet (including its conscious bits like plants, animals, and hominid species), eventually cause the planet to begin to rotate faster and faster. it has to become more attractive (increase its magnetic field) and transmit its higher density bits into something less dense.

so, seen from this standpoint, there is a star (hg/isis/ishtar/sun) and she is the "perfect" one without any need for magic (the purified end result). there is the salt (harry/osiris/enkidu/earth) and he is transition between the star and also another planet (ron/horus/gilgamesh/mars).

as the planet begins to get more moons (like electons), this these are outside masculine influences, much like the p-orbit planets are to the sun, these moons/electons begin to create charge imbalance and weighs the planet down, causing it to slow its spin. the planet needs to find a way to increase its attractiveness (magnetic field) and also transmute a lot of its higher density elements into lower density ones.

there's an interesting duality here where high density elements theirselves contain a high amount of this "spirit" inside of them, but the alchemical process is transmuting the external gold into internal gold by transmuting these external heavy elements into lighter ones while at the same time increasing one's attractiveness. it must happen simultaneously, otherwise it ends in stagnation or vapourisation/explosion.

#### the alchemical process as a genetic algorithm

mercury and sulfur work on the salt to create the alchemical process. mercury represents the spirit and sulfur represents the consuming/destructive force.

the thing is that I had always considered the sulfur to be the creation, not the destructive force. however, when looking at this in the context of a genetic algorithm, the sulfur is the destructive force and mercury is the creative force.

that is the obvious state, but as with all genetic algorithm, there needs to be a feedback mechanism (propagation), and a method of quantifying the result (fitness), so I think this is the obvious interpretation of the alchemical process.

however, mercury is a metal (though it's liquid) and so therefore is very dense. fire, however is a plasma and so therefore is not dense at all. this may be why ron is considered the full-blood magician. he's the desired outcome, but also he's the catalyst.

however the creation is clearly the salt/earth, which is the reborn diety that returns to life after each iteration -- I would also contest that there is another creation, which is the fire.

in a genetic algorithm, the thing that you create is only as good as the destructive force. like, if there weren't many viruses, we would have very fragile bodies. the fire is what creates the resiliance by invigorating motivating the crap (seen as black residue) to the surface. the better that negative force is, the more resiliant/pure the creation.

therefore, each iteration, not only is one collecting the most creative elements (even in thme midst of so much conflict), but one should also collect the most destructive elements as well. these destructive elements are then going to be given greater implements to further try and invigorate more crap.
