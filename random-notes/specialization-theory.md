### 2022-04-05 21:37 - initial thoughts on evolution and hybridisation

I listened to the snake-bros episodes on "stabilization theory", and have been very interested in it. I feel like writing about it.

the first thing I noticed is that he begins the whole thing with an anti-definition of the word "species" -- essentially saying that the word species is some sort of artificial barrier in reproduction in organisms. the religious idea is that things reproduce after their own kind and that mixing kinds is a sort of abomination. he makes the etimological connection between "hybrid" and "hubris" saying they stem from the same root of being "against nature"

the part that really caught my attention was the bit on plato's take on species. for some really strange reason I can't remember anything that he or plato said now, so I'll paraphrase both.

plato was saying that there is a physical world (this is the world of 2's) and there is an idea world (the world of 3's), and that each physical body (which divide/double) has has a idea or conceptual counterpart to it. the ideal conception is always perfect and out of it there are multitudes of imperfect representations of that ideal.

I believe then that somehow this got taken to mean that a species is the ideal and there are multitudes of very similar with only slight differences (like eye colour, stature, stripes, etc.) and within that ideal (species) they are all reproductively compatible. so the original idea for a species was that there is some sort of ideal that all of these physical variations extend out of.

because that idea is sorta fuzzy because no one can actually look at and identify that idea, scientists have gone to great lengths to try and separate different organisms into groups, and put them into species boxes. again, this doesn't work out so well because of hybridisation, but it became dogma because "origin of species" was well received in the 18-1900's when empires when globalism was just beginning and empires were wishing to establish their dominance -- so, a message that the strongest, most fit, and well endowed empires, like the "species" would ultimately win the evolution game.

this world view worked well in a time before the internet because whomever had the most money or strongest military could exert the most influence, meanwhile a peasant had virtually none. I think that strong surviving bit got changed to be the most fit, and that too, I believe was reflective of the mentality of the time. nowadays, it's the most fit survive, which I think russ pointed out, is like saying, "the best survivors, survive" -- lol. nowadays, success doesn't have anything to do with any of those factors at all. in fact, a noob could "win the lottery" by minining bitcoin, and money isn't all that hard to comeby anymore with a rudimentary knowledge of technology and some creativity. maybe money isn't the metric of success.

so, then maybe what we should say is the "most successful at propagation" -- and then this now calls into question sales and marketing. if I can get lots of users to follow me on instagram, that's really good, but is that success? do instagram followers produce vigourous genes?

the next thing that caught my attention was one of the questions about the cambrian explosion, the tales of these very very inviable hybrid crosses mentioned all over the place in the mythologies, and the thing about the thing that the liger is bigger than both a lion or a tiger, but a tigon is smaller than both the tiger.

last night, I drew the connection between the "giants in the land of milk and honey" and the many other stories of some sort of environmental condition that causes people, livestock, fruits and vegetables to all grow much larger than usual. I think it's likely something to do with stone boxes, giving the same effect as "box-consciousness", and they were essentially pumping up the number of protons (H+ ions) in the atmosphere and the mtDNA is putting all of this extra energy to good use creating larger than normal organisms. either the lion or the tiger has superior mtDNA to the other, which is what makes one grow more rapidly.

so that explains the size difference. I also think it's quite possible that during events like the cambrian explosion, close approach of comets and other things like earthquakes (things that ionise the air), can produce conditions which make reproduction more viable, because of the extra resonant proton energy in the air.

in times past, I think it quite possible that stone boxes, pyramids and the like were used to create this energy in their "fertility rituals" -- and so by creating this energy, very distant hybrids were not only more likely, but frequently successful.

they would be dependent on that energy in the air for their continued propagation and so if a catastrophe reduced that energy, morphology would change (like the beaver and other megafauna reducing its size) and also many hybrid species would become much less fertile because of the change in environment.

this is consequently the same theory that I have for the "y-chromosome bottleneck" mentioned by antonio zamora of ~24-18kya.
