this time three of the bowling pins with balls on top symbols are seen with the uraeus on both sides and rams horns on bottom. the person on the left, they went out of their way to scratch out his face, yet the figure just to the right with the same triple crown (horns and uraeus) was not scratched out. both of the symbols on top of the staff are rubbed out though.

I think this has to do with the rams horns that sobek and khnum are seen having. since this was happening nearer to the age of aries (which would have the age during rameses). the cow horns with the sun disk may have something to do with the previous age of taurus.

this time, it looks like isis is on the left (presumably this is isis because she looks nothing like the other depictions of hathor here in her temple) however, it looks like isis is wearing the hathor horns and disk symbol. she's shown supporting a resurrected osiris. he has his upper egypt crown with the feathers, but now his crown has rams horns too.

finally, on this carving that talks about the end of the egyptian empire, there is another figure with three of the bowling pins with balls on top, flanked by two uraeus and three solar disks, plus the horns on the bottom.

there is definitely a symbolism to these things. starting with the solar disk flanked by uraeus, the upper and lower egypt crowns, the vertical feathers, the hooked feathers, etc. it appears to be showing qualities of the rulership or something else symbolic. the coptics were very specific to rub out some faces but not others. these symbols have to be denoting factions or probably bloodlines.
