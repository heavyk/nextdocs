I corrected and expanded on a number of these ideas in @[newblog](2021-11-04 16:18).

37:36 - the number 36 is probably 666, the number of the beast. it's a well-known triangle number: 1+2+3+...+36=666. the numwer of his *name* is 666 (36) (see rev 13:17,18)

sion, the seed shall inherit it.

there are some strange things qualities that this leviathan has...

1. fearlessness.
2. king of the prideful children
3. beholds high things

42:40 - the part about the maiden phoenix and the heir. there's another verse in the chapter, job 41:16, "One is so neere to another, that no ayre can come betweene them."

job 41:1-4, YHVH is asking job/vere if he can draw out the dragon (to be captured), and then once vere has done so, then will vere make a covenant with the dragon, or will he make the dragon his servant for ever (a servant for e-vere)...

in verse 5 he says, "Wilt thou play with him as with a birde? wilt thou binde him for thy maydens?" -- which is a really weird thing for YHVH to ask of job... will he play with the dragon like you play with a bird or capture him for his maidens... why would job consider capturing the dragon for his maidens? maybe it has something to do with the seed.

then, he asks job/vere if he will make a banquet of him, or split him to pieces and sell him to merchants.

the weird thing about all of this is that all of this is it is connected to the the two witnesses, which are is the symbol for the builders of the temple of solomon, but also of the hero/gemini twins (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-rFsDDlmf8)

rev 11-13 are interesting chapters because the two witnesses (which I think are the twice 11 brethren), say great blasphemies about YHVH but the weird thing is they have all of the powers that YHVH asks job if he has...

5 And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and deuoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, hee must in this maner be killed.

6 These haue power to shut heauen, that it raine not in the dayes of their prophesie: and haue power ouer waters to turne them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.

7 And when they shall haue finished their testimonie, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomlesse pit, shall make warre against them, and shall ouercome them, and kill them.

just as the lazarus of bethany was 4 days in the grave bhen jesus resurrected him (john 11) these two were 3.5 days in the grave. it looks to me like vere makes a very clear distinction between lazarus the body (he) and lazarus the spirit (hee). this falls into line with the hero twins myth where the mortal one sacrificies and the other one has to come back to save him. one is the spirit and one is the body, but they are the same. this may be one meaning to sonnet 36.

so, going with the hero twins idea, it looks to me like

anyway, a day is 1000 years, so jesus when jesus was resurrecting lazarus (hee), he's bringing back a 4000kya idea that got put into the grave. well, these two are resurrecting an idea from 3500 years prior. this was roughly the time of abraham and moses, hence the sodom and egypt reference. somomon's temple was about 3kya but I still think it applies here.




of course none of this is talking about a literal dragon. it's talking about some with the capability to create fire. this is the prometheus figure of old tales, the serpent of the garden.

likely this has to do with a bloodlines thing. I think the seed needs to come from the bloodline of moses(?) or david or something like that. I don't really know. it may be referring to the dragon bloodline.

what I do know is that alan green has shown that elizabeth is referred to as diana, the "queen of heaven" aka innana, ishtar, venus, or the whore of babylon.

the dragon tries to prevent the whore of babylon from giving birth to the future "king" of the earth (symbolic of the job/vere in that chapter), which is the man who will rule the earth with an iron rod. the future king (which vere thinks he will eventually be) has to be the progeny of the queen of heaven to be the rightful heir.
