jupiter (osiris?)
saturn (isis?)

so nut can have children, thoth makes a bet with the moon to see if it will rival that of ra ... the moon rises in brightness and 5 days are added to the year (ie. earth spins faster), and that allows nut to have 5 children. this is probably the time of the birth of planet venus.
