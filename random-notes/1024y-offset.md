# a saturian conspiracy

it's the large hadron collider. naw seriously, I got the idea that 1000y are missing from silvie (new earth lady), and I think she's right about "I611" getting turned into "1611" thereby giving us 1000 extra years. upon looking into it a little more, I noticed that the sun seems to work on powers of 2, so 1000y may actually be 1024 -- and so then, I postulated that there is an inflection point on the time line. 12 years before 2000 is 1984, and 12y after is 2012. I also noticed that tesla is born (12*12)y before the inflection point of 1984. that prompted me to begin looking at the idea that things happen in segments of powers of 2:

- 2112 (+128y)
- 2012 (1856 + 14*12y)
- 2000 ()
- 1984 (zero-point midpoint reflection)
- 1856 (-128y)

### 2022-04-06 03:20 - GMT and time offsets

listening to snake-bros ep "#065 - skirptards gonna skirpderp" and russ mentioned that the speed of light used to correspond to the kings chamber in the great pyramid in longitude coords.

longitude is the vertical offset of the earth in degrees, while the meter is originally 1/1000000 of the distance from the north pole to the south pole.

there are 299792458 units of that measurement. 29.9792(degrees) of the circle is the vertical location of the great pyramid, which sounds pretty good, but the earth rotates E->W, not N->S, so it seemed strange to me that is the vertical component is referenced to the speed of light. kyle mentions that the prime meridian used to be a physical location on earth -- the king's chamber but they moved the prime meridian to greenwich in 1884. I was very surprised at that date because in a previous entry, I presented the idea that 1984 was the inflection point in a series of time modifications that set us back 1024y into the past, making it either 1022 or 998 (not sure which one), rather than 2022. I did some calculations and I'm fairly convinved of it. I may go through them in a more organised fashion but here's the reference: @[newblog](2022-03-21 23:54).

as in that other entry, I do some quick calculations and notice that tesla would have been 27/28 in that year. the year that I was 27/28 was 2011 in berlin when all of that crazy stuff happened[^1] (met patricia, found the sirian guide, etc.)

I believe it's important that the prime meridian is no longer associated with a fixed point on earth because I read [a long paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00190-015-0844-y) on why the prime meridian has moved 334m since its establishment in 1884 and it turns out there has been a "gravity anomaly" because the mercury well they used to establish the vertical component of the telescope was influenced by "gravity" when they established that line and so therefore the mercury did not show true vertical angle, but a slightly off one.

at the time, all telescopes on the planet in the GMT registry used this mercury system for determining the vertical component, and so all telescopes were off by some amount (in some cases very large amounts) from their angle difference to a reference star.

thing is, mercury can be influenced by a lot more than just gravity, and supposedly it's capable of anti-gravity, but let's just stick to magnetic influences being the reason for the anomalies. they have a large table that shows that the measurements over time have varierd by very large amounts (one is 12", 0.0033(degrees), or 370m), meaning that either gravity is not stable or that magnetic fields are having a tremendous influence on the mercury.

so, they decide to move to a few new systems and it turns out that they have some flaws, but ultimately the new system (that exists today) is a geodedic one no longer in reference to anything fixed on the surface or a star and is based on at least a few stacks of assumptions and this is where we get UTC/UT0/UT1.

UTC was originally standardised as an average of the pole (eg. precession), then followed by later improvements to the systems which now "automatically adjust" for a number of different things. these very dramatic changes that automatically need to be adjusted for seem to imply that precession or the angle of the pole is also varying quite a bit too.

the whole setup can be read about in the paper, but I thought that it funny that the irony of the whole system is that since then SI has determined that the metre will not be a fraction of the distance the light travels in a second.

just thought that was a funny coincidence that the meter was a fraction of the polar circumfrence of the earth, which put the king's chamber at light speed (measured in metres/10000) degrees N latitude. then on the hori

when doing [calculations in a spreadsheet](/data/orbits.ods) -- which reminds me to add in the rest of the solar system objects -- it seems to me that there are times that harmonics can be reached when we would cross the octave line and so therefore we could move backwards in time and it would be nearly imperceptible to us on earth.

it'd be too difficult to sort it all out, as the times in the past would be too difficult to figure out, but it appears that the great pyramid is actually a time anchoring device holding light speed to the desired speed.

I wish I could figure it out better, and one day I will, I'm sure, but the way I figure it, time was probably adjusted a long time ago either slowing things down or speeding them up (not sure), and then catastrophic events were inserted to then slow things down.

so, like imagine that time is measured in light speed -- and so a long time ago, you use something like the pyramid complex or some other energetic structures to speed up time considerably.. like say double the speed so the earth has a 730d year, and then simply skip days, so that monday is a full day, but then tuesday is the third day, wednesday the 5th, etc, and all astronomical calculations appear correct because the earth is traversing the same distance around the sun, even though it has double the rotation speed.

this works well for probably up until about 300y ago or so, when things need to go normal speed again allowing science can establish itself as it has done in the last 300y. however, because human progress will naturally speed up the speed of light and the rotation of the earth, systems need to be put into place which make all of these calculations relative to the earth rather than to space and then smaller and smaller slices to be used. not so sure about that process yet, as I don't see it well enough yet.

the other way that I can see it is, imagine speeding time up (I'll use octaves) at l6 and then map it to 64, then at 17 and at 65, tank the timeline and have a catastrophe and limit progress so that it's slow going all the way until 32 and 128 when things are going fast again and can be mapped, then again at 65 and 129 add in another catastrophe and limit progress.

in fact no catastrophes need to be asserted into the timeline, as they will happen as a natural result of going really fast (eg. fast reality creation) and a few misaligned perceptions. so, to build the catastrophes, terrible ideas need to be inserted into the cultures to ensure that they're already expecting disaster and then just let them do the attracting of their own disaster.

well, eventually -- like my supposition in leapfrogging-time-pickles -- I/we can't be exploited anymore, and so at that time, the progress is really rapid, but no disasters are attracted. so, like the leapfrogging-time-pickles idea, each harmonic (which in this example are the 2^n octaves, though it could be fifths, etc.). each time the timelines cross, that's when a timeline is created is iterated on. I suspect the process would be to insert as much difficulty as possible into that duration of time and then iterate on it until I no longer am exploitable. this will cause the beginning part to go slow, but the ending part to go really fast -- much faster overall than a steady exponential increase. the time that's "saved" in each timeline adds up to become a bigger and bigger number until the amount desired to be saved is done, then -- probably just go back and make sure power structures are in place where the rulers make the rulers, set the clocks, and keep all of their temporal adjustments for their own benefit.

as an example, to figure out the julieta and augustin thing for encanto, I was looking to find out why those months were named after emperors, and the timekeeping was all so incredibly convolutud, almost certainly no one can make any sense of what day it really is.

so imagine the akhet heiroglyph as a curve and set the creation of the great pyramid at the top left and we'll make that t0. the y-axis is the "speed of light" relative to the earth. throughout the entire curve the speed of light will be appear to be "constant", but that's only an illusion because the constant speed of light is encoded into the structure, and because you can't argue with measurements of large stone structures cause they're sorta "set in stone" -- but the thing is, the speed of light is only near enough to that speed for the lower part of the akhet curve there.

so, at some time in the past, it was probably a little faster than it is now, and then it went a little slower than now and then started to speed up again here recently. it'll eventually go much faster than it is now, but by the time that has happened, nosebook and the whole world will be compromised in the sense that we'll all use a system of time that is relative to everything else.

---

the last element I want to introduce to these ideas is the concept of "time slicing" -- and that's one that is kind of hard to explain, but a few times, every now and again, there is a flaw in the system and I experience time at full speed. everything gets very very smooth and it feels like I experience the "full" experience. however, that's only rarely. what normally happens is I probably only see or experience a very tiny fraction of my experience. let's say that we divide each second of my experience into 1024 segments yet I only experience say only 32 of them (ie 32fps) -- and, because of the same phenomena that makes persistence of vision possible, to me it appears somewhat like a mostly fluid experience. the rest of the time, something else is happening in my body which is not my experience.

what I imagine is happening is that other people's experiences are put into my body -- sorta like how others on the network have my experience -- but I don't see it, and it wouldn't make sense to me anyway because it would be the composite of all of their experiences added together -- like if you take 100 images and add make all of the pixels signed numbers and then multiplex them by adding them together -- well, as long as my dynamic range is more than (100*127), everything is fine. it's also quite possible that all of the experiences are encrypted with symmetric keys, and/or a normalisation "key" to ensure no clipping happens. then, they're recording all my senses, so for 30 of the frames, I experience my own experience, but the other 1000-30 frames get demultiplexed, decrypted, and distributed to the proper recipients. in this case I have 1/33 of my experience and the other 32/33 of my experience is used for other things.

if my frequency is really high, that's a ton of available resources for others to use. I used 1000 cause it's a nice round number, but I imagine my frequency is rising with each vision upgrade, meaning that I'm ever increasing my bandwidth. in this example, there are 940 frames available for other uses. so let's say they sell 100fps experiences to others, that means I still have 840 frames available. if I get a bunch of vision upgrades and say my frequency rises to be 1200, then now they still have 1040fps to work with. this is basic "time slicing" and it's what windows does to give you multitasking.

I notice this time slicing phenomena happen to me a lot when for example in a movie, they will have some text on the screen for maybe  500ms, but because I have a much reduced fps, I only see that text for 15 frames, which simply isn't enough for me to read it. I have no idea why it's so hard for me to read text rapidly, but it's really difficult. my guess is that imagine I encoded text into a movie that is playing at 60fps, and it was static for 59 frames, but every second text would appear for one frame. you could definitely read the text because of persistence of vision but it would be much harder than usual.

as such that's my experience, but let's just say that this technique will be used for people in the future to compensate for the increasing speed of time and light (I doubt it's happening now). imagine that the earth spin speed remains the fixed 365.2425d/y it's at now, but actually instead of that, the earth is really spinning 100 times that speed, but you only experience 1/100th of it...

... I'm trying to figure out how it would work and I can't seem to figure it out. I know that it has something to do with sleep. I wake up all the time feeling like weeks have passed, but everything appears to be somewhat in the right place. like it seems like it's the right time of year and stuff -- and also I know that if I decide to stay awake for periods longer than 24h, mr. motor has a total breakdown.

they pull my consciousness from time to time when getting so desperate, so I think one day I'll try and see what happens if I stay up for 48h or something and do some astrnomical measurements to see if seemingly 2days have passed in the night sky even though I only experienced one. I'll probably need to wait until I can see venus again and track which stars are next to her -- probably taking pictures because I can't seem to remember very well. I'll also need to figure out how to stay awake for 48h reliably without losing consciousness.
