### 2022-04-22 21:35 - a new thinking on planetary gods

yesterday I listened to snake-bros #049 where kyle expresses his initial thoughtsa and enthusiasm on velikovski's "worlds in collision". it has been a while since I read it and quite honstly I was essentially brain-dead then compared to now. when I heard the thoughts on venus and mars again, I saw it with "these eyes" and jumped right into it.

the sirian-guide talks about venus and mars once being lovers... I outlined this a little bit in [triads](/sirian-guide/triads.md), but not very well. the thing that stuck out to me:

> *Allayandra* was left free to be the Protector of the Purpose. He often went with Jeortau, Ra and Tahuti on their "diplomatic excursions". Just how diplomatic these tours were was the subject of many group jokes and produced a notoriety for them throughout the Universe. Being a SEVENTH RAY warrior, he also worked with *Anatau*. Within her energy domain, he could wield her energy as if he were a FIRST RAY male. *Allayandra* loved *Venus*; these stories are still around in the form of Mars and *Venus*.

it's talking about mars loving venus, but the only female mentioned is anatau. I looked up venus and it defines venus as "unessa" in atlantis. they go out of their way to say that she had a vehicle like ra's (crystaline)

> Ra arrived here in a vehicle that was fairly human looking except that it was transparent. He has a silicon based body which accounts for his glowing like a crystal.

this reminded me of something russ made a point of -- that if venus is the core of jupiter, then it'll be filled with CHON and likely the core of jupiter is very compressed carbon (ie diamond). I know that diamond is carbon and silicon based is more like quartz, so I don't know how to deal with that yet, but I thought it was interesting that ra and "venus" have the same glowing body.

so then let's look at the triad for venus:

> The THIRD RAY triad we have given you as Venus, Tahuti and Saturn. The name of Venus in Atlantis was Unessa. She was precise organization. The affairs of the THIRD RAY department worked like silk with her interjection of energy. Her personality was calm and peaceful and she radiated security. She arrived on earth in a vehicle like Ra's, consequently she too glowed. Unessa was exquisite of form and grace as you would expect a THIRD RAY to be. She personified divine intellect smoothly working amongst form.

she's also a 3rd ray (like ra and ptah), but female. she worked with thoth and saturn.

later on in that episode, they go on to talk about this one legend that's found in 19th dynasty tombs (most notably ramses 2) called the legend of the heavanly cow (I think. I might be mixing some things up). in the legend, thoth makes a bet with someone to increase the brightness of the moon (the moon is illuminated by the sun) and after some wagering finally wins the bet, making 5 more days (ie. the earth is rotating faster), and this nut and geb (earth and sky gods) to "reborn" the original 4 into 5 kids: osiris, isis, set, nephthys, horus.

I believe all of those existed previoushly *except* for horus. he's the new one. horus looks like a hawk and was reconstructed by isis out of the parts of osiris. allayandra is of bird of prey type, and thoth is of the loving bird type.

quick sidebar here: I've been reading oahspe and there are two thoths: there is thoth the original god of wisdom and understanding then there is thothma that believes he is the reincarnation of thoth and constructs the great pyramid according to the plan of osiris. likewise there is also an original osiris and then the false osiris (the one building the pyramid).

it's kind of difficult for me to get it all in order but osiris (the fallen) separates himself into two after man eats from the tree of (the knowledge of) good and evil, and I believe this manifests into two parts: ra and anubis. so osiris is the etheric (conceptual) god and the one running the show and then manifests two atmospheric (astral) parts that take on physical form (ra and aubis).

---

OK, so in oahspe, osiris makes a bunch of people officers to do his bidding (25/23.3-6), and I noticed that some of the names there directly corresponded to some of the triads. I then tried to work my way backwards to the triads. those passages mention 9 (3 triads) entities, and sirian-guide mentions 12 (4 triads). I can kinda fit them all in, but there is a major problem with jeortau, ra, and sanatau for placement. the problem is that the oahspe (false) osiris calls himself the christ or the saviour. the sirian guide defines this as 2nd ray, and so therefore would either be jeortau, a reflection of osiris, or opposite polarity isis. the other problem is that osiris "falls" and goes against jehovih and he does this by commanding a bunch of angels. in this way, he's much more 3rd ray (ie. ra or sanatau). oahspe defines "ra" as earth, evil made flesh, physical embodiment of evil (10/13.10 11/1.68). it's really hard to pinpoint which one is which.

to further complicate this problem, the story of the heavanly cow talks about how sekhmet (anatau) destroys mankind, and so that ra (in this case sanatau) comes up with a plan to paint the rivers red as if it were blood, and so she would be enticed to drink the blood but it was really beer and she got intoxicated from it (! reminds me of enkidu, actually). here again is water turning to blood, blood rain, etc. so alomst certainly anatau is the lioness which then after ra's tricks she becomes the "heavenly cow" (hathor).

you'll notice this hathor, ishtar, astarte, ashteroth figure keeps showing up... so now, I decide to have a look at geb and nut's 5 children. it occurs to me that there are two girls (isis and nephthys) and 3 boys (osiris, set, horus). horus is the new one, so that has to be venus. I eventually come to the conclusios that isis has to be saturn or jupiter, but I can't say for sure. set is probably mercury which leaves osiris, which is most likely saturn... right?

I woke up this afternoon and I was thinking about it: there are 2 gas giants that are visible and there are 3 visible inner planets. so, then it must be then that the female form of planets is more like a methane gas hydrate (mgh) to use ackerman's definition for jupiter or the p-orbit planets for tychos modelists out there. making then the masculine version of planets to be the rigid rocky (silicate) inner planets.

- set (mercury)
- horus (venus)
- geb (earth)
- osiris (mars)
- isis (jupiter)
- nephthys (saturn)
- nut (uranus?)

---

OK, so now I have to get this back to the venus story. I can't quite see it well, so I'm just going to talk it through. I don't want to get into ackerman's theory that mercury is the core of mars (likely ejected by venus), but in that episode russ gives the example of billiard balls, saying that a planet smacks into jupiter and like a billiard ball, this ejects the core, but the core of the planet that bumped into it would stay inside of jupiter.

velikovski made a prediction that jupiter would have a much lighter core than would be otherwise expected, and that is indeed what happened. jupiter, though containing 99% of the planetary mass of the solar system (excluding the sun), has an extremely light core. so, let's just say that the planet that impacted jupiter was tiamat, zyron, etc. and the asteroid belt and the trojans are what's left of the outer core.

another thing to note is that horus was considered the "saviour of the world" (like oahspe osiris). horus also has a few positions in the sky, the most notable being: horus-risen (horizon). he is a reborn-deity too in that he travels through the underworld and then rises again. though, he's considered a solar deity, I would say he's connected with the sun only appearing on the horizon (ie. venus or mercury).

there's another strange thing is that all newly risen (born) babies in egypt were to have the dove (peace, jeortau) or the falcon/hawk (war, allayandra).

there's another strange thing that set is referred to as "iron" and lodestone is "bone of horus/osiris" -- so then set (iron) would be attrcted to osiris (mars) (and the bone part means "core")...

crap, so maybe I am considering ackerman's theory here... let's keep going...

a tomb (I believe perhaps the same one with the heavanly cow story) shows horus with a "was secptre" pointed at the face of a pharaoh. ie. horus = (has the power of) set + osiris + ra.

---

so here's where I get speculative: if I combine velikovski and ackerman's theories together, I would say that venus was ejected probably 4-6kya and was eventually cautured by the sun. assume the tychos model of the solar system now (cause it's impossible to do it with the heliocentric, but pretty easy with the tychos model) and all moses would have to do is to purturb venus' orbit so that it started to behave more like a comet (perhaps if venus' orbit were enlarged, this could produce the 52y jubilee), and eventually colliding mars, ejecting mercury, which was the end of the 18th dynasty, and the beginning of the 19th dynasty where these stories are found in the tombs. this was the beginning of the iron age and is what could have also caused the bronze age collapse.

ok, enough speculation...

---

if a planet did smash into jupiter and that is what created venus and causing the asteroid belt, that would have had to have happened some time ago, it couldn't be as recent as 2.5-3.5kya, so let's say that was the ancient destruction of tiamat (not the more recent "exodus").

so here's the deal: the sirian-guide references allayandra and anatau in the same sentence that it says that mars loved venus. this must be referring to the planets. let's try two situations:

if tiamat is original anatau, then she goes into...

imagine for a moment that jupiter is original anatau and then tiamat smashes into her and ejects her as venus. let's say for a moment that tiamat is jeortau, sanatau, or vulcan.

I say jeortau because he is said to have had a "sacrificial role" but being the "christ" he aligns more with horus than with venus. horus is also considered the saviour and has the power of ra, osiris, and set.

I say sanatau because he's a 3rd ray and later unessa/venus is a -3 and so a core might show a polarity change... like, imagine if rocky planets are more like geodes in that all of their gaseous stuff (like jupiter) was on the inside rather than the outside, and that condensed hydrogen becomes a realities reflective of the vibration of the perceiver (ie. inner earth stories) -- meanwhile a female has a hydrogen outer and rigid core.

the other possibility is that vulcan is tiamat, and that's why he has a polarity change -- because his core goes into the planet jupiter, and jupiter's core becomes the planet venus.

---

going more on the core and the layers of the planet, I just noticed something: the other planet they identify is saturn and he's defined as +-4. so, this starts me thinking that the polarity and order that they give things must be the layers of the *planet* (the pure energy from which the planet is formed).

so, let's say for a moment that "-" = hydrogen/helium reality and "+" = heavier elements, and then then the number is the frequency/perception of that planet. so when it says +3 for ra, that would be a very high frequency illuminated planet, or when it says -3 for venus, that would be a very high frequency emitter (white light nearly). for mars (+7) he's illuminated in red, but around a -1 (probably UV or xray source), he can emit in UV/xray.

---

here's another idea: we have 8 major planets and a sun (or tiamat, depending on how to count) making 12 (ie. the four triads). consider for a moment that they say that the original triad had to be pulled away some 52kya. let's just imagine for a moment that those are sirius a, b, and c they're so high energy that they're far from us now. that means that we should be able to find the planetary bodies in the others.

one other weird thing I noticed is that I could find all of false osiris' minions in the triads, except for the 2nd ray triad -- and the weird thing is that osiris and isis is in the 2nd ray triad (anubis is canine, like osiris is said to have been, but false osiris behaves more like 3rd ray commanding demons and designing pyramids), but they're very opposite. in fact, the sirian 2nd ray triad is also nearly opposite to the 1st ray triad.

#### first ray triad

- (-1) anatau (Ashtaroth, the Goddess who never tires, fete the circle and the true cross)
- (+2) jeortau (Baal, wise and powerful the Sign of the Sacred Bird, Iboi)
- (+-3-+) sanatau (False Osiris) / lucifer commands a bunch of fallen angels

#### second ray triad

- (-2) isis
- (+3) ra (personification of evil)
- (+-6-+) osiris

#### third ray triad

- (-3) unessa (Ura‑na, a quill and staff)
- (+7) thoth (Hermes, most unflinching of generals, the Inqua (solar symbol))
- (+-4) saturn (Posee‑ya‑don shall have dominion over sea‑faring men in all these divisions of the world)

#### 7th ray triad

- (-7) genxicat (Apollo‑ya a bow and arrow (lust, mix breeding))
- (+7) allayandra (Pluton‑ya a torch and brand of fire, rule over mortals for the destruction of cities and houses)
- (-5+) vulcan (Hefa‑yis‑tie a forge and tongs)

---

you'll notice a few major things there:
1. that vulcan is forging *iron*. remember set is iron and mars is red because of iron oxide. vulcan is also opposite polarity
2. allayandra is warrior and was smooth-talking and desirable.
3. I originally thought genxicat matched "apollo" in description for lust and being desired, but then I realised just now that for opposites, she would be more like war and destruction. however, it never says the gender of either pluto or apollo. both of them fit both.
4. I mentioned above that jeortau and sanatau are opposites of each other just like genxicat and allayandra.

I think that the difficulty to accurately define one over the other, where the legends show the mixing of the two males in the triads rather than the pure *is the point*.

you'll also notice that these two captains of osiris apollo and pluto are the opposite ends of the solar system: pluto and sun (neither of which are planets), and they embody the two ends of the physical spectrum of the extremes of ishtar (1st ray female) from a 7th ray perspective: lust, rape, physical desire to reproduce (creation) -- and then opposite: war, fire, ruling over mortals (destruction). you'll notice that this is the top of ashteroth/ishtar and baal seen from the opposite ends. baal is a mix of sanatau's wisdom and jeortau's sacred bird (the ibis) and allayandra is the opposite: a bird of war (like horus/ra) and represents a mix of anatau/ashtaroth in war, destruction and lust (genxicat).

it's hard to describe the concept in my head, but if you have two triads at right angles (a like an astrology square), then you two more triads are formed with the opposites. two triads is a square and this is the serpent biting its own tail. I just tried it out though and I can't figure out what I'm "seeing" in my head...

mix jeortau + sanatau (anatau is mixer)
mix allayandra + genxicat (vulcan is mixer)

something like that, but I don't know how to describe how it becomes a square. looking at it more analytically, it appears now more like a hexagon/cube (8 points, just like osiris' captains, but if you look at it at root-3, it's 6 points, two triads, probably with the 2 females at either end of root-3). that's cool.

OK, enough of that... I super need a break
