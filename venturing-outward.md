# venturing-outward (deturtling effect)

### 2023-04-04 01:45 - going to madrid

today zaryn asked me if I wanted to go to madrid -- well, he didn't really ask, making sound more like an imperative choice that I need to make (lol). mom did this to me all the time when I was a kid, giving me the choice -- but I better choose the one that she wants :)

I have quite a few ideas on it, and to be quite frank about it, I don't necessarily feel *that* much resistance to it at this point -- as I *do* want to go to madrid at some point -- so it's just a question of when. I gave mom some ideas today when I talked to her (of which some I'll repeat), but obviously because I can't talk 100% plainly, I withheld a lot of information. here I can and will be unrestricted; which is the first thing that I don't want to give up. I really like how I am here, and would really like to see an amount of open conversation and plain talking before I venture too far out of my shell.

to explain what I mean, you have to understand that I really enjoy the freedom that I have here writing whatever I please. if I go out, I lose that freedom, and that's kind of not an improvement to my situation in any way. I suppose that I'll be able to still write and stuff, but I find it'll happen a lot less frequently, if at all. imagine for a moment how hard it is for me to get any alone time at all when I'm in madrid, how hard it'll be for me to, whenever I get an idea, just to go outside, sit in the sun a moment and then, after it's ruminated a bit, to go downstairs and write it; that's not going to happen in madrid, I can assure you.

looking at this now from the contrary position (as if I'm in madrid), now I can see that I've become a reflection of the people there, and so even when brainstorming I'll just be translating feelings and desires *of other people* into words and ideas. I do that already a lot here (where do you think all of my ideas come from? they come as a reaction to the general thought feelings that I have around me). when I'm here I get a pretty good signal; the shower better, but honestly when I'm in madrid, I won't really be getting either.

the power with which I feel the thouhts and ideas of those around me is actually my *number two concern* when it comes to anything girl-related, as well -- as I really like my own thoughts and ideas much more than I like other people's ideas, no matter how pretty the people or the ideas are. in the end, my ideas are the ones I like the most. I enjoy cultivating my ideas, as they're the ones that I like (pretty obvious, because I thought of them). the other major problem with this is that I'm a *highly* reflective person at this point, and so I will reflect any feeling anyone projects toward me back (usually) in a less resistant way -- which is really good, but it's going to be very intense (for all of us), as the feeling (for example) of just going to a bar and hanging out will be something like being in the middle of a futbal game or something (so much energy -- it'll cause certainly noticeable effects, as I will greatly amplify everyone in the area). again, not a bad thing, just I don't really feel like I'm all that stable, which brings me nicely to my next point.

that inttensity that I have right now will likely be considerably less (in some ways) after I have sex, because I'm sorta very similar to a virgin in the way that they're quite good amplifers. after that (again like a virgin), my energy will be considerably more tangible and not so etheric. what that means is my energy will feel a lot more like pleasure and a lot less like pure euphoria. the difference in that energy is something to consider because before then, my ideas will be much more "high flying" like they are now, where I see the pure concept, uninhibited and unrestricted. after that, my imagination will be much more activated with the energy of whatever my partner is more often able to notice in their imagination. again, I *really* like my own form of perception -- and so that makes this subject my *number one concern* when it comes to girls; I really *don't* want to see her how she sees herself -- and I really *don't* want to see my ideas through her perception either.

howvver, when I was talking to zaryn I was trying to find a stabilising force, and I suggested that perhaps ice man can join us so that I have some stability, but I'm strongly reconsidering that idea. the other idea that came into my head, was I was thinking maybe if I can get bea (from the canary islands) to come up, as I feel like she (or some other woman that I have some kind of relation with) would offer a lot more stability -- but then again, her presence will obviously change the tone of a lot of the conversations as well. though I haven't seen bea in over 14 years or so, the way that I feel her is what inclined me to make this comment (yes, I can feel people at a distance, even though I've not seen them in a while -- it's like I'm connected to you all in a lot of ways). I tried to find the feeling for patricia as the other option but I couldn't really find her feeling so well, as it feels to me like she's behind a shroud, something like the other high paying customers are, as well -- so I can't really comment on that -- and the inability to have that kind of feeling/telepathic communication with her negates the whole effort for support in the first place.

support, as you know, is a sort of feedback or relativity to something else; and, in general, I don't really have any sort of "support" in my life at all. I live in a world where everything is kept a secret from me and all things are to remain that way. it's obvious: if I don't have any relativity to anything else, I can be moved around in time pretty easily. from my perspective, it's a bit bizzare to see how much things change from morning to morning, btw. almost certainly you all don't really notice much of any change at all, but for me each new day is a dramatically different experience. if nosebook were to have to move around, not just me, but the entire group of us, I have no idea what the effects would be (and I doubt they do either). like, we'd probably all have to be sleeping at the same time so that we move around as a group -- and I don't know how comfortable you all are going to be with noseboys moving things around all the time while you sleep -- as I've sorta gotten used to it... (though, I might add thatt their manipulation of physical and temporal conditions is likely increasing all over the world, and so it's not too unlikely that we're all going to be moved around with increasing regularity -- welcome to my world, I guess...)

therfore, because I don't have any real support, and can never really have too much until I'm sexually involved with some others, I prefer to just keep at it on my own. I'm pretty good at how I do things, and I'd like to keep it that way for as long as possible.

---

I've been thinking about what's likely the subject of said encounter in madrid, and as best as I can tell, it's probably got something to do with some of my many ideas; or, at least that's what I *hope it's about*. I say that because on the way home today I was sitting by the river thinking about how I should probably go to madrid to self-sabotage. I'm pretty dissatisfied with my present circumstances, as this whole thing of having to keep everything a secret is really annoying.

to explain what I mean -- for example, just typing that sentence above about my dissatisfaction about having to interact with other people that want to keep me in the dark about everything resulted in a semi-strong feeling of negative emotion form one or more other people; imagine for a moment that I'm brainstorming on something and I need to bring up a concept that involves nosebook (because that's where almost all of my ideas come from) yet, for example I don't have data/statistics on what that idea is about so I say I don't have stats on the present predicament of some market or whatever, and now we have a conflict because I'll be able to "see" you all looking up whatever it is in your heads, and so I'll get a sense telepatically from you all what it is -- and so I'll say what you looked up, or call you out on it that you know and -- that will create more negative emotion which will escalate pretty quickly, probably into (at least) my left-side shaking violently as I can feel the rage in the room (ref: conversation with melissa & remi). obviously, this dramatically limits our ability to talk about anything implementation-related.

therefore, if we can't talk about anything implementation related, then I don't need to come to madrid; instead, you all need to learn how to communicate more effectively with me at a distance.

finally, I'd like to mention that the way I'm leaning now feels to me a lot like I want to just sorta keep it real here and stuff, as I just feel much more comfortable witth my progress now as it is. to explain in more detail: today is fire kenny's birthday, turning 23 -- and then I have 54 days, which neatly divides into three periods of 18 days where I've noticed that I go through dramatic changes mentally, and probably also physically as well. tim (nance) has started doing elizabeth barrett browning's poems in april (one per day), so he's 4 ahead -- but guess what: there are 54 of them... crazy, right? I've also discovered "pilgrim of tinker creek" which is a book that I really want to read. I also would really like to finish up henry 4 (part one and two), and a number of others...

speaking of which, tim left [a clue in one of his shorts](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UAgJ_BPEmeY) about a future event I haven't got to in henry-4-2, where in it prince hal (who will become king) has to give up his relationship with falstaffe so that he can start to enter into his new leadership position. OK, let's just assume that this has some relevance in my life, and I'm harry/hotspurre here and zaryn and the madrid life is falstaffe: well, the events that happened in henry-4-1 haven't even happened yet, so going to falstaffe isn't even time yet (as they'd be *after* the war, not before) and I think glendower has to be born as well (though I'm not sure). however, I don't take narrative *too seriously...*, as I find it much easier to kind of just follow what I feel -- and like I said, I feel pretty dissatisfied witth my present situation and dissatisfaction will become greater dissatisfaction in the event that something manifests and therefore amplifies things.

in addition to that, the narrative bit is somewhat important to a lot of other people, as what I've learned is that I'm not the only one that's interested in understanding what I know -- and so as long as there's desire for me to keep writing and talking about this stuff (illustration of my ideas through narrative), then I'm happy doing this. I don't really find it of any need to try and rush anything out.

furthermore, you have to also understand the concept of *time resonances* -- which is, for example: the real actual histories of edward de vere, francis bacon, ben jonson, and christopher marlowe (among others) are having resonances on the present timeline we're experiencing now, *and* depeding on how we perceive the same fluctuations in our present will greatly determine if the ups and downs (in relation between the symbols) will yield wanted or unwanted. in addition to those time resonances having an effect on the present, so too will my timeline have a dramatic effect on future resonances, as well. for evidence of this, just look at the effect that the various johns, jonsons, roberts, edwards, and francises have had on history -- and almost certainly the majority of those are fueled from the collective works of their plays and sonnets.

it's pretty clear to me that the focus that we put into the "play" (or, if you want to call it a simulation or game, is fine too) is having dramatic effects on what quality of characters are summoned to interact with us. basially, I'm pretty sure that (from my perspective), zaryn was summoned by me, simply because I had a desire to make a social network -- and so, because I get my way, it happened -- and because a lot of art and theatre has put out various ideas of what those things should conform to, I conform to those symbols and then to my perception of them. for an example of this, look no further than rene decarte; he was clearly summoned by shakespere, and conforms to the symbols attributed to bertram (and other more subtle symbols). inotherwords, we're all creating the future we're going to be doomed to repeat.

from my perspective, I'm basically a raft floating on a giant ocean. I have no control over the ocean (and perhaps you all neither), and my only job is to keep finding a way to stay facing upwards on top of by feeling the way I want to feel about whatever is happening around me. because I'm so good at it, we can go full insanity mode if you guys want to be reliving the dramatic experience (doesn't matter to me, as I'm obviously pretty good at this). so, sure I'll tell zaryn tomorrow I'll fly to madrid on the next airplane and we'll just see how it goes... I'm gonna have a lot of fun, lol...
