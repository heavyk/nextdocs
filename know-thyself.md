# know-thyself

[OK, I'm just going to start writing here and edit it later. I don't know what I even want to title it yet, but the inspiration comes from a number of different things. I'm going to start over and write it all again, so much of it could be duplicate information -- TODO: DELETE THIS]

this document attempts to put into writing the process whereby I understood myself. I did it mostly by studying women and how they interact. as a result, I've found that this way of looking at things pretty well describes the receptive side, so it can be used to understand receptive people in general.

spectrally speaking, like a carbon atom, a perfect receptor is a perfect emitter -- and vice versa. to be ignorant of one is to misunderstand the other. most people may be surprised to find out that they have a receptive side, thinking they only need to emit what they want to get it, but I assure you, it's often the case that the thing you're looking for is right in front of your face -- and it's actually your own reception that's preventing you from seeing it.

the receptive side, IMO, is far more important than the emissive side because it takes a lot more precision to receive what you want than it does to transmit what you want. precise tuning is a skill that's something like being an audio technician knowing what you want to hear. the sound is out there, but *how* are you going to hear it?

I'll present this data in the female form because I learned it mostly from them. it's also going to be presented as my own experience, so take what resonates with you.

### feedback loops

*we have capacity for all ray types, but it's common to have one more dominant than the others.* so, whatever your dominant ray type is, males tend to more often to be emitters, meaning that they neglect or even avoid their receptive side. males receive their opposite ray type and emit their ray type while females tend to emit and receive their ray type. grounds are less common and they're capable of both emission and reception. my theory is that is mentality influenced by the sex organs (TODO: more on this later), so if you have an atypical arrangement there, you may get different results (this is something I don't have data on and would be very interesting to get more statistics on in the future to improve my understanding).

for males, it seems less common to get a runaway feedback loop by yourself (though it is possible because it's happened to me). however a good example of a runaway feedback loop can happen because of LOA. he emits anger and hatred (5), let's say, and so that attracts more angering physical circumstances (7), and so because he's receptive to those concepts which aggrivate the situation further. so unless those physical circumstances is an inanimate object (or something like getting lost or inability to find something) -- usually for emitters, these feedback loops mostly happen with others (usually good at "pushing your buttons"). also I've noticed that when it does happen to males, it happens when he's in a receptive mode of thinking (discovery, invention, interest, programming, etc).

for grounds, this happens all the time, but usually with interactions with the opposite ray type (so like a 3rd ray and 5th ray or 1st and 7th). opposite ray types compliment eachother, but only when one is receptive to the other. it's very invigourating for me to see the symbolic synopsis of emotion/concept that I feel -- or to look at the reality of a thing instead of the desire (we call this manifestation). however, if you want something and someone else is showing you a reality that you *don't* want, that 1-7 combo can be very very annoying (or to have your complex and detailed emotional situation summed up into a symbolic interaction like, "so you're upset that he doesn't value you").

for females, because most of them are emitting the same energy they're receiving this is the most perfect storm for a runaway feedback loop (just put the mic in front of the speaker and see what happens). so, you can imagine it can be much easier for them to get into runaway feedback situations all the time.

whether you're causing this runaway feedback loop by interacting with someone of opposite ray type as you or all by yourself, the results are pretty similar.

#### importance of the ground in the triad

in the traditional triad of two males and one female -- the female is the powerhouse of the triad. she's the amplifier. typically the emitter is usually uninteresting, ignoring or even neglecting his receptive side (he's usually off kinda doing his own thing), so the ground is the stability for the group, but most importantly for the female. without her, it's pretty easy for her to get off into one of these feedback loops.

#### still a work in progress

as I've been writing this, I've noticed that the runaway feedback loop has two possible directions it could go. it's the same feedback loop but one is perceived in the opposite direction. if this is true, I have yet to discover new feedback loops I hadn't previously thought about; I'm going to figure them out here as I go. so 7 feedback loops according to ray types and two directions for each is my goal.


#### 1st ray

1st ray females tend to be very intense. they experience desire, creation, and destruction all very similarly (at least that's how it is for me). they're very chaotic in that they get an idea of something they want, and it *has* to happen now -- the sooner, the better.

the foundation of creativity is desire, and so when an idea comes, the reality of that idea comes right along with it. this reality is at the opposite end of the spectrum (7), and so it has to traverse all of that distance to get to down into the physical. as a result, anything that feels like it's in the way of that becoming a reality must be removed. this often times results in the destruction of things. she's usually not intentional about it, as most of the time it never make it up into a full-blown thought, but something got destroyed -- that's why I associate desire with chaos and random.

on the opposite end of that spectrum, if she wants to create something, that reality of what she wants to create is so invigourating, that she'll spend long hours fixated intently trying to get the whole thing done in one go. any success or accomplishment creates that feedback loop where she just has to have more. desire is the root of "addiction", and so you may think of this creativity as her source of that good-feeling she's "addicted" to. it's won't feel like an addiction for her though. it already feels like a reality, so she's compelled (acting without thinking) to make that a reality.

on the opposite end of the spectrum, from the perspective of desire, destruction is pretty much the same thing as creativity because the reality of what I want to create is more real to her than the thing standing in the way of that creation.

desire is a very subtle feeling, so often times when something breaks or gets destroyed, we oftentimes feel bad, because the loss of the thing is felt more strongly than the desire for the new thing. so you can imagine that a person that is capable of perceiving the potential reality as real (kids are like this), can get into a runaway feedback loop of destructive behaviour; she'll clear one thing out to make way for the new, and the presence of that new thing (desire) is felt in such a strong way, why limit herself to just making way for one new thing -- why not more? so she destroys more.

#### 2nd ray

a 2nd ray sees the big picture of something. the 2nd ray sits between desire and structure (which is desire mentalised into parts). that means she's aware of the parts, but what she's most conscious of if how all of those parts fit together and work together. she sees all of the things working together in just a certain way. this is her "the right way" from a relational perspective. this usually conflicts with the 3rd ray who also has "the right way" to do things, but the 3rd ray is usually concerned on the individual performance and/or function of the parts, rather than their cooperation with the other parts.

her mind's eye is the opposite to the 6th ray's imagination/perspective -- which usually is just seeing a single part just assuming that part fits into the big picture.

she'll see everything as working together smoothely in her mind's eye, so often times she'll get to trying to become someone else's source -- trying to create their reality for them, because she sees "the right way" where everything works out orderly and properly.

[TODO: I don't see the opposite feedback loop here. that's OK beause 2nd and 4th ray is still difficult for me to see. I understand the 6th ray perspective even though I don't see it, so after that, it may illuminate the opposite loop. revisit.]

#### 3rd ray

the 3rd ray is about segmentation and

#### 7th ray

a 7th ray fixates on data and

### active intelligence conflicts

I'm using the phrase "active intelligence" as a way to say, "what you understand". a 3rd ray understands the 4th ray and the 5th ray, but they are from the opposite perspective (and vise versa for a 5th ray).

this creates conflicts, especially in the transition layers (2, 4, 6) because they usually only see one half of the situation. for example a 6th ray has the active intelligence of a 5th ray, and so for them they "see" the physical as an image in their mind (so it looks ideal or of paranoia), but they're not quite fully "grounded" in the physical reality of things. they can conflict with a 7th ray on being too ideal (or paranoid) or they can conflict with a 5th ray because the 5th ray sees the abstract idea purely and doesn't need to turn it into an image. for the 5th ray, it just is -- an abstract idea. it dosn't have much physicality yet and doesn't need to, until it needs to be put into the right part or segment (3rd ray perspective).

a 1st ray perspective has all of the active intelligence of the 2nd and the 3rd ray -- and also of the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th as well, but seen from the opposite perspective. while a 7th ray looks at physical substance or data as real (which produces the desire), the 1st ray sees the desire as already real (and that's what produces the physical substance). their perspectives are the same -- just looked at from opposite directions.

both the 1st ray and 7th ray perspectives are the most complete picture of the thing as they have the active intelligence of the entire specturum, but only one half can be looked at in the forwards direction [TODO: explain this better].
