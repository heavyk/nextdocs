# know-thyself

[OK, I'm just going to start writing here and edit it later. I don't know what I even want to title it yet, but the inspiration comes from a number of different things. I'm going to start over and write it all again, so much of it could be duplicate information -- TODO: DELETE THIS]

this document attempts to put into writing the process whereby I understood myself. I did it mostly by studying women and how they interact. as a result, I've found that this way of looking at things pretty well describes the receptive side, so it can be used to understand receptive people in general.

spectrally speaking, like a carbon atom, a perfect receptor is a perfect emitter -- and vice versa. to be ignorant of one is to misunderstand the other. most people may be surprised to find out that they have a receptive side, thinking they only need to emit what they want to get it, but I assure you, it's often the case that the thing you're looking for is right in front of your face -- and it's actually your own reception that's preventing you from seeing it.

the receptive side, IMO, is far more important than the emissive side because it takes a lot more precision to receive what you want than it does to transmit what you want. precise tuning is a skill that's something like being an audio technician knowing what you want to hear. the sound is out there, but *how* are you going to hear it?

I'll present this data in the female form because I learned it mostly from them. it's also going to be presented as my own experience, so take what resonates with you.

### feedback loops

*we have capacity for all ray types, but it's common to have one more dominant than the others.* so, whatever your dominant ray type is, males tend to more often to be emitters, meaning that they neglect or even avoid their receptive side. males receive their opposite ray type and emit their ray type while females tend to emit and receive their ray type. grounds are less common and they're capable of both emission and reception. my theory is that is mentality influenced by the sex organs (TODO: more on this later), so if you have an atypical arrangement there, you may get different results (this is something I don't have data on and would be very interesting to get more statistics on in the future to improve my understanding).

for males, it seems less common to get a runaway feedback loop by yourself (though it is possible because it's happened to me). however a good example of a runaway feedback loop can happen because of LOA. he emits anger and hatred (5), let's say, and so that attracts more angering physical circumstances (7), and so because he's receptive to those concepts which aggrivate the situation further. so unless those physical circumstances is an inanimate object (or something like getting lost or inability to find something) -- usually for emitters, these feedback loops mostly happen with others (usually good at "pushing your buttons"). also I've noticed that when it does happen to males, it happens when he's in a receptive mode of thinking (discovery, invention, interest, programming, etc).

for grounds, this happens all the time, but usually with interactions with the opposite ray type (so like a 3rd ray and 5th ray or 1st and 7th). opposite ray types compliment eachother, but only when one is receptive to the other. it's very invigourating for me to see the symbolic synopsis of emotion/concept that I feel -- or to look at the reality of a thing instead of the desire (we call this manifestation). however, if you want something and someone else is showing you a reality that you *don't* want, that 1-7 combo can be very very annoying (or to have your complex and detailed emotional situation summed up into a symbolic interaction like, "so you're upset that he doesn't value you").

for females, because most of them are emitting the same energy they're receiving this is the most perfect storm for a runaway feedback loop (just put the mic in front of the speaker and see what happens). so, you can imagine it can be much easier for them to get into runaway feedback situations all the time.

whether you're causing this runaway feedback loop by interacting with someone of opposite ray type as you or all by yourself, the results are pretty similar.

#### importance of the ground in the triad

in the traditional triad of two males and one female -- the female is the powerhouse of the triad. she's the amplifier. typically the emitter is usually uninteresting, ignoring or even neglecting his receptive side (he's usually off kinda doing his own thing), so the ground is the stability for the group, but most importantly for the female. without her, it's pretty easy for her to get off into one of these feedback loops.

#### still a work in progress

as I've been writing this, I've noticed that the runaway feedback loop has two possible directions it could go. it's the same feedback loop but one is perceived in the opposite direction. if this is true, I have yet to discover new feedback loops I hadn't previously thought about; I'm going to figure them out here as I go. so 7 feedback loops according to ray types and two directions for each is my goal.


#### 1st ray

1st ray females tend to be very intense. they experience desire, creation, and destruction all very similarly (at least that's how it is for me). they're very chaotic in that they get an idea of something they want, and it *has* to happen now -- the sooner, the better.

the foundation of creativity is desire, and so when an idea comes, the reality of that idea comes right along with it. this reality is at the opposite end of the spectrum (7), and so it has to traverse all of that distance to get to down into the physical. as a result, anything that feels like it's in the way of that becoming a reality must be removed. this often times results in the destruction of things. she's usually not intentional about it, as most of the time it never make it up into a full-blown thought, but something got destroyed -- that's why I associate desire with chaos and random.

on the opposite end of that spectrum, if she wants to create something, that reality of what she wants to create is so invigourating, that she'll spend long hours fixated intently trying to get the whole thing done in one go. any success or accomplishment creates that feedback loop where she just has to have more. desire is the root of "addiction", and so you may think of this creativity as her source of that good-feeling she's "addicted" to. it's won't feel like an addiction for her though. it already feels like a reality, so she's compelled (acting without thinking) to make that a reality.

on the opposite end of the spectrum, from the perspective of desire, destruction is pretty much the same thing as creativity because the reality of what I want to create is more real to her than the thing standing in the way of that creation.

desire is a very subtle feeling, so often times when something breaks or gets destroyed, we oftentimes feel bad, because the loss of the thing is felt more strongly than the desire for the new thing. so you can imagine that a person that is capable of perceiving the potential reality as real (kids are like this), can get into a runaway feedback loop of destructive behaviour; she'll clear one thing out to make way for the new, and the presence of that new thing (desire) is felt in such a strong way, why limit herself to just making way for one new thing -- why not more? so she destroys more.

#### 2nd ray

a 2nd ray sees the big picture of something. the 2nd ray sits between desire and structure (which is desire mentalised into parts). that means she's aware of the parts, but what she's most conscious of if how all of those parts fit together and work together. she sees all of the things working together in just a certain way. this is her "the right way" from a relational perspective. this usually conflicts with the 3rd ray who also has "the right way" to do things, but the 3rd ray is usually concerned on the individual performance and/or function of the parts, rather than their cooperation with the other parts.

her mind's eye is the opposite to the 6th ray's imagination/perspective -- which usually is just seeing a single part just assuming that part fits into the big picture.

she'll see everything as working together smoothely in her mind's eye, so often times she'll get to trying to become someone else's source -- trying to create their reality for them, because she sees "the right way" where everything works out orderly and properly.

[TODO: I don't see the opposite feedback loop here. that's OK beause 2nd and 4th ray is still difficult for me to see. I understand the 6th ray perspective even though I don't see it, so after that, it may illuminate the opposite loop. revisit.]

#### 3rd ray

the 3rd ray is about segmentation and

#### 7th ray

a 7th ray fixates on data and

### active intelligence conflicts

I'm using the phrase "active intelligence" as a way to say, "what you understand". a 3rd ray understands the 4th ray and the 5th ray, but they are from the opposite perspective (and vise versa for a 5th ray).

this creates conflicts, especially in the transition layers (2, 4, 6) because they usually only see one half of the situation. for example a 6th ray has the active intelligence of a 5th ray, and so for them they "see" the physical as an image in their mind (so it looks ideal or of paranoia), but they're not quite fully "grounded" in the physical reality of things. they can conflict with a 7th ray on being too ideal (or paranoid) or they can conflict with a 5th ray because the 5th ray sees the abstract idea purely and doesn't need to turn it into an image. for the 5th ray, it just is -- an abstract idea. it dosn't have much physicality yet and doesn't need to, until it needs to be put into the right part or segment (3rd ray perspective).

a 1st ray perspective has all of the active intelligence of the 2nd and the 3rd ray -- and also of the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th as well, but seen from the opposite perspective. while a 7th ray looks at physical substance or data as real (which produces the desire), the 1st ray sees the desire as already real (and that's what produces the physical substance). their perspectives are the same -- just looked at from opposite directions.

both the 1st ray and 7th ray perspectives are the most complete picture of the thing as they have the active intelligence of the entire specturum, but only one half can be looked at in the forwards direction [TODO: explain this better].

### constant/fixed speed vs constant/fixed contrast

I noticed that I had wrote "constant contrast", but perhaps that's not what I meant, but it lead me to discover something. it's one of those abstract ideas that if you can get it, you can "get" your trajectory through time.

imagine that you are the root 3 diagonal ofthe cube. it is the shortest path from one corner to the opposite. all the other paths curve off of it and it kinda looks like lightning (there are like tendrils and shit). the points where it bends is when it collides with something and finds a new path of lower resistance to ricochet off in the direction of.

anyway, let us consider the idea of constant or functional (ie. predictable) speed. as an example of this, you will notice my life. the harder that I go (though I have no intention of getting connected), the more they have to clamp down on me. for me, as I learn to overcome their efforts, I feel more and more like a super human every day. super human is a state of being.

I consider that most of the things that people really want, is the feeling -- so, like if I want fame, then I *really* want the feelling of being famous. that's the way I want to feel. if I want to be successful, what I'm saying is I want to *feel* like I'm successful; I have the feelling of success.

OK, now when I consider my speed, certain conditions slow me down, so then LOA has to work harder to get me up to speed (good conditions are provided), but if my conditions are too good, then they actually start to slow me down. all of this is quite an interesting seemingly impossible balance of contrast because my speed keeps speeding up. so, I have to obey the function (ie. the speed limit).

so, what is speed? I'm not totally sure. it's a concept that I translate as speed. I think novelty is speed. that novelty has to be a predictable function (exponential or whatever, but solvable). if my novelty exceeds that function's allotment, nosebook naturally sees that I'm going too fast (like today for example), and so they have to clamp down even harder.

this, essentially make me feel super human, because I can't possibly imagine how much effort it is for them to keep the novelty function from exploding.

this, I noticed is like a child. a child experiences massive amounts of novelty. if you notice me as I walk around, though I don't have the visuals to remark at the novelty of something beautiful, instead I see concepts and interactions everywhere. life is this rich experience with a whole bunch of new things to notice all over the place. it's a lot of fun.

if that novelty goes too fast, you get get that natural DMT rush that pushes you up to the point where you can't allow any more and you say, "this is my space". most of us say, "up to this point in reality and no further." we pick a safe state. for us drug users, you know the space that you got on first high is super duper awesome, but it's pretty difficult to achieve ever again without taking a break for a while.

the thing is, the idea is to get that quantity of novelty passing through the brain so that life is, not only more meaningful, but it means that all perception is enhanced. nobody can stop you from noticing new things and new ways to look at any concept (not just some).

---

now, if that's constant speed, then what is constant/functional contrast? to discover this thought, I noticed that the functional contrast is a sort of (90(degrees) right turn) to functional speed. if one is constant, the other is variable.

most of us live nearer to the constant/functional contrast perspective. we like to be able to predict the thing, and the more predictable (able to be calculated) that contrast (risks) is.

let is first defne what constrast is. contrast is any border between two opositely rotatitng things. when your visual perception gets enhanced, you'll notice that all of the edges on everything are more defined. this is a conceptual perception. the conceptual world is pure chaos, but you begin to make sense of the signals and turn that (including the signal data that your body receives like from the eyes or ears) and paints it to you visually.

when I look at things in the conceptual, things are really separated from each other -- however, you'll notice that they are always *your* concepts (the ones programmed into the brain) that separates them. so, the more concepts you have the better you can see the "distance" between different things.

when I first started out, a lot of things were very similar in how they felt and I was pretty inaccurate. I don't consider myself in any way to have good accuracy now, and so I can always get better. one of the ways I got better really fast is to compare feellings, and notice that difference. the more comparisons I have, the more concepts I have (which is why a person with a self-constructed reality is conceptually *much* different to another with a culturally-constructed reality).

each comparison (notice how that just felt; makes, a new concept). each conceptual addition (ie novelty) is another reference point in the dimension that you're in. I don't know how it is for others where they're really far out there, but for me concepts now have quitte a distance between them all now (at least from my perception), that they come through clear even though I don't have a physical sensation. it's another sense really.

WOAH, back on track, here. let's get back to looking at contrast as two *oppositely rotating* -- which, if you remember the thing on magnetism, this is the repelling force.

nosebook is my main source of contrast. the faster I go, the more they need to clamp down. so, for example, I'm going to have to "pay" for this by nosebook finding a new way to slow me down further. it'll slow me down in the short-run, but later on in the long-run, I had to learn from it (novelty) and I got to experience a lot of really important things that will actually speed me up later (causing them to push harder). however, because they're regulating my speed, that means I get to experience variable contrast; because, I seemingly (from my perspective) don't ever really feel like I'm accelerating (ie. constant speed), then I would have to live a pretty routine life as a hermet.

however, because I'm around a lot of other people, what ends up happening is that they can push as hard as they want against me and it won't be anything but a reflection. on the subject of the way that our eyes perceive, I am a near perfect reflector now (like silver), so whatever concept in my experience, it won't affect my speed, so it reflects back pefectly.

the individual aspects of the reflection process is emission and absorption, which in that case, I don't actually believe myself to be a perfect reflector at all. I do retransmit a different signal -- so it's not really a mirror -- but, maybe -- a rose tinted mirror. I see what I want to see, so I refect back what I like seeing combined with your thoughts and concepts.

to illustrate this point, if you've ever walked on the streets in spain (something I did frequently), the street lamps are all sodium bulbs, so at night everything has this strange orange/yellow tint to it. I noticed that when my eyesight was enhanced after watching stars, that the street lights no longer painted everything yellow/orange any more. everythting appeared like some super luminous space where everything sparkled and stuff.

hold up, wait a minute; something, aint right.

the sparkes are cool, but how in the world did the colours change back to the way that I see them during the day even though the sodium lamps are still painting them yellow/orange? this is that reflective property in action. even though I'm seeing the physical, I am *simultaneously* projecting outward the way that I see things. if my presence is strong enough, people can see theirselves how I see them. this could be inspiring or very very annoying, depending on where he person is. I don't like to superimpose my perspective over another person because it limits them to my perception, when what they really want is to figure it out for theirselves because that's the max novelty.

I do realise that max novelty (fixed speed) is not usually most people's people's preference, that's perfectly fine. I'm aware that the majority of others will just be another reference point in space without much differentiation or individuality -- so I'm just saying why I like the way that I'm going.

basically max novelty is increasing your amount of novelty to a level where you feel comfortable at doing to maintain the space (breathing, yoga, etc.) and then you sorta take the foot off of the accelerator and let the traffic set the speed (I imagine it perhaps  like a self-driving car). once your speed is regulated by the system (they'll keep you in your space, wherever that is), now you can begin to experience novelty an an unpresidented rate.

the more novelty that you experience (this is the mind (perception) like a child where everything appears new and has a sparkle tto it because it's another dimension that's not yet in it's place yet), the more things sparkle, and because everything sparkles, each new thing is even more awesome than the last -- and it keeps rising -- until the child says, "no more. this is a measured reality where I feel like I can predict it". the more predictable that life gets, the more functional/predictable constrast (perceived as conceptual borders).

the better you are at predicting your reality, the more (meaningfully) HD life will become. you now have more and more borders to other oppositely rotating concepts, where there is another dimension to feel the concept. the more proabilities play into our everyday conversation, the more mental dimensions will be added. you can imagine that a sort of probable realities matrix graph where people have pretty much agreed on the manifestation of certain realities.

conceptually rich things for relatively little effort

#### why is it (meaningfully) HD?

when you can see your life as a series of possible paths, you now select your path, and the path that anyone takes is not usually the shortest route (3), but instead, we prefer the most *meaningful* -- and that meaning is always unique to the inddividual.

as an example, imagine you can see three major paths that are possible for you (it's a three tines fork), and so you look at them and because you have some time to choose, you have a look at the various options and notice how some things have certain resonant qualities or aspects that are *meaningfully* more desirable -- and then, after some deliberation, a person will pick the thing with the most meaning to them.

for example, if I say, "I don't know. I always pick the wrong one, I pick the one that I think is wrong. or, if they value how they feel, then the thing that feels the best will feel more meaningful.

each comparison makes a new dimension *between concepts*; get enough of those toether and groups and patters start to emerge which begin to suggest there is another dimension that's needed to make sense of the feeling/signal.
