### 2022-09-14 05:11 - elemental summoning

this morning, I finally figured out the puzzle. I'm basically seeing things usually from the 1st down, but rarely do I see it from the 7th ray perspective (they keep me in the clouds cause evcerything is so abstract).

I mentioned the elemental summoning and jack parsons and stuff like that and then this morning I was thinking about joe in xyla's video (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_7e90FspY)) because when I was watching him he reminded me for some reason a lot of jack parsons. I didn't really know what to make of it.

this morning I was thinking further about the idea of sexually summoning an elemental for yourself, and that this is kinda like the physical reality "punishment" for yourself, and that strong creative/desire summons an elemental here because the energy has no where else to go (reached the limit), so it begins to form into reality and this arrives as that desire in physically manifest form.

just a side note on this one: my own strong desire, especially because of these revelations, I'm beginning to see that I summoned all of my "bad-guys" and they're just these elementals.

also a note on what I think elementals are first. imagine that our planet is confined to a bandwidth, and so when energies exceed those limits, the energy is aborbed and remitted (different than reflection), and it's in that reemission that is 5th ray, and that concept goes around and eventually find a suitable body to get into, and they get to you when you're ready.

the mechanism for this to be pssible is this female in question genxicat (maybe I'll just call her puma, actually). ok, so puma (it feels so weird so say that) is a 7th ray shapeshifter, and she shapeshifts because she contains both 5th and 7th ray capability, so she projects down out of time (4d) into the 3d where that elemental takes on her qualities, but confined into the physical (DNA, body shape) and into that physical body, the desire is confined.

it's really weird to call her puma, but I'll keep doing it. anyway, so I noticed one thing that all of these guys really have in common, and it's the "he would really like mars" in the feminine, "wow she would really dislike the mars macho supertype" type of perspective, but because the elemental that is summoned comes into mars' energy. look at that again: they all really like (or hate) mars, but they are incarnated into mars' own physical format. look no further than the LGBTQ stuff to understand that.

so here's the thing that I think is happening, is that there are a lot of elementals here they can be either male or female, and probably depending on the charge, will have strong desire for or against the mars prototype. I'm almost certainly an elemental. probably my father's.

anyway, the whole point of me showing the mars stuff is that  is that inside of us, this conflict exists. you are who you like (I am mars and I like mars)

in practicality, let's say you were a female and you were created with negative desire, so on the exterior (physical body) you really find mars very repulsive, but on the inside you really like mars, because you yourself is mars (if you see yourself as a body).

all elementals are all basically her on the inside (mars on outside) though. that means that from a conceptual perspective, I am (all elementals are), a 7th ray female (puma) from thme conceptual perspective. from a physical perspective, I am (all elementals are, regardless of their gender) 7th ray male from a physical perspective.

that means that you'll continue on perpetually really liking (or hating) other elementals like yourself, until you finally like yourself enough to keep minimise attraction to other elementals of opposite reflection (again gender doesn't matter).

it does mean we're all shapeshifters, but you gatta *like yourself* to find it or -- you'll be perpetually attracted to the ideal meanifestation of the present vibration. in the inside (conecptually) she (puma) is also really attracted to herself, which is probably the reason for a lot of the vanity. almost certainily the source of many rockstars, honestly. since that time (the babalon working?) people started to summon for therselves elementals of a reflection of the strong desire in physical form.

when the elemental is created, it's imbued with the energy of the desire that created it. that's where they start out, but each successive desire creates new desires, and so every moment you're not the same you once were. every moment you flash into existence as the concept you believe yourself to be. imagine the refresh rate of reality actually increases as you change your vibration, and as that vibration rises, you'll realise yourself more and more to "be the universe" -- which is a concept that's easy to say, but difficult to explain, because I don't know how to say the perspective. just imagine that at one point the world is filled with so many versions of you that know theirselves to be the universe, that it's enough to realise a new universe, a reflection of my perception. your concept of reality expands from the "I" perspective. like, I am a species on a planet, then I am a trund in the galaxy, etc. I'm really attractive. something like that. I think it's hard to grasp because you have to hold (feel?) more than one concept in the mind at once order to see the bigger picture. I only translated a few of its concepts. there are likely quite a few more.

so look at it how as soon as you desire it, she appears, from your perspective that she grew up in a location on earth and found her way to you, but from the conceptual perspective, all of the life, including the birth and death are known as soon as they're confined the physical form at anytime as it's summoned into the timeline. the timeline can obviously change making the original trajectory a little bit off, so we all arrive here as the difference in the timeline between the summoning (conception) of the desire and in the manifestation. in the case of sex magick, this is conception and it usually takes about 9m for the manifestation of that concept to appear. however, it could be for any size of desire, not necessarily confined to any set of actions[^1] that produced it.

so summoning of that desire gets a concept associated with it in abstract/cyberspace[^2], and that concept develops over time the more desire is put into the desire. each desire eventually reaches enough desire to be able to splash over into the 7th ray.

+-------------------------------------------------+
|   earth's confined upper limit (light speed)
|   spills over more and more into the physical
|   more desire = more physical
+-------------------------------------------------+
|   desire
+-------------------------------------------------+
|   sun/stars (conditional limit)
+-------------------------------------------------+
|  symbolic rules and strutcture. (final limit)
+-------------------------------------------------+


anything exceeding this effect gets turned into the concept that you think it'll be. you know that when you have sex, you believed you would get lightning instead of a child. we think it's the sex that does it, but it's just desire that produces the manifestation into physical. it can be produced without sex just fine and that's kinda how we create reality, where all desire start to spill over into the physical as a refelction of the concept that it's believed to be. this is any PK or whatever. a small desire can start out as a bit of a movement (attraction) and turn into energy or matter, depending on the concept that energy is believed to be.

the next thing that I want to note is the lower limit confines, which is entirely conditional. there isn't a lower limit and goes all the way to zero and even negative. if you desire something that doesn't have a condition on it, meaning that the stars have no concept of it, then I would imagine that this is the source of a singularity.

it's a growing desire that has enormous negative numbers (worst possible manifestation?), and the reason why it can get so low is because there are no rules for that desire (self, cultural, planet, star, or galaxy, or logic, or maths), then all those desires that were at a frequency for which there was no conceptual rule for, goes accumulating for quite some time until it (the wpm) eventually shows up. it's all of the desire that has no rules for. it's the source of humour and laugher because you don't know how to process it, so it causes your body to spasm in reflection of that desire. for a moment when you laugh, you can feel a small portion of that ruleless desire.

you can see that it works in the opposite way too in the form of fear. the shiver that you feel when your scared is the same as laughter, but those feelings don't feel good according to your own rules. as abraham said, look for them not where they *were*, but where they are now (without all of the physical resistance). those rules confine the manifestation.

you can see how rules are the opposite of concepts. the most basic rule is that things which don't have a concept don't exist. this is a blank conceptual storage (one built in rule), but obviously culture, self, society, etc. all add to that ruleset. they're just the "preinstalled apps" that you get when using USA as your baby provider.

so, you grow up your life thinking that all the stuff that doesn't have a concept, can't actually exist. from the conceptual perspective, you're always right becasuse you literally can't see outside of your own concepts.

the most elusive concept for us to grasp: I can only see what I can conceptualise.

now, I just noticed something peculiar. when I was younger I didn't masturbate. I also had magnificent amount of "wet dreams" but I don't ever remember seeing any visuals. I didn't masturbate until after I had the brain haemorrhage.

I also can't really remember how it happened, because in one timeline it took me a long time to masturbate (like well into my 20s), and there is another that I did it probably like days after getting out of the hospital. it's unclear to me which one happened, but the interesting thing to note is that from my perspective now, they both produced the same results (me now), so from my perspective, they're the same manifestation.

all possibilities of manifesttions eventually converge, as my perspective changes. the more "enlightened" I become, the more I notice how I could have gotten to the point I am now from many many diffrent paths. that basically means that we are actually the ones confining the matrix, because as we go out noticing all concepts as one, it destroys the matrix' capacity to create more unique combinations. I used the matrix to denote the difference between the human implementation of this system (cyberspace) and the actual frequency spectrum of our being. we're the worst enemy of cyberspace, because desires that have no rules start to show up. they think that no thing that isn't a concept is actually real, so how in the world to they deal with ruleless concepts showing up.

I used "they" there because I wanted to note later that there are a lot of people like that, myself included. they need to need to be right because if it doesn't exist in their concepts, it can't possibly exist.

what's the solution? obviously, you have to believe that you are the universe, because it's only true way for the statement, "no concept outside of what I know exists". you have to know yourself as being the whole universe (source, cosmic giggle, etc).

#### cosmic giggle

now, I would like to talk about the cosmic giggle. I belive it's the worst possible manifestation (wpm) because you can see that someone that is so pessimistic will attract *all possible realities*. an optimist will attract only the optimistic realities, but a pessimist attracts every possible combination. you could say that anything aware of and experiencing the worst possible mainfestation (in their percception), is always relative to the speed they're going.

if you're going a million miles per hour toward something, the WPM may be slowing down to 950k, or it could be speeding up to 1100k, or something whatever. after a while the WPM will look less and less bleak until it's not that terrible at all. eventually with having gained so much experience and having seen so many disasters turn out OK (in the end) the WPM will look less and less bleak until it goes into pure optimism. it's a bit of a paradox. the worst pessimist is actually the greatest optimist. this is the 1-7 relationship again. desire (optimist), is very limited in its manifestation (cause an optimist can only want and manifest the best), so a possimist after sufficient exprience will become an optimist because he's seen everything and notice that it always works out for the better given a sufficient span of time.

so just imagine now a clump of all of these guys that are going so fast, nobody else is even close because they're just pessimists (of a certain quantity -- some more and some less), rathar than eternal pessimists -- which is looking at the worst possible manifestation from the eternal (all-that-is) perspective and they know that it's all totally fine because even the worst possible manifestation isn't all that bad. abraham calls that "source" but it's the same as the cosmic giggle: "looks like you've been deisring a lot, but you can only see the worst possible manifestation coming. so, get ready for the worst possible manifesation then"

you can also consider the WPM the clump of souls that we would call the ancestors; a bunch of dead people. none of them made it to where they wanted to go and all ended up in the WPM. so it's like also heaven -- and hell, because its the worst.

it's a lot of things man. you can see it everywhere. it's a reflection of you, if that's who you think you are; otherwise, it looks like someone else.

[1]: yeah, I noted it as weird that I thought of actions as a medium, but it kinda is when I think about it, so I wanted to note it.

[2]: this sounds like I'm creating a religion where I'm redefining the abstract to be "cyberspace" (nosebook). nice try guys.

### 2022-09-14 11:02 - I think I figured out the timewave

to start off, let me begin from the beginning. the earth is a star, but it's manifestation is confined to the physical spectrum probably by things like the pyramid and stuff like that. what it means though, is that all of this stuff we think of as matter is just light manifest by the central sun.

I believe that there isn't much difference between planet and star, other than their paths are opposite. a planet wants to emit light more like a star, and a star wants to emit emit matter. all stars emit matter, but I think that ours is confined by the moon and other things, so we see the manifestation of material things on the surface of the earth star. just note this for what I want to say next.

we are all elementals, meaning that all of us are starting out as the difference in vibration between conception and birth, and so if you put that individual into an environment, the concepts of that environment will produce a sort of machine that interacts with the environment in a predictable way.

novelty is the realisation that you want to do something different than the predicted way, so novelty is a sort of glitch in the machine of entities all interacting in their predicted way (reflections, reemissions, and absorbtions), as it produces something that happens which *isn't* predicted. novelty is the predictor's worst nightmare.

so, imagine that you constructed the earth in such a way that all of the species on the planet would have vibrational interactions between each other and other concepts at a pretty predictable rate (mating, eating, and everything "instinctual") such that what results is a formula which can generalise and itself even predict when there will be enough desire to produce something new (novelty). it's a sort of generalised function that assumes that all species have an amount of unwanted that they contribute to the WPM and when enough unwanted is accumplated, the WPM happens and new species/concepts are created to house the new form which up until that point did not have a conceptual container to fit the manifestation into.

you can imagine that the most influential vibrations is the sun and planets (then species and genus), so if you live in a machine, figuring out how the planets affect the machinery, it helps greatly to predict the ebbs and flows of certain things. astrology really good a long time ago when we weren't very conscious, but now that we're so much more conscious, novety is happening much much more.

so now imagine for a moment that everyone on this planet is an "elemental" and that we all start out programmed to seek the vibration that we're at. at first, it's clockwork, but as mure and more novelty happens, all bets are off as to what will happen. from that point, we're consciously creating our reality. this is probably that dividing line that I see in the creation of a new dimension, pushing 4d down to the lowest.

this new dimension above desire seems to have to do with don quixote. I was learning yesterday that don quixote is weird because there's a blur between the narrator and the writer of the book, but also the author seems to also be in the story as well. he's a sort of self-referntial narrator of his own story, where the automaton writing the story down, from time to time says, "wait what?"

so if I do the transformation on the dimensions, that means that the new one is going to become a primary and the layer I call 2nd ray moves down to become the opposite of that. 2nd ray is seeing everything as being connected and mutually influential, but the narrator will want to see it as push; kinda the same as how desire presently pushes on 3rd ray rules and symbols. it also means that 4th ray perception (I am you for a moment) now becomes the concept of ourself -- so we're a sort of group consciousness. we are human. indicidulisation now happens at what is now the conceptual level and is manifested into 4d reality.

that may have been too abstract. I'll try and figure out a way to look at it later. anyway, as I was writing that, I was wondering because I conceived of *two* new layers, not just one, which would put us as opposite the opposite, so kinda in the position of where desire is now but in physical form.. the whole system is mirrored twice. I may want to explore both of those later. the thought that just came to me now is that if I go for lots of contrast I can do two layers, but if I only go for minimal contrast I only have enough for one more layer (because making a layer requires a WPM, so I would need another WPM on the next dimension above this -- which I'm planning on over-enginneering anyway) interesting... inotherwords, how many solar cycles can I go for in a row where I produce the WPM?

anyway, the singularity that terence saw at the end of the timewave is when the amount of novelty gets so high, the effects of the species and the planets gets to be so negligible that it no longer can be considered as an accurate predictor.

### 2022-09-14 13:28 - stability of the 2nd ray

the 2nd ray stands between desire and structure and so maintains equibrium by expanding or contracting due to pressures coming from both sides (yes, like a vagina). the reason why it needs to be constant is that it maintains the proportions of both of its sides. so for example, notice how the giza pyramid constrains the 7th ray by expanding only on the conceptual side. that's the same thing but from the 6th ray perspective (moon).

the fourth is the same but between physical and non-physical and it too needs to maintain everything in porportion; the physical and spiritual. all must be balanced and in proportion. you could imagine the 4th ray's perspective is from that of the divine geometer, giving proportions to all things physical in relation to their non-physical couterparts. they like shapes. a lot.

at any rate, the 2nd ray is balancing desire and sructure. think of desire of as a cloud of non-harmonius vibrations (all the unwanted stuff). those vibrations interact with each other and then sometimes become powerful enough to pass down into structure.

down in structure, what you see there are these constantly self transforming configurations of perspective that input vibration from the 4th (which came from physical), then they transform, emit, absorb, or reflect (TEAR) the energy back. these barriers act as sort of barriers between layers. the only way through is transformation: absorb and reemit on the other side.

you could consider this reality now as having the properties of the matrix above it, so for example, the imagination takes in concepts and then reemits them into physical as signals. this is such a membrane.

to visualise this, we can look at the planet, and see that there is a certain logic and structure for the passage through the membrane: you have to have the right sequence. don't just think that this exists in the physical like DNA, but it's also in the non-physical too as the different configurations for perception. they're sorta like routers to see if you can pass through the dojo without getting reflected or retransmitted.

to visualise that, let's look again to the 2nd ray. you have this desire that comes blazing through and it has to be routed to go in the right direction before it hits physical. you know, so it hits the right concepts, which then produce our imaginary reality. the imaginary reality is what you believe is real. it requires access to the concept and a set of signals in the brain to process that concept into "reality". we just pretty well agree on a lot of reality, so it stays pretty constant.

a philosopher bridges this gap because he is able to take in a set of concepts and rearrange, throw out, transform the concepts until they fit into a new structure, which then that new logic then becomes the new barrier that must be surpassed in order to pass between layers. be rearranging the form and the content of the concepts, he reduces (or expands) the barrier between concepts.

### 2022-09-18 04:17 - an altered state of consciousness called mindlessness

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/tRvko3rCCAU?t=333)

this reminded me directly of the "garden of eden" mindset, where we're just in the garden, not in either of the trees; *just* the garden; a gnostic trance; somewhere between waking and sleeping.
