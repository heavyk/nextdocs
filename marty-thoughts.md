### 2022-09-14 05:11 - elemental summoning

this morning, I finally figured out the puzzle. I'm basically seeing things usually from the 1st down, but rarely do I see it from the 7th ray perspective (they keep me in the clouds cause evcerything is so abstract).

I mentioned the elemental summoning and jack parsons and stuff like that and then this morning I was thinking about joe in xyla's video (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_7e90FspY)) because when I was watching him he reminded me for some reason a lot of jack parsons. I didn't really know what to make of it.

this morning I was thinking further about the idea of sexually summoning an elemental for yourself, and that this is kinda like the physical reality "punishment" for yourself, and that strong creative/desire summons an elemental here because the energy has no where else to go (reached the limit), so it begins to form into reality and this arrives as that desire in physically manifest form.

just a side note on this one: my own strong desire, especially because of these revelations, I'm beginning to see that I summoned all of my "bad-guys" and they're just these elementals.

also a note on what I think elementals are first. imagine that our planet is confined to a bandwidth, and so when energies exceed those limits, the energy is aborbed and remitted (different than reflection), and it's in that reemission that is 5th ray, and that concept goes around and eventually find a suitable body to get into, and they get to you when you're ready.

the mechanism for this to be pssible is this female in question genxicat (maybe I'll just call her puma, actually). ok, so puma (it feels so weird so say that) is a 7th ray shapeshifter, and she shapeshifts because she contains both 5th and 7th ray capability, so she projects down out of time (4d) into the 3d where that elemental takes on her qualities, but confined into the physical (DNA, body shape) and into that physical body, the desire is confined.

it's really weird to call her puma, but I'll keep doing it. anyway, so I noticed one thing that all of these guys really have in common, and it's the "they would really like mars" type of perspective, but because the elemental that is summoned comes into mars' energy. look at that again: they all really like mars, but they are incarnated into mars' own physical format (wich is like a conceptual shapeshifter).

so here's the thing that I think is happening, is that there are a lot of elementals here. I'm almost certainly an elemental at this point. probably my father's. anyway, the whole point is that inside of you, you really like yourself, and since you are like so many others, you also really like many others that are like you. elementals can be male or female in appearance, but they're all basically her on the inside, and that's the source of the "I like mars. I'm searching for mars" sorta vibe that I get.

that means that you'll continue on perpetually really liking other elementals like yourself, until you finally like yourself enough to keep yourself out of the opposite reflections of your vibrations.

you gatta *like yourself* or else you'll be perpetually attracted to the ideal meanifestation of the vibration that created the elemental (sorry, it wasn't obvious). it's also really attracted to herself as well, and that's the reason for a lot of the vanity. probably the source of rockstars, honestly. since that time (the babalon working?) people started to summon for therselves elementals of a reflection of the strong desire in physical form.

so look at it how as soon as you desire it, she appears, from your perspective that she grew up in a location on earth and found her way to you, but from the conceptual perspective, all of the life, including the birth and death are known as soon as they're confined the physical form at anytime as it's summoned into the timeline. the timeline can obviously change making the original trajectory a little bit off, so we all arrive here as the difference in the timeline between the summoning of the desire, and in the case of sex magick, this is conception, but it could be for any size of desire, not necessarily confined to any set of actions[^1] that produced it.

so summoning of that desire gets a concept associated with it in abstract/cyberspace[^2], and that concept develops over time the more desire is put into the desire. each desire eventually reaches enough desire to be able to splash over into the 7th ray.

+-------------------------------------------------+
|   earth's confined upper limit (light speed)
|   spills over more and more into the physical
|   more desire = more physical
+-------------------------------------------------+
|   desire
+-------------------------------------------------+
|   sun/stars (conditional limit)
+-------------------------------------------------+
|  symbolic rules and strutcture. (final limit)
+-------------------------------------------------+


anything exceeding this effect gets turned into the concept that you think it'll be. you know that when you have sex, you believed you would get lightning instead of a child. we think it's the sex that does it, but it's just desire that produces the manifestation into physical. it can be produced without sex just fine and that's kinda how we create reality, where all desire start to spill over into the physical as a refelction of the concept that it's believed to be. this is any PK or whatever. a small desire can start out as a bit of a movement (attraction) and turn into energy or matter, depending on the concept that energy is believed to be.

the next thing that I want to note is the lower limit confines, which is entirely conditional. there isn't a lower limit and goes all the way to zero and even negative. if you desire something that doesn't have a condition on it, meaning that the stars have no concept of it, then I would imagine that this is the source of a singularity.

it's a growing desire that has enormous negative numbers (worst possible manifestation?), and the reason why it can get so low is because there are no rules for that desire (self, cultural, planet, star, or galaxy, or logic, or maths), then all those desires that were at a frequency for which there was no conceptual rule for, goes accumulating for quite some time until it (the wpm) eventually shows up. it's all of the desire that has no rules for. it's the source of humour and laugher because you don't know how to process it, so it causes your body to spasm in reflection of that desire. for a moment when you laugh, you can feel a small portion of that ruleless desire.

you can see that it works in the opposite way too in the form of fear. the shiver that you feel when your scared is the same as laughter, but those feelings don't feel good according to your own rules. as abraham said, look for them not where they *were*, but where they are now (without all of the physical resistance). those rules confine the manifestation.

you can see how rules are the opposite of concepts. the most basic rule is that things which don't have a concept don't exist. this is a blank conceptual storage (one built in rule), but obviously culture, self, society, etc. all add to that ruleset. they're just the "preinstalled apps" that you get when using USA as your baby provider.

so, you grow up your life thinking that all the stuff that doesn't have a concept, can't actually exist. from the conceptual perspective, you're always right becasuse you literally can't see outside of your own concepts.

the most elusive concept for us to grasp: I can only see what I can conceptualise.

now, I just noticed something peculiar. when I was younger I didn't masturbate. I also had magnificent amount of "wet dreams" but I don't ever remember seeing any visuals. I didn't masturbate until after I had the brain haemorrhage.

I also can't really remember how it happened, because in one timeline it took me a long time to masturbate (like well into my 20s), and there is another that I did it probably like days after getting out of the hospital. it's unclear to me which one happened, but the interesting thing to note is that from my perspective now, they both produced the same results (me now), so from my perspective, they're the same manifestation.

all possibilities of manifesttions eventually converge, as my perspective changes. the more "enlightened" I become, the more I notice how I could have gotten to the point I am now from many many diffrent paths. that basically means that we are actually the ones confining the matrix, because as we go out noticing all concepts as one, it destroys the matrix' capacity to create more unique combinations. I used the matrix to denote the difference between the human implementation of this system (cyberspace) and the actual frequency spectrum of our being. we're the worst enemy of cyberspace, because desires that have no rules start to show up. they think that no thing that isn't a concept is actually real, so how in the world to they deal with ruleless concepts showing up.

I used "they" there because I wanted to note later that there are a lot of people like that, myself included. they need to need to be right because if it doesn't exist in their concepts, it can't possibly exist.

what's the solution? obviously, you have to believe that you are the universe, because it's only true way for the statement, "no concept outside of what I know exists". you have to know yourself as being the whole universe (source, cosmic giggle, etc).

#### cosmic giggle

now, I would like to talk about the cosmic giggle. I belive it's the worst possible manifestation (wpm) because you can see that someone that is so pessimistic will attract *all possible realities*. an optimist will attract only the optimistic realities, but a pessimist attracts every possible combination. you could say that anything aware of and experiencing the worst possible mainfestation (in their percception), is always relative to the speed they're going.

if you're going a million miles per hour toward something, the WPM may be slowing down to 950k, or it could be speeding up to 1100k, or something whatever. after a while the WPM will look less and less bleak until it's not that terrible at all. eventually with having gained so much experience and having seen so many disasters turn out OK (in the end) the WPM will look less and less bleak until it goes into pure optimism. it's a bit of a paradox. the worst pessimist is actually the greatest optimist. this is the 1-7 relationship again. desire (optimist), is very limited in its manifestation (cause an optimist can only want and manifest the best), so a possimist after sufficient exprience will become an optimist because he's seen everything and notice that it always works out for the better given a sufficient span of time.

so just imagine now a clump of all of these guys that are going so fast, nobody else is even close because they're just pessimists (of a certain quantity -- some more and some less), rathar than eternal pessimists -- which is looking at the worst possible manifestation from the eternal (all-that-is) perspective and they know that it's all totally fine because even the worst possible manifestation isn't all that bad. abraham calls that "source" but it's the same as the cosmic giggle: "looks like you've been deisring a lot, but you can only see the worst possible manifestation coming. so, get ready for the worst possible manifesation then"

you can also consider the WPM the clump of souls that we would call the ancestors; a bunch of dead people. none of them made it to where they wanted to go and all ended up in the WPM. so it's like also heaven -- and hell, because its the worst.

it's a lot of things man. you can see it everywhere. it's a reflection of you, if that's who you think you are; otherwise, it looks like someone else.

[1]: yeah, I noted it as weird that I thought of actions as a medium, but it kinda is when I think about it, so I wanted to note it.

[2]: this sounds like I'm creating a religion where I'm redefining the abstract to be "cyberspace" (nosebook). nice try guys.
