### 2022-09-14 05:11 - elemental summoning

this morning, I finally figured out the puzzle. I'm basically seeing things usually from the 1st down, but rarely do I see it from the 7th ray perspective (they keep me in the clouds cause evcerything is so abstract).

I mentioned the elemental summoning and jack parsons and stuff like that and then this morning I was thinking about joe in xyla's video (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_7e90FspY)) because when I was watching him he reminded me for some reason a lot of jack parsons. I didn't really know what to make of it.

this morning I was thinking further about the idea of sexually summoning an elemental for yourself, and that this is kinda like the physical reality "punishment" for yourself, and that strong creative/desire summons an elemental here because the energy has no where else to go (reached the limit), so it begins to form into reality and this arrives as that desire in physically manifest form.

just a side note on this one: my own strong desire, especially because of these revelations, I'm beginning to see that I summoned all of my "bad-guys" and they're just these elementals.

also a note on what I think elementals are first. imagine that our planet is confined to a bandwidth, and so when energies exceed those limits, the energy is aborbed and remitted (different than reflection), and it's in that reemission that is 5th ray, and that concept goes around and eventually find a suitable body to get into, and they get to you when you're ready.

the mechanism for this to be pssible is this female in question genxicat (maybe I'll just call her puma, actually). ok, so puma (it feels so weird so say that) is a 7th ray shapeshifter, and she shapeshifts because she contains both 5th and 7th ray capability, so she projects down out of time (4d) into the 3d where that elemental takes on her qualities, but confined into the physical (DNA, body shape) and into that physical body, the desire is confined.

it's really weird to call her puma, but I'll keep doing it. anyway, so I noticed one thing that all of these guys really have in common, and it's the "they would really like mars" type of perspective, but because the elemental that is summoned comes into mars' energy. look at that again: they all really like mars, but they are incarnated into mars' own physical format (wich is like a conceptual shapeshifter).

so here's the thing that I think is happening, is that there are a lot of elementals here. I'm almost certainly an elemental at this point. probably my father's. anyway, the whole point is that inside of you, you really like yourself, and since you are like so many others, you also really like many others that are like you. elementals can be male or female in appearance, but they're all basically her on the inside, and that's the source of the "I like mars. I'm searching for mars" sorta vibe that I get.

that means that you'll continue on perpetually really liking other elementals like yourself, until you finally like yourself enough to keep yourself out of the opposite reflections of your vibrations.
