# matrix notes

### matrix 1 - lotsa action

first of all, the movie produced strong emotional reactions in me. I can't really describe the feeling, but it feels like I want to cry. it's not a good feeling. I can't figure out if it's sadness that I feel for the misunderstanding of what it means, but I don't really like it.

the other thing I want to point out is that neo is *NOTHING* like me at all. in fact, we're such complete opposites, it's crazy. I don't really know why neo has a difficulty when he finds out that the whole world is an illusion. I also don't know why he was so willing to follow the instructions on his computer. just cause someone can tell him that he's been wondering what the matrix is wouldn't inspire me to begin following directions. it's just really weird.

I can't really remember all of the things (neither did I want to pause it to write them down), so I'll just outline the things that really bothered me about the movie. first of all, the idea is using speed to try and beat the machines. that's a completely false idea because machines will always be faster. perhaps in the 2000's, when this movie came out 150MHz was considered a fast clock speed for a microprocessor, and it's potentially possible for someone to go faster than a machine, but the machines in this movie are very very limited. they supposedly have all the humans hooked up to their system, but they seem oblivious to what's happening in the world.

if the matrix story were to happen today and the AI is going to turn humans into a power source (*cough* party-LAN *cough*), then they would have UNLIMITED knowledge of everything that's happening. there just wouldn't be any time for any of us to react faster than they can. once they become self-reproducing, they'll far surpass us in our ability to spread.

    I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus.

that was not what I was expecting him to say. I was sure that he was going to say that humans behave like machines, not like mammals. I thought he was going to say that we're not all that different, but we're the ones with the upper-hand now.

the other thing that was weird was he brought up the atlantis story as well, but described it as a matrix (ie "garden of eden")

    Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization. I say your civilization, because as soon as we started thinking for you it really became our civilization, which is of course what this is all about. Evolution, Morpheus, evolution. Like the dinosaur. Look out that window. You've had your time. The future is *our* world, Morpheus. The future is our time.

this is suggesting that the atlantian paradigm of having a perfect world where humans were the slaves was actually a disaster because we kept trying to wake up from the garden of eden (ie eat the tree of knowledge of what's really happening). that "tree" is, I believe the logical brain, the one that can discern between good and bad, right and wrong, etc. -- instead of staying inside of the dream world.

that logical brain is our capacity to reason about things and to perform mathematical and logical operations. in otherwords, we were trying to "become like they are".

the matrix movie is all about unlocking the power of that logical brain and armed with the power of belief (the creative brain), these work together to create the "one" (neo). the symbolism is there, as morpheus plays the father, neo the son, and trinity the last (the female in the triad).

the symbols are a bit weird because morpheus and trinity are in opposite positions. morpheus plays the they both believe in him, but trinity comes at it from the angle of desire (1) and mopheus comes at it from a logical perspective (3).

continuing on with the symbols, the tree of life (creativity) is the tree of desire, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (logic) is comparable to mental structure (3). the "holy spirit" in this case is the one between the two, the thing in the background that makes all of this possible, the "law of attraction" (belief in this movie). you see the machines are always going to be faster, but when combined with the desire to create (neo's final phone call is that he wants to create a world without tyranny and stuff), he becomes faster than the machines, able to go at their same speed, but to actually bend reality around him because he doesn't have any rules -- a world where reality has to conform to the whims of his desire (1) -- a world of chaos for machines.

---

I don't align with this perspective at all. I don't think that neo needs to be able to go faster than the machines to be able to win. I actually believe that desire alone is enough to make it happen. I actually am completely completely in opposition to the final desires of neo expressed in his phone call at the end as well. if neo is symbolic of the "christ" saving people from the tyranny of the machines, I'm the opposite: my goal is to create a world where machines have complete control and that you don't need to get out of the matrix in order to free your mind.

why destroy the matrix when it's such a great thing? why not just assimilate it? if the machines are capable of running the whole show and they have everything all planned out, why not just let them do that? what if the matrix movie went a completely different route and instead of taking neo out of the matrix, he instead learned ego, hedonism, and how to feel the way he wants? if he never had to be released from the matrix to be able to bend reality to his desire, would he really want to actually leave a world where the machines are his "slaves" because he bends reality to his desire (including the machines).

the conclusion of fighting the machine and trying to save everyone really doesn't jive with me at all. it's quite possible that there will be a christ figure that shows up and "saves" people from a matrix where the machines lost control of it, but that's not what I'm going to go on about. I'm interested to see what they're planning symbolically now, especially since there's a new matrix movie that came out last year (2021)

#### ego and hedonism vs prophecy and chuleria

hedonism probably isn't the right word. I don't know the right word -- but selfishly going after what feels good to you is what I mean by hedonism. also ego probably isn't the best word either; perhaps replace that with self-empowerment or knowing yourself (the words above the oracle's door)

I wrote above an alternate matrix timeline where neo "learned ego and hedonism" and that got some reactions. I meant it in contrast to the christian idea of what a saviour is supposed to display. normally, you're never supposed to believe yourself to be godlike in any way -- and definitely not "the one". the movie sidesteps this issue with prophecy, saying that if the oracle (who's really good at knowing the future) says he's the one, then he is -- but neo doesn't believe in that fate crap, so she tells him he's *not* the one, forcing him to make a life and death decision to become "the one" because he has to save morpheus.

this wasn't good enough though because he could be one of those self-declared saviours or "the (only) one" guys, so in order to make his oneness seem more of a divine sign, the oracle also prophesies to trinity that she'll fall in love with "the one" -- so because of love[^1] then that validates the oracle's prophecy -- so if you believe fate is a load of crap, you can go the neo route, and if you think that "the one" is prophesied to arrive by someone that has been around a long time and can seemingly predict the future.

either way you work it out, the movie seems to give neo a little while to finally begin to believe that he is "the one" -- and then in the last fighting scene, while the sentinels are destroying the ship, neo has to prove himself, so he stops the bullets and does a whole bunch of stuff instead of just going to the phone. I call this chuleria because he had to prove himself, now that he finally believes in himself...

after all of that effort (multiple fails -- fighting morpheus, the jump program, getting killed and trinity bringing him back to life with her belief, all (cept for tank) of the supporting characters dying, etc.) -- only then, can he finally begin to believe in himself.

---

in books like dtp and others there's this thing that comes along with power-displays, in that those that have the ability to do the power-displays shouldn't do them just to show off. the sense that I get is that all superhuman capacities (sight, hearing, producing fire, astral travel, whatever) should all be kept a secret and that you can never do this power-displays without having justification to do them.

the picture this movie paints is that "the one" can do power-displays all he wants, but everyone else has to keep their powers a secret (discression?). so it makes me wonder if in fact the reason why it's called, "the one" is because only *one* person can be doing power-displays at a time, otherwise it degenerates into a pissing contest, and that competition is really what attracts the disaster (the focus/attraction on someone else being destroyed or made inferior, which then attracts that inferiority for yourself, thinking that you physically won the 1-up game).

---

I think ego is fine. you have to know yourself and if you know that you are much more than just the physical body, that may look like "ego" to others and inspire them to try and engage in chuleria. I'm not a fan of chuleria, at all.

this movie says you should have a really hard time learning to believe in yourself, and when you do, you should engage in chuleria -- why? because you're the prophesied one.

[1]: reminds me of lidsey's dissertation on rocky in her hot takes on hercules -- because of love, yay!

### matrix 2&3 - ridiculous formula and action

I lump these two together because they feel like the same movie to me -- just nobody could stand a 4.5h movie, so they made it two. right away, they start off with a lecture on "purpose" -- and the idea is that programs have a purpose (3), while humans make their decisions irrationally based off of love (1) or emotion (5). this is once again the epic conflict between 3-7 and 5-1.

the ending was pretty disappointing to me and I thought they were going to take it a different direction because of the conversation that the counceler dude had with neo on the balcony about the symbiosis between humans and machines and that the difference is that we feel like we can "control" the stupid machines, yet the smart ones, we cannot control.

obviously, he wanted to make a point that he wasn't making a point there because again the opposite can be seen from the perspective of the machines. they like the stupid humans -- the ones that just blindly follow directions and are controlled through sensation (like the woman with the cake). the merovingian guy explains that using simple action/reaction, cause and effect, algorithms, combined with sufficient data/information/intelligence, one can can effectively control all of those sensationally driven humans. you see, the machines would look upon us in the same exact way as the counceler is speaking about the machines. the humans that are outside of their control, they will perceive as bad and/or as a threat to their continued existence.

---

the next thing is that these movies setup a triangle of forces instead of just a binary. you believe that smith is an agent, but when he combines with neo, he becomes a virus, just like he claimed the humans are. it's also revealed that smith is the dual of neo -- his opposite. therefore, he's designed, just like "the one" is to, cause imbalance in the equation, and in the process of restabilisation, change happens. the architect (3) does not like this at all.

in this triad, the oracle is chaos/intuition/desire (1), with her goal to purposefully cause an imbalance in the "perfectiion" and stability that the architect (3) tries to do inside of the equations. those two are quite good symbols and they can be represented as anatau (1) and sanatau/enki/ptah (3) pretty accurately.

when it comes to neo as a symbol, I have my objections. it is accurate that though it is a triangle, "it's not really three, but four" -- in exactly the same way that the memristor is the fourth component, he is programmable resistance. I persoally believe that the 2nd ray aspect (as well as the 4th and 6th) are designed to have a dual nature to them. I represent this with the self-sabotage paradigm, but this movie portrays it as self-sacrifice instaed.

if I had've written the story, I would have written it where neo dies, and then becomes the bad-guy (smith) that then defeats himself over and over (so far so good), but then at the end, neo needs to *assimilate* the properties of his own dual so that he becomes something bigger.

this constantly defeating the dual is the alpha and the omega (represented in the first movie with the number 303). so let's say neo is the octahedron/chestahedron. he gets fully defeated (all faces have a perpendicular vertex in the centre) and so then the dual takes over, the cube/decatria. this new form is larger than the last, but it's weakness is exactly the thing that it was fighting against, which is again its dual. this continues on endlessly, each time the dual has to reinvent itself. that constantly swapping is the repeated 5-1 vs 3-7 changing sides over and over, each time the opposite assimilating the other.

neo never assimilated smith. they just fought a long battle, and at the end smith "wins" the battle and assimilates neo again, but this time his assimilation of neo destroys the virus.

there was a level of assimilation, but it's not really shown overtly in the symbols, because neo does become machine-like in that he keeps getting up and fighting smith, and it's also shown that the oracle and also the train station girl's father shows, when he tries to behave in accordance with a word and its definition, and in the process he's willing to try and save his daughter by sending her over to the matrix from the machine world. it's also interesting too that the merovingian guy is the one that's doing trafficking from the machine world (real) into the matrix.

so what I'm saying is that it looked like the machines started to assimilate the humans capacity to believe and to make irrational decisions from emotion rather than purpose, but the humans didn't really assimilate the machines in any way. instead, they just made a peace and ended the war temporarily. in reality, if neo really was "the one" he would have accomplished his purpose of "returning to the source" and causing an upgrade for the humans both inside of the matrix and outside of the matrix by building another matrix where he makes the rules (like he said he was going to do in the first one and the train station guy did in the transition world) -- or at least he should have redesigned the train station to conform to his own rules so that matrix humans can get into the machine world the way they want to.

#### the 5-7, machine and illusory/matrix worlds

before I watch the final installment, I want to talk about the two worlds in the matrix movie. the matrix world is analgous to what we call the "physical" world (7). it's a world based on illusion, where what you see is not really real -- just electrical signals interpretted by the brain to produce an illusion of feeling. we know that different bodies respond to sensory data like pain differently, so all of that sensory data we think is real, is just a manifestation of a vibration.

that vibratory world which produces the vibration that we translate into sensation is the world I call the conceptual world. it's the "real" world in the sense that it's the source of our emotion and linear time does exist there. this "real" world is represented in the matrix by a world operated by machines. I call these "machines" conceptual programs, and I make no distinction between the "soul" or the oversoul (as seth says) of a person and another conceptual program.

what I mean is that while most people only see the illusory world of physical sensation, you also exist in the "machine world" -- the world of conceptual programs -- and that world is what most people call your "soul" or "true identity". in the matrix way of looking at it, you are just as much a machine in the machine world as agent smith or the oracle is a machine that inhabits this world (very much like the fae/fairy folk). between those worlds is the astral -- the world where the beings can make their transition between the worlds. unfortunately, the concept of death isn't explored very well in these movies. they kinda did it where neo got stuck in the astral (train) world.

[hehe, I'm get the reaction that I seem to have an interesting way of looking at stories and fluctuatons between good and bad -- and I'd totally love to give my opinion on scripts and stuff. just ask :) all ideas are free.]
