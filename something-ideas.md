### 2022-11-02 17:21 - seriah's music box

I was thinking about how I play music, which are many-hour sets of music selected by someone else, I effectively listen to recorded radio. I don't know if you remember taping the radio during disco saturday night to hopefully get a good mixtape -- but my cuts were never very good because I had to press the record and play button at the same time (why??????), so I didn't get the timing so well often. anyway, I never really *owned* that exact song but made an inferior recording of it. that's one part of it.

now consider something I noticed when reading "[fifth gospel](/steiner/fifth-gospel.md)" online, I couldn't really find the pdf[^1] and archive.org had it available. the way it works is they have an artificial limitation imposed to circumvent copyright, which is that all of the libraries registered in the index have physical copies of the book, so the number of people that can read the book simultaneously is the number of physical copies.

now, I'm thinking about seriah's music collection. he has physical copies of all of his music somewhere, but the digital is much easier to manage so he's mp3ed his collection.

so here's the idea: we recreate gatunes music player like we had it before but instead of youtube videos, we just start with seriah's music collection. other people browsing it can say they also have a physical copy (and I guess can verify it -- sorta like a collectors measuring contest).

same thing: the number of physial copies available in the network is the number of people that can play the song simultaneously.

the next thing to do is to create a blockchain sort of thing where you have a digital receipt that you "own" the physical copy of it (like a NFT), but the NFT has its own blockchain of rentals and expirey.

because the file is available, if someone wants to just play the song, they can do that, but this system is part of a larger system which is cataloguing all the music and figuring out who has the physical copies, which then these tokens can be exchanged or traded, sorta like black market art -- where the rarity is the important thing (gatta justify those large cash transfers, hehe).

[1]: so hard to search these days -- when information should be increasing, things should be increasingly easier to find cause more probability that someone has put it on the internet somewhere. I believe this is the result of people moving more and more to platforms with formatted and structured content, instead of putting their own stuff up there in more raw (or published) form.
