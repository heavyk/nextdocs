# understanding-mediums-ideas

in this document, I'm formulating ides for "understanding-mediums" which will consolidate those ideas. then, I want to condense that work further into another one. however, first things first... these are just random ideas that come to me.

### 2022-12-07 14:36 - we need to get back to the conceptual scale

this idea originally was from abramham and it has 22 layers of emotional ranges, but because they have a perceived midpoint with some as "better" than others, this was disheartening to some people because it implied that they were singular in their emotional ranges, with most people having large ... exceptions -- for certain things, people, and situations.

another way to look at the emotional scale is to no longer have a perceived "order" of greater or lesser to any one of them. you can imagine in certain zones, people and situations, certain concepts are essentially unavailable to you (I can't feel any fear around this person), and let's instead imagine clouds where certain concepts can arrive. at the very least, we'll have 22 clouds to start with, and we can give them super sales sounding names too... it'll start to become hip to make your own clouds of concepts which concepts can either positively or negatively appear (as something you fear, hate, detest, etc.) because it dosen't matter if it's positive or negative, if I'm in "I need this thing from someone", it's a potential/plausible jump to "I'll take what I can get" (as an example). those emotions don't appear on the emotional scale, so instead, we want to think of them as conceptual clouds with like tons of spinning and orbiting concepts. it's an extension to 5d. I feel inspired by lev, so take it what you will.

once we begin to look at our auras as a transmission and reception mechanism, is that it's pretty easy to see that someone on one of these mediums will create a language where people can opt-in to sending and receiving in this "feeling" language. you can imagine that it'll become very different from english and more like dance. you'll understand as we get close. from my pershpective, who cares about the encrypters, I wanna go a different route than them, and the nice thing is their encryption doesn't work without such "hostile" entities such as ourselves in their presence. we're the reason they "need" such an encryption, which means they have to maintain the system, lol... talk about not having to do anything to create a new medium. that process here, is the message.
