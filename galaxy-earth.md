### 2022-12-01 13:55 - the expanding earth

the other day when I understood the fire of prometheus, it came along with a rudimentary vision of the internal star and how it was expanding because density is rising for the star (very rapidly, as it'll continue to become similar to sirius b, emitting mostly in the higher than visible frequencies). therefore, as this density increases, because of the pyramids and other megalithic architecture, the layer we call "earth" now is tuned to a specific frequency and density. remember, before that, the earth was formless and void -- a veritable astral playground.

the "gods" designed our physical reality from their astral reality. it's very similar, but slightly different because they have like secret doors in there and stuff (these are  the "archons"). when they did that, they designed a 3d reality for us to be able to take symbolic commands from them. they live in the 4d reality, and how much "power" you have, determines how high you can go in the secret trap doors and secret hideouts.

OK, they need to have some place to hide their control mechanisms, so they're super scared of people accessing the conceptual like I do. they can't really hide anything from me cause I can just look it up, so they're caught in a crisis of everyone being able to access and perceive their secret control mechanisms. it seems that a lot of them are based on statistics, and so we need to behave "normally" (ie according to their statistics, for their modeling to work out) in that sense their "reality" is entirely built upon us behaving "normally", which means they need to control us and to steer us to keep their statistics going.

with a rapidly increasing population of much more "woke" people, their statistics and predictions aren't working out. they need to be right about it. well, thank goodness because a very rapid expansion of space is immenent. we're going to become a planet the size of a galaxy.

I had some reactions to the idea, and I think perhaps one of the better things we could eventually work toward doing is to isolate the layer, let the rock cool and then one day let it go so it starts to create its magma flows again well beyond our planet, and hopefully beyond the solar system too. I think it'd be pretty cool because that makes us the central point around which everything on the inside earth (not to be confused with the inner earth), which is now inside of this galaxy-earth that's liquid hot magma and expanding really really rapidly.

other stars in our galaxy will have to either join in or face the wrath of a lot of lava traveling really rapidly. not my problem. I bet a lot will join in. they'll all revolve around us too, which is kinda fun.

what I think is so cool about this idea is that from the outide, we're a galaxy the size of a planet. so from the universe's perspective, which we can only imagine is that of the solar but on a scale that orbiting around her are countless galaxies. we're the first "planet".

there are also tons of really cool things about it. imagine for a moment growing up and there are no other stars except for the ones in your galaxy. unable to see anything on the outside, we think we're the only ones, until we get to the edge, notice that it's solid ground, has trees and stuff on it, follow it to the top and realise one day that there is an outside.

for all intents and purposes, because the inhabitants (us) can't see the outide, we think we are the universe. we're on the inside. only some of us will know that there's a whole outside universe. a new secret to hide from some of the planets that will surely pop up and start to flourish inside of our little universe. they won't know there's an outside.
