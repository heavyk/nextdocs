### 2023-03-18 23:04 - if you're first you'll soon be last

if you're first you'll soon be last.
if you're on top, you'll soon be on bottom.

the reason for this is when looking at your basic sine wave (though many waves are much more complex), it's very very resistant to try and maintain a positive or negative voltage -- and even more difficult to maintain one that's always increasing, when thinking from the DC perspective.

so, for example, if I aim to go lower, then that's a drop, which means that later there's a rise. if I aim to go high or best, then later there's a drop. if one extends/lowers the frequency of that rise and drop to pass over a long period of time, then it's super great and then catastrophic. however, if I shorten/increase the frequency so that the rise and drops happen over a much shorter time, then it's now the centre-point of that vibration that's moving, right? but then that too has a rise and a drop to it as well. how do I stay in the centre?

I accomplish this with the inside-out perspective,
where only my orientation is adjusted,
and things are attracted to me.

imagine I look at you looking at me -- then,
we switch places -- and I'm looking at you
looking at me, where I used to be.

I'm the centre of everything; it's all relative to me.
no rising or dropping, just different perspectives of me
looking at others -- no, I mean -- me.

### 2023-03-18 23:17 - kinda abstract

I'd like to start talking more about what it
looks like in a practical sense. because, when
I'm looking at it from the centre perspective
there are always so many ahead of me
and so many behind. the're not *really* ahead
it's just my perception, I know you can't see.

so, think about this a moment: have you ever looked back at something you did in the past and said, "gah! I wish I had've known then what I know now"? anyone else that'll ever see with any condition, (great or small,) will inevitably wish they could know what their future self in their future, knows now; so really, you can comfort yourself knowing, that no matter what it is, that anyone else has, they're always going to acknowledge that it could have been better: *nobody* gets the "best" cause everything is relative to me, and there's always something better.

### 2023-04-23 22:12 - top vs bottom vs centre

in resxponse to yesterday's idea about "[the coming power structure](/the-manifestation.md#2023-04-22-1957---the-coming-power-structure)", I wote of the universal perspective in a way which perhaps some didn't understand. I'd rather to talk about it in the form of "centre perspective" here instead, as it'll be a bit clearer:
imagine for a moment that you are a star. that star starts to gain a more and more distanced relationship to the other planets in the solar system, much like a parent does with their kids: those kids grow up and become independent and eventually become their own individual entities; stars begat stars, just like adults begat adults. however, before they become adults, they start out as children.
it's not that frequently that to many things actually touch a star directly: if you've looked at sun-diving comets, most of them actually vapourise before getting close, and when they do touch, they can essentially guarantee a CME. in a way, these sorts of interactions are similar to what we could call sex, or physical interaction -- as, from my perspective, I can tell you that a star is a lot like me in the sense that they really like how *they* feel, and so because touch, inevitably means a large change in the way one feels, distance starts to emerge between the star and things around it; the further they are from the star, the more differently they feel (or hopefully so, cause proximity to different feeling/vibrating entities means a lot of chaos/eruptions/outbursts).
therefore, when I say (from the girls' perspective), "we don't want you to have the centre perspective, because then you no longer need/want us anymore" -- what they're saying there is that they feel very differently to me, and can't find a way to get close (which is a good thing).

the other angle to consider this would be from a 3rd ray perspective, where it looks like someone or something has more or less than the centre does: so, for example, let's say that there are other dudes out there that have way more cash, nice things, or access to a bunch of virgin girls. again, it's not about action, but how one feels. they have things that reflect/harmonise with how they feel, so for example the cash would be reflective of their perceived value (or how much they need others to to value them in the system), the nice things would be reflective of how much they feel they need good conditions (and how much effort they're willing to put in to getting them), and any girls (virgin or not) will be a vibrational match to how they feel, (which is pretty easy to spot if you just look at what manifestaitons they have around them) -- so in this example, they'll probably finding girls that want to feel valued, and feel like they're a good condition (like furnature) for him to have around (just like his cars and whaterver).
therefore now, the centere isn't even in that playing field. the things that are all similar feeling to the centre are nearby, meanwhile all of the things that are different are somewhere else; because the centere isn't competing on the same field (relative to how they feel), there will *always* be those with more and also with less than the centre.
to illustrate this idea, consider that the sun has more hydrogen than all of the other planets combined (and probably all floating around in the solar wind as well) -- and that's where the sun in competing. however for the heavier elements, it seems to me (though I don't know for sure) that there are other planets with more of those other elements; and, all other planets have much more organisms, and kinds of life that you don't find on the sun at all.

the centre can also be thought of as the zero: it's the closest thing to nothing (and seen as such by others), just like an argon molecule is nothing compared to another, and only interacts through electrostatic force when closeby -- even though that force is still miniscule compared to the energy contained inside of the atom. from the perspective of another argon atom at a distance, it's basically of no effect. this is because the atom itself is a very high frequency thing, so if you were to take a probe and read it, it would look like a zero, not because it doesn't have energy, but because it's vibrating too rapidly to be perceptible.
therefore, the power of the centre isn't no much in its magnitude, but in its speed. just like atoms, there are emergent properties from lower frequency parts (for a lack of terminology I'll call them attributes that behave like actors, charactor, reflectors and foils) which produce their own effects like electrostatic charge, magnetism, etc. -- and those effects are secondary, and not because of the centre itself.

the centre wants to be all by itself going tthe speed it wants to go, with other aspects (orbiting?) around it transforming that energy into something else.

### 2023-04-24 16:16 - an, aspect of Love

this morning I talked with mom about a new theory that I'm working on about jesus, YHVH, and JTB. anyway, after thinking about that, I realised that mars/ariel was (I'm going to use shakespere terminology) pined by sycorax/anatau, and so the reason for why that is not because he's some really terrible guy, but because he's looking for something outside of himself that is actually inside of him. therefore, each time he keeps going after her (sycorax), she can't let him in, because he hasn't found her inside of himself[^1].

anatau/sycorax is a -1, meaning that she captures desire and outputs more desire as she sees it ([like venus for symbol](/sledge-notes.md#2023-04-23-2252---non-physical-emitters)). what happens is that she sees things from the centre perspective -- and so to keep up the shakespere terminology here, this is chastity; she is at such a high frequency and she likes herself so much, she's not willing to give that away[^2]. she keeps becoming more and more dense and high frequency, not because of anyone else, but because she keeps seeing new and desirous things everywhere she looks. she's the essential core of the "universe" (or "all that is", God, source, etc.) and so from her perspective she doesn't want anything to do with anyone (physically) that's of a lower frequency than her.
cupid is just the same, but because he's an emitter of desire ([like jupiter does for symbol](/sledge-notes.md#2023-04-23-2252---non-physical-emitters)), his perspective is something similar to mars' in the sense that the story of him and psyche has her not really ready to be a reflection of himself -- and that, I posit is for the same reason that mars is pined by sycorax: he's looking for something outside of himself which he himself has.
notice how the depictions of cupid have him constantly shooting *other people* with his arrows? well, I don't really know if I'm more like cupid or like mars (mars, I believe) -- so for me, to explain this from mars' perspective, there's a "process" that abraham has where tthey perscribe a poor person to go around with a large sum of money in their pocket and to notice constantly the things that they can buy with that money; but, instead of buying it, just say, "I could buy that" and move on -- and the idea here is to start training yourself (mars) tto start liking the *idea* of buying something more than the actual orgasm/manifestation of the purchase itself. by doing that, they are training theirself to have the perspective of anatau/sycorax *inside of theirself*, and not to look for it outside.
cupid is the same as mars, but for a 7th ray reflector; meaning, that he thinks he's looking for the girl on the outside, but in reality she's alrady on the inside.

the reason why you want to look for these opposites, *not on the outside*, but on the inside, is because these guys are looking from the centre perspective, meaning that they're cool with everyone else having the manifestation, because "[the centre also lovves to see a reflection of their own character back to them, and so they're just seeing theirself reflected in all things](/concepts/feminine-mind.md#2023-04-20-1856---reflective-women)", which is why I believe is the real reason for cupid constantly shooting other people with arrows. inside of his mind (cause I'm a bit cupid-like myself), he's just so happy to see others doing well all the time.
if you now look at that perspective from the [point of view of the sun](#2023-04-23-2212---top-vs-bottom-vs-centre), you'll notice that all the manifestations (planets) are *outside* of the sun, and all those planets, though they feel very diffrent than the sun, cause they're so far away, which means that they're inevitably having a lot more of manifestations that the sun doesn't have -- even still, the sun is supporting and providing the reality aura in which they can create and thrive. it doesn't matter that they're misusing and squandering all of those resources that the sun gives out so freely, because it just creates more desire (which can then be turned into wanted).
you can see a mirror of the solar perspective in my own behaviour, as I find it perfectly fine that so many manifestations are being "squandered" or "misused" when in fact, I don't see it that way at all: these are just mars and cupid types that haven't realised that what they're looking for is inside of them. they may never figure it out, and that doesn't matter because I can provide infinitely more and more beautiful manifestations for them to be dissatisfied at, because they don't know they're looking for theirself. for me, it's just an excuse te keep creating newer and bigger and more awesome stuff. I don't care what they do, because with that attitude they're not getting very far anyway, and they don't hinder me any, either.

[1]: in my conversations with mom, I talked about the progression of mars from: aries, in the shadow of zeus; elijah, representative of YHVH; moses, saviour of the isrealites, etc. -- and all of this proving oneself and battling external forces, only leads mars to coming to the realisation that he's only battling a reflection of himself, and serving a master that is as "evil" as he is.

[2]: this could possibly be the original meaqning of "virgin goddess" (which obviously got distorted with the temple prostitutes) -- where she's got it going so well for herself, that she's simply not willing to give that up anymore. some dude wants to impose his perception on her, and she's like "nope! go find someone who needs to be needed" (and so then society trained virgin girls to need men, else they'd be like sycorax, pining everyone)

### 2023-05-12 08:25 - art of the foil

```
                (+) centre
               /   \
             /      \
           /         \
         /         (+/-) foil
       /           /   \

   /           /         \
 (+)--------(-/+)--------(-)
charactor   actor      reflector
```

just as having strong charactor traits makes a good actor, so too does having strong foil traits makes a good centre.
an actor takes in the energy of a charactor, transforms it to their own style (hence the reason why a good actor has for theirselves strong charactor traits), and then represents it the way that they think is a better rendering of the same concept (or mix of concepts).
a foil takes in energy from a charactor (and all of their actors) and then renders the same concept in a completely *different* way (also with the addition of their own style); so while an actor is going to output a similar result as the original charactor's concept, the foil will turn it into something entirely different.
  common usage of this is in the form of humour, where a tragic or awful situation is found by the foil to be something humorous. anther use is to to present naivaty, where the character innocently carries on, feeling as if there isn't really something awful happening. they end up taking the full brunt of the undesirable circumstances with a cheerful attitude.

I personally like to operate the foil from a cosmic perspective though, meaning that I see it from the perspective of being an eternal being -- so I play the foil in real-life much more than I've ever done for a production. simply put, what situation would normally cause most people to be in a state of dispair or depression, I still somehow manage to retain an elevated sense of confidence about myself. I rarely doubt myself.
  I suppose I doubted myself a whole lot more when I was growing up, because I was taught that we're supposed to doubt ourselves and have a low opinion of ourselves in order to fit in with the other males of the group (females do it differently, I've noticed) -- and so we need to constantly think of ourselves as less-than everyone else.
  I personally find the less-than attitude to be quite a good one, because it helps me with my own confidence: there are *always* going to be some amount of people that are better than me at any given task -- and, it's impossible for me, because my performance is so varied with my mood, impossible for me to be consistent enough to actually consider myself the "best" (or even close) at anything. there well *always* be those that are greater than me, so I simply don't try to ever be the  best; I'm always going to be less-than someone else.
I do doubt myself frequently though too -- until I'm consistent with it -- and the confidence that I have is never one that I can actually perform the way that I'm expected to (because that's impossible), because I can *never* seem to exactly satisfy anyone else's expectations for me, and neither do I ever do a perfect performance, because again my performance varies so dramatically with my mood, that it's impossible to be able to rely on anything physical for me (also, I seem to commonly have some kind of "defect" or handicap -- which I believe is on purpose).

in the perspective of life, it seems that I'm constantly putting myself into situations where I get so close to getting the material manifestation or the superior position, but then something happens and I never get it, or somehow I lose the position/money/conditions which were given to me at record rate. I attribute this to attraction, because I like the idea of accomplishing something from a limited set of resources -- like imagine, you have two films: one has a 50M budget and the other a 50K budget -- and so when the 50M movie does well in the theatres or whatever, it's not actually all that impressive -- but when the 50K film does really well (like blair witch project), it gets a million accolades for being such a game changer.
  I take a similar approach to life because I know that it's all attraction, and attraction is free; all it takes is a little bit of mental effort and a confidence in one's self.
so, what ends up happening (it appears), is that I force myself into situations which require me to become a foil -- that is receive a conceptual energy situation, and then turn that into something different than what it was.
a foil could receive situational energy from someone else and transform their good/bad situation into something worse/better (usually most foils turn a good situation worse), and so it's a really good idea to have a bunch of foils around me, to end up defeating me (which is how one gets good at the centre perspective) -- because ultimately,
the centre perspective is being a foil to everyone that contradicts my perception, and and an amplifier to everyone that matches it. I want to see everyone as a reflection of me, whether they are or not, and so that requires that I have a lot of foils around me trying to convert my perspective into something *different* (not necessarily good or bad). having others trying to constantly convince me to join their (inferior IMO) perspective, is what creates more diversity, and ultimately I'll find more reasons to update and improve upon my own perspective because of it.
  as a centre, I don't mind that others have a different perspective and even encourage it: I want to see how well it works for them, and if it works well, then I adapt (steal) it for myself.

I come up with all kinds of interesting ways to put others into manifestational situations where they're forced to decide between bad and worse manifestation -- and it's never of my own doing, but because of their own attraction (I'm just the trigger for their to receive a reflection of their own energy), therefore when it comes to these sorts of situations which I plan out for others to receive a bit of their own energy in response, I'm opening myself up in the LOA sense -- because from the foil/centre perspective, everything that I'm doing I'm actually attracting for myself as well -- therefore, the way I attract a situation for another person is to attract the same situation for myself -- because I'm a foil, and I know that should such a situation happen for me, I know I'll come out feeling fine, which means I can attract a situation that others would consider tragic/unfair/unjust, and still ceme out just fine (and if I don't, then I repeat it until I can).
in some sense of the idea, I could consider reality like a simulation, where the universe (which is really me, cause I'm centre) serves up situations to me, and I find a way to feel the way that I want about them. I like to think of it as a sort of resume of what situations I can come out of in a better situation that I went in -- and the more impossible it looks to turn such a disaster into something good, the better of a foil that I am.

I think the key to understanding how to let a tragedy happen in an energetically positive way is to perceive oneself not as a single lifetime but as a cosmic being (which may be the unconscious power of the martyr and kamakazi concepts), and that all unjustice/unfair/whatever energy can (once proper perception is attained) produce a desirable energy result -- which means that the art of the foil is just becoming better and better at transforming *all* energy into something desirable.
  a charactor emits something desirable, but a centre reflects energy as something desirable.
  everyone loves to be around a centre, because of the way they reflect: everyone looks desirable (even the bad-guys), and nobody looks like a threat
