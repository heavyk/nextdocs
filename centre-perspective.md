# centre-perspective

### 2023-03-18 23:04 - if you're first you'll soon be last

if you're first you'll soon be last.
if you're on top, you'll soon be on bottom.

the reason for this is when looking at your basic sine wave (though many waves are much more complex), it's very very resistant to try and maintain a positive or negative voltage -- and even more difficult to maintain one that's always increasing, when thinking from the DC perspective.

so, for example, if I aim to go lower, then that's a drop, which means that later there's a rise. if I aim to go high or best, then later there's a drop. if one extends/lowers the frequency of that rise and drop to pass over a long period of time, then it's super great and then catastrophic. however, if I shorten/increase the frequency so that the rise and drops happen over a much shorter time, then it's now the centre-point of that vibration that's moving, right? but then that too has a rise and a drop to it as well. how do I stay in the centre?

I accomplish this with the inside-out perspective,
where only my orientation is adjusted,
and things are attracted to me.

imagine I look at you looking at me -- then,
we switch places -- and I'm looking at you
looking at me, where I used to be.

I'm the centre of everything; it's all relative to me.
no rising or dropping, just different perspectives of me
looking at others -- no, I mean -- me.

### 2023-03-18 23:17 - kinda abstract

I'd like to start talking more about what it
looks like in a practical sense. because, when
I'm looking at it from the centre perspective
there are always so many ahead of me
and so many behind. the're not *really* ahead
it's just my perception, you see.

so, think about this a moment: have you ever looked back at something you did in the past and said, "gah! I wish I had've known then what I know now"? anyone else that'll ever see with any condition, (great or small,) will inevitably wish they could know what their future self in their future, knows now; so really, you can comfort yourself knowing, that no matter what it is, that anyone else has, they're always going to acknowledge that it could have been better: *nobody* gets the "best" cause everything is relative to me, and there's always something better.
