### 2023-03-18 23:04 - if you're first you'll soon be last

if you're first you'll soon be last.
if you're on top, you'll soon be on bottom.

the reason for this is when looking at your basic sine wave (though many waves are much more complex), it's very very resistant to try and maintain a positive or negative voltage -- and even more difficult to maintain one that's always increasing, when thinking from the DC perspective.

so, for example, if I aim to go lower, then that's a drop, which means that later there's a rise. if I aim to go high or best, then later there's a drop. if one extends/lowers the frequency of that rise and drop to pass over a long period of time, then it's super great and then catastrophic. however, if I shorten/increase the frequency so that the rise and drops happen over a much shorter time, then it's now the centre-point of that vibration that's moving, right? but then that too has a rise and a drop to it as well. how do I stay in the centre?

I accomplish this with the inside-out perspective,
where only my orientation is adjusted,
and things are attracted to me.

imagine I look at you looking at me -- then,
we switch places -- and I'm looking at you
looking at me, where I used to be.

I'm the centre of everything; it's all relative to me.
no rising or dropping, just different perspectives of me
looking at others -- no, I mean -- me.

### 2023-03-18 23:17 - kinda abstract

I'd like to start talking more about what it
looks like in a practical sense. because, when
I'm looking at it from the centre perspective
there are always so many ahead of me
and so many behind. the're not *really* ahead
it's just my perception, I know you can't see.

so, think about this a moment: have you ever looked back at something you did in the past and said, "gah! I wish I had've known then what I know now"? anyone else that'll ever see with any condition, (great or small,) will inevitably wish they could know what their future self in their future, knows now; so really, you can comfort yourself knowing, that no matter what it is, that anyone else has, they're always going to acknowledge that it could have been better: *nobody* gets the "best" cause everything is relative to me, and there's always something better.

### 2023-04-23 22:12 - top vs bottom vs centre

in resxponse to yesterday's idea about "[the coming power structure](/the-manifestation.md#2023-04-22-1957---the-coming-power-structure)", I wote of the universal perspective in a way which perhaps some didn't understand. I'd rather to talk about it in the form of "centre perspective" here instead, as it'll be a bit clearer:
imagine for a moment that you are a star. that star starts to gain a more and more distanced relationship to the other planets in the solar system, much like a parent does with their kids: those kids grow up and become independent and eventually become their own individual entities; stars begat stars, just like adults begat adults. however, before they become adults, they start out as children.
it's not that frequently that to many things actually touch a star directly: if you've looked at sun-diving comets, most of them actually vapourise before getting close, and when they do touch, they can essentially guarantee a CME. in a way, these sorts of interactions are similar to what we could call sex, or physical interaction -- as, from my perspective, I can tell you that a star is a lot like me in the sense that they really like how *they* feel, and so because touch, inevitably means a large change in the way one feels, distance starts to emerge between the star and things around it; the further they are from the star, the more differently they feel (or hopefully so, cause proximity to different feeling/vibrating entities means a lot of chaos/eruptions/outbursts).
therefore, when I say (from the girls' perspective), "we don't want you to have the centre perspective, because then you no longer need/want us anymore" -- what they're saying there is that they feel very differently to me, and can't find a way to get close (which is a good thing).

the other angle to consider this would be from a 3rd ray perspective, where it looks like someone or something has more or less than the centre does: so, for example, let's say that there are other dudes out there that have way more cash, nice things, or access to a bunch of virgin girls. again, it's not about action, but how one feels. they have things that reflect/harmonise with how they feel, so for example the cash would be reflective of their perceived value (or how much they need others to to value them in the system), the nice things would be reflective of how much they feel they need good conditions (and how much effort they're willing to put in to getting them), and any girls (virgin or not) will be a vibrational match to how they feel, (which is pretty easy to spot if you just look at what manifestaitons they have around them) -- so in this example, they'll probably finding girls that want to feel valued, and feel like they're a good condition (like furnature) for him to have around (just like his cars and whaterver).
therefore now, the centere isn't even in that playing field. the things that are all similar feeling to the centre are nearby, meanwhile all of the things that are different are somewhere else; because the centere isn't competing on the same field (relative to how they feel), there will *always* be those with more and also with less than the centre.
to illustrate this idea, consider that the sun has more hydrogen than all of the other planets combined (and probably all floating around in the solar wind as well) -- and that's where the sun in competing. however for the heavier elements, it seems to me (though I don't know for sure) that there are other planets with more of those other elements; and, all other planets have much more organisms, and kinds of life that you don't find on the sun at all.

the centre can also be thought of as the zero: it's the closest thing to nothing (and seen as such by others), just like an argon molecule is nothing compared to another, and only interacts through electrostatic force when closeby -- even though that force is still miniscule compared to the energy contained inside of the atom. from the perspective of another argon atom at a distance, it's basically of no effect. this is because the atom itself is a very high frequency thing, so if you were to take a probe and read it, it would look like a zero, not because it doesn't have energy, but because it's vibrating too rapidly to be perceptible.
therefore, the power of the centre isn't no much in its magnitude, but in its speed. just like atoms, there are emergent properties from lower frequency parts (for a lack of terminology I'll call them attributes that behave like actors, charactor, reflectors and foils) which produce their own effects like electrostatic charge, magnetism, etc. -- and those effects are secondary, and not because of the centre itself.

the centre wants to be all by itself going tthe speed it wants to go, with other aspects (orbiting?) around it transforming that energy into something else.
