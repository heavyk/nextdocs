### 2022-09-18 01:39 - one thing I really like

OK, so I just wanted to talk for a moment about how intriguing it is for there to be two girls from a totally foreign culture (to me at least), and they both have the same birthdates as kenny and anatau. it's going to be so weird interacting with me in opposite gender and foreign culture/ideas[^1], because I'm certain they'll be like mirrors and I'll see myself in reflection.

it seems maybe almost like a cheat code. you know, I don't really take any images of myself or look at myself on camera much, so I don't really have a self-image (I probably do, just don't remember it because I can't see it) so I would be seeing myself through them.

this whole idea fascinates me deeply.

[1]: you know this remided me a lot of when I was in spain and I learned tons about my left-side just by watching andrea. I noticed my left-side behaved like she did ([in the sense of desire](/know-thyself.md#1st-ray)). very fascinating because I think my left-side is rigt-handed. I remember raquel was like that too (her left-side is right-handed too). andrea gave me a reference point to begin understanding the 1st ray (desire) and how to effectively manage it. these two are totally different because instead of it being a 1st or 7th ray approach, this is more the cultural/logical way of approaching something. it's totally different and I see where it's going, because I bet they're both right-handed too.

### 2022-09-18 01:57 - so what I was thinking

is that I would really like to meet them alone so that I can get better vibrational contrasts between them. you know, like if you can control the signal at the source, you can infer spectrum changes and frequency shifts easier. this should be delayed obviously for a while. just saying because I was sitting there deeply impressed at how interesting this idea is.

you see, I don't get a lot of opportunity to analyse other people. all of the interactions I have are mostly a false persona, so I don't really observe anyone behaving naturally. I notice that it takes some days until we're behaving naturally together, but it's not too long. once then, I can simply pay attention to everything they're doing, and I don't have to worry about negative reactions about what is he looking at (well, who knows if that'll still happen), but it is still really interesting to me mostly just to watch -- but not with my eyes, of course (I perceive very little with my eyes or ears now; I'm proportionally very blind and deaf). it only takes me a little bit to deconstruct somebody's personality now, so it shouldn't be too long.

### 2022-09-18 02:29 - I suppose it's a bit of a compromise

but, what if amorina could come along as well. then, because of the similarities between me and amorina, it'll be easier for them to see differences and similarities between us.

I put the title on purpose.
