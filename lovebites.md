### 2022-09-18 01:39 - one thing I really like

OK, so I just wanted to talk for a moment about how intriguing it is for there to be two girls from a totally foreign culture (to me at least), and they both have the same birthdates as kenny and anatau. it's going to be so weird interacting with me in opposite gender and foreign culture/ideas[^1], because I'm certain they'll be like mirrors and I'll see myself in reflection.

it seems maybe almost like a cheat code. you know, I don't really take any images of myself or look at myself on camera much, so I don't really have a self-image (I probably do, just don't remember it because I can't see it) so I would be seeing myself through them.

this whole idea fascinates me deeply.

[1]: you know this remided me a lot of when I was in spain and I learned tons about my left-side just by watching andrea. I noticed my left-side behaved like she did ([in the sense of desire](/know-thyself.md#1st-ray)). very fascinating because I think my left-side is rigt-handed. I remember raquel was like that too (her left-side is right-handed too). andrea gave me a reference point to begin understanding the 1st ray (desire) and how to effectively manage it. these two are totally different because instead of it being a 1st or 7th ray approach, this is more the cultural/logical way of approaching something. it's totally different and I see where it's going, because I bet they're both right-handed too.

### 2022-09-18 01:57 - so what I was thinking

is that I would really like to meet them alone so that I can get better vibrational contrasts between them. you know, like if you can control the signal at the source, you can infer spectrum changes and frequency shifts easier. this should be delayed obviously for a while. just saying because I was sitting there deeply impressed at how interesting this idea is.

you see, I don't get a lot of opportunity to analyse other people. all of the interactions I have are mostly a false persona, so I don't really observe anyone behaving naturally. I notice that it takes some days until we're behaving naturally together, but it's not too long. once then, I can simply pay attention to everything they're doing, and I don't have to worry about negative reactions about what is he looking at (well, who knows if that'll still happen), but it is still really interesting to me mostly just to watch -- but not with my eyes, of course (I perceive very little with my eyes or ears now; I'm proportionally very blind and deaf). it only takes me a little bit to deconstruct somebody's personality now, so it shouldn't be too long.

### 2022-09-18 02:29 - I suppose it's a bit of a compromise

but, what if amorina could come along as well. then, because of the similarities between me and amorina, it'll be easier for them to see differences and similarities between us.

I put the title on purpose.

#### 2022-09-18 02:31 - why?

because if the manifestation is good, it won't happen. it's the technique of turning the wanted stuff into unwanted manifestations (it's kinda a mental trick you get used to). so, I just try and see everything from the worst possible manifestation, and then I try and find the things I like about the manifestation because I know it won't be. as soon as I find things that I like about the manifestation[^2] or find things that I don't like, then the manifestation transformation-of-desire. each transformation-of-desire, the desire becomes more and more what perspective it is I want *myself*, and that means that at some point in time when I'm able to finally line up with that desire, I AM the thing that I thought I wanted. therefore, transform it af, until it's guaranteed to be the worst possible manifestation -- which is that I AM the thing I was looking for.

this really is the ultimate "battle" that is happening, which is that I like to keep things on the WPM for nearly 100% of the time (especially the case for action-kenny). I need to find a way to caducar nice ideas as quickly as possible. the faster I do that, the faster they evolve to the final goal is me realising that is my own desire, not something external to me. see the conflict, of where is the desire coming from?

[2]: this is good for combating nosebook's unbelievably detailed renderings of pretty awful manifestations. I just find the things I like about even the most awful and nosebook has to alter their strategy because they want to make sure that my manifestation is the absolutely most unwanted manifestation (in their perspective).
