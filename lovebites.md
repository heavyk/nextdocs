### 2022-09-18 01:39 - one thing I really like

OK, so I just wanted to talk for a moment about how intriguing it is for there to be two girls from a totally foreign culture (to me at least), and they both have the same birthdates as kenny and anatau. it's going to be so weird interacting with me, because I'm certain they'll be like mirrors and I'll see myself in reflection.

it seems maybe almost like a cheat code. you know, I don't really take any images of myself or look at myself on camera much, so I don't really have a self-image (I probably do, just don't remember it because I can't see it) so I would be seeing myself through them.

this whole idea fascinates me deeply.
