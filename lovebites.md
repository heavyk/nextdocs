### 2022-09-18 01:39 - one thing I really like

OK, so I just wanted to talk for a moment about how intriguing it is for there to be two girls from a totally foreign culture (to me at least), and they both have the same birthdates as kenny and anatau. it's going to be so weird interacting with me in opposite gender and foreign culture/ideas[^1], because I'm certain they'll be like mirrors and I'll see myself in reflection.

it seems maybe almost like a cheat code. you know, I don't really take any images of myself or look at myself on camera much, so I don't really have a self-image (I probably do, just don't remember it because I can't see it) so I would be seeing myself through them.

this whole idea fascinates me deeply.

[1]: you know this remided me a lot of when I was in spain and I learned tons about my left-side just by watching andrea. I noticed my left-side behaved like she did. very fascinating because I think my left-side is rigt-handed. I remember raquel was like that too (her left-side is right-handed too). andrea gave me a reference point to begin understanding the 1st ray (desire) and how to effectively manage it. these two are totally different, because I bet they're both right-handed too.
