### 2023-02-14 08:40 - mary kate and ashley's school dance

yesterday, when walking home, I noticed a book on the ground with the title:

```
you're invited to

Mary Kate & Ashley's

SCHOOL DANCE
```

I thought it was quite an interesting title because I noticed that they were quite young in the picture -- and honestly, it reminded me of their ages in "full house" where they were featured, not as girls that went to school, but the house-bound foils always there to give snarky commentary to one of the struggling males like jesse.

at any rate, the next thing that I noticed was that the book gives off this vibe like a school dance is some romantic thing where you can finally get to interact with your crush -- which is a very different mental mindset from what I would consider a school dance to be like.

I've never gone to a school dance, and if we even had one when I was in school, I most certainly wouldn't have gone because we were still pretty religious at the time, and I remember girls being pretty off-limits -- so, I don't really know what they're like from experience.

the closest thing I have to experience of a school dance is watching various comedies and such on TV of school dances, and so I have associated with them tremendous discomfort and this idea that some guys are out there and they can dance and stuff, but then the guys that don't know how to dance just stand there with their backs to the wall and watch others dance ("get your backs up off the wall").

---

related to this idea, I've been going through the tim's summary of the books of the illiad, and one common theme in the book is how girls just lead to such tremendous problems: there's hellen eloping with a pretty-boy poser, paris; agamemnon and achilles fighting over some girls that they captured after plundering a city, the daughters of zeus, where -- something about if you don't heed them, bad things happen (which I guess is why you have to evoke the muses).

at any rate, these themes setup a sort of narrative way for reality to unfold just as the teen comedies of my day caused me to expect that school dances would be full of awkward moments and a recognition of a boy's inability to perform (unless he's really cool like travolta in grease or something) -- so, in the iliad, girls tend to come to expect that men will fight over them, and they'll be the cause for all this needless war, destruction, and loss of life[^1]. they're furnature that get offered as gifts or a reward to the major heros that are out there doing all the *real* work of slaughter (like hector).

so, here's this book, laying on the ground with these two girls on the front, which I'm not good at judging ages, but I don't think they were more than like 6-9yo, giving a strong vibe to me like the school dance is this place where you (the reader) can make your dreams come true at mary kate and ashley's school dance.

the first thing that popped into my head on that is extreme doubt of such a reality because afterall, I've come to expect awkward situations, embarrassment, and a confrontation of one's own inability to perform to match these unbelievable expectations created by these sorts of books and movies...

however, the next thing that popped into my head was the realisation that I made a long time ago regarding a similar thing. I'd watched a lot of adam sandler movies (and other similar things), where the general idea is that women are impossible to understand, and the closest he can get to a girl is when she doesn't remember him from day to day (so no bad deeds can accumulate enough for her to realise he's not all that great); and, this is kinda the perspective I had as well for all of my teenage years. sometime in spain (after raquel, because she kept saying I wasn't empathetic), I noticed that I didn't really have all that much difficulty understanding them -- and in fact, I *can* understand them pretty well, but I don't understand why they would consistently pick retards to go home with (now, I know it's because of these authorized-realities).

after learning LOA and beginning to pay attention to my emotions, I'd kinda proven to myself that I *am* empathetic and I do actually get what they're saying because it's all emotional stuff and they, like me, had been struggling to actually get out the *emotion* into understandable conceptual form. I noticed that girls (notably raquel) had been being taught to look at and try to affect *hechos* as a symbol of their desire (romance), instead of trying to affect their own emotion or the emotion of the person they're trying to talk to. at some point, I finally just had to give up the idea that I didn't understand them, cause I did -- and I finally could see through the adam sandler haze and realise that it was actually *men* that I didn't understand.

I made a joke about this yesterday saying [that girls dance around the subject, meanwhile men make points](/sepehr-thoughts.md#2023-02-13-0818---circle-and-dot). sure, men make points too, but in spain, men (like my father) dance endlessly around the subject, never actually speaking clearly, meanwhile women will have lengthy lengthy discussions only making points (salvame (deluxe), for example). what's also interesting about this joke is that for gay couples, I've noticed that it's the "top" that tends to make a lot of points, meanwhile, it's the bottom that struggles to express theirself emotionally, tending to get stuck in the endless indirect conversation filled with euphamisms and such (kinda like the woman I met yesterday looking for some "change" 12 cents worth -- to which I gave her 23 cents and told her if I find out where her son is, she'll "get my message").

---

in conclusion to this (but not really a social commentary), I'd like to mention that it has been the authorized-reality for females that they are circles, and men are dots, but I find that we're both attractive and expansive at one time. we have both, and so one of the things I was thinking about is, how could a school dance actually be, not what the authorized-reality says it'll be.

[1]: the book is very ironic, so painting women, givers of life, instead as the reason for tremendous loss of life just adds to the number of ironic things present in this epic tale of men trying to prove theirselves.
