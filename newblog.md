starting over again

### 2021-09-08 11:05 - effortless power

for a few days (weeks?) now I have been taking a break from this since my laptop crashed. I listend to a number of snake-bros episodes and also managed to watch almost all of electtroBOOM's videos too. as a result, I have a number of topics that I want to talk about. I'm going to get to them one by one here, litle by little.

---

the first thing I want to talk about is the idea of effortless power and next logical step. a few days ago, I was out watching stars when I had a major realisation of why mr. motor does not feel capable of going toward somethting that feels like something he wants. it's a crazy self-reinforcing feedback loop.

so, imagine that a sales person comes to you and makes a load of crap sound good and manages to dupe you... you purchase this product thinking it'll fulfil your expectations, only to find out that it falls very short and they just made it sound good to take advantage of you for their own personal gain.

I could perceive that this happened to mr. motor quite a bit. that was actually a surprise to me because I would have imagined that he would recognise snake oil salesmen and not fall for his own crap.

I thought about it for a while and it makes sense that is what he experiences because that's where he's focused. his desire to take advantage of other people is actually *attracting* others that are attempting to do the same to him, too.

that was a huge revelation for me, though looking back now it seems quite obvious. a person will attract others around him/her that feel similarly to how they feel. that means that fraudsters will be surrounded by other fraudsters. it kinda makes sense now why so many of these ancient power structures were the way they were. if the guy in power got there by manipulating his way to the top, he would be surrounded by a bunch of others trying to angle their way to the top, too.

---

therefore because mr. motor only finds other people like himself trying to take advantge of him every time he tries to go toward something that will allow him to feel a way that he wants to feel (this likely includes women too), he is met with people just like himself (perfect matches to the way he feels himself).

so, because constant fraud and exploitation manifests every time that mr. motor tries to go toward wanted, he concludes that he does not want to ever try and go toward the way he wants to feel, and just try and minimise the effects of things causing him to feel they way he doesn't want to feel.

obviously this isn't possible, so he's only attracting more of what he doesn't want to feel further.

---

as a result, it became clear to me that instead of making decisions based on "next logical step" (going toward a desirable feeling) he instead has replaced this with "no other option" system of action. this means that all actions can taken so long as they're justified because there is "no (perceived) other option" of action that can be taken.

---

as a result, I have been thinking a lot more about this concept of "next logical step" again since this revelation. in the past, I have called it by different names such as "getting into the centre" and "no big jumps" -- but the idea is the same of not taking any intention to try and make anything to happen. instead, I just understand that my desire is already known by my non-physical self and so therefore all I have to do is to just keep pointing in the direction of feelinbg better.

so, as things come to me, I'm just reacting to the intentions of others, not having any of my own. I remain relaxed and it appears to others on the outside that I'm reading the opponent's mind and countering their every move. I often get the reaction that I'm always one step ahead, so that falls into the expectation there.

I then heard about this martial arts technique called "effortless power"[^1] and I realised that fighting technique is the same thing as this idea of keeping in the centre or no big jumps. I make no effort to do anything -- instead from my perspective it feels like I'm dancing with them. they put in all of the intention and I just transform the energy they're putting into the system into something that feels like I'm going toward something desired.

in fact this whole mars and earth idea is exactly the application of this principal on a planetary scale. the major difference is that there is no battle, so there are no losers. I/we provide the feeling that they want to feel, and they put in the energetic intention of what they want accomplish, and we turn it into something that is wanted.

I'm getting the impression while writing this that this is what the mitochondria does for the nuclear DNA and is the holy grail (11:55) that so many have been searching for. interesting. so, in that format, earth is the  mitochondria and mars is the nuclear? I'll have to think more on that... I don't know much about this stuff. the science papers are somewhat difficult for me to understand. I need a randall carlson of genetics I can ask a million questions :)

---

getting back on track here... I realised that this whole thing will become more and more effortless as time goes on, as I believe these principals are quite easy... in fact, they're effortless. there's literally nothing to be done. the greatest hurdle is convincing yourself that the majority of you is not present in your physical body and that it takes *minimal* effort to "get into the zone"[^2].

speaking of getting into the zone, I believe there are various levels of this zone that people experience mere one is sense of communinion with somone else or another part of you that guides you through the obstacles, all the way to literally perceiving yourself conceptually -- that is peering in from the perspctive of your "higher self" or source -- allowing you to be able to perceive yourself in any way enabling shape-shifting and flight too.

so there are varying degrees to the manifestation of this zone. I definitely feel like I'm there pretty much all of the time now, thougb I don't have the manifested conditions of it yet. I consider this to be a good thing. I like the way I'm going and I don't want the zone to feel like it's anything other than normal experience. I want my normal experience to be this zone.

so, you could sort of say that I'm applying the effortless power principals to the attainment of effortless power. it shouldn't feel different. it should feel normal and effortless, just like how effortless beating my heart feels.

---

you may have noticed that I've been doing things like peacing out of watchingt stars right at the peak of the experience -- right before the breakthrough into the next (big) vision upgrade. it's part of making all of this feel as effortless as possible. there's no need for big jumps. my desire is already known and it's all coming out effortlessly like a dance.

[1]: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/UMF3SJ5Cunk?t=4789)

[2]: this was another concept covered in @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdfXxsdAqSM), where people can make impossibly rapid decisions whey they get into the zone and are connected to that higher self. they can just manouver around different obstcacles effortlessly. interestingly, this is kinda the way that marty described hitler in the latest episode, too: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4I6A4oFZoQ).

### 2021-09-08 12:43 - more on effortless power

most people think that they need to try and motor their way toward getting effortless power as quickly as possible. russ explained how people do base jumping to force this zone experience, because your body feels it's going to die if it doesn't force a change in perception.

it's good to practise it, but the reason why the state doesn't last is because the body does not feel that is its natural state. to be in that state should be effortless. this is why I don't want to try and motor my way toward this with the stars. it'll become so normal, the transition into this state will feel so effortless that I wouldn't really perceive it as a change.

this is my goal: to make the aquisition of that state feel itself effortless.

---

as you go through life, you are bombarded with a million signals which tell you what to think. kyle used the example of even the realisation of how much goes into processing the meaning the stop light imposes on the person when coming to the intersection.

the reason why I started the discussion by explaining the "no other option" vs "next logical step" form of perception is because they appear similar by the are built on entirely different foundations of perception.

he explained that all of this comes to meaning that we associate to the thing we are analysing. some people perceive the stop light in a way of "if I don't stop, I'll get run over" -- because that's unwanted, it appears like the only available option is to stop for the light.

however, another very valid perception is that stopping at the stoplight is just the next step in progress toward the destination. the viewpoint is chosen by the person. is the stop light an inconvenient necessity to ensure safety, or just a sort of rhythmic advance toward the destination.

in the sense that the stoplight is no longer perceived anymore, it no longer takes any importance and so therefore no longer has any more implied meaning of inconvenience or whatever, it seems to fade into the background of the experience, much like the musican is no longer focused on the other noises in the room, or the base jumper no longer perceives any of the danger. it loses its consequence (meaning).

---

I'm going to have to try and think of more ways to express this concept -- but it feels efforless. there's nothing to avoid. it's like being on a train. get up and walk around the cabin, drink some gts and have fun and arrive to the location without any effort.

it's a state of mind that we lose when we begin to give so many things outside of ourselves importance. going back to ep 11, this is what they were talking about when decending from this spiritual (I call it conceptual) perception, and into the nitty gritty physical and all of its implications.

it's all about emotional control. negative emotion pulls you right back into the physical world, so to remain relaxed and conscious of your conceptual perception of yourself, all the negative emotion producing stuff (even things like death and tragedy) should no longer have a meaning which gives them more importance than your conceptal version of yourself -- who you *really* are -- who you know yourself to be (in any circumstances).

---

all of us will eventually accomplish this; it's inevitable. you can try your hardest to avoid this realisation for as long as possible, but eventually, if you want to continue to survive (that is that all paths lead to self-destruction), there will be no other option than to change the perception of the conditions.

one can continue to try and adjust the conditions to keep the manifestation of how one feels (about where they're focused) from manifeshting -- for a while, but eventually it does manifest (that's why it's effortless). or, said from the opposite perspective: someone can try to avoid things which will cause them to feel ways they don't want to feel, but it only makes a manifestation which will cause them to feel the way they don't want to feel more and more effortless.

eventually, one is faced with a predicament where the only option remaining is to change the perecption (implications) of their conditions, because the conditions are so inevitable.

the problem is the solution.

### 2021-09-08 21:46 - pushing back the timeline

the reactions to the last entry were kind of interesting. I hadn't written in a while and I would say the response was more negative than positive. that's good though. that's why I'm writing again. interestingly, the weridest response was something like,"we liked you better when you weren't writing" -- and I think that's often the case when the guy who doesn't say anything is more attractive than the one shooting his mouth off.

thing is, I'm not really writing for anyone else's benefit than my own. when I write here, nosebook gets a good insight into my thought and gives them a much larger surface area to push against. if I don't say much, I imagine that the broadcasts are less frequent and it's easier to angle the centent to be more pleasing to the viewer, makingg the overall response a better one.

I think they have to do a little more work to turn text into something presentable to the audience as well[^1]

so with having to do more work to this text, a considerable amount of thought goes into trying to figure out what I'm trying to say here which greatly distorts the concepts. when I return back to the concepts -- most notably the effortless power one -- they are greatly distorted with people's perception of the same concept. the concept is usually badly damaged and I essentially have to rediscover it again. nosebook occasionally exerts effort to try and ensure I don't remember it that way too also forcing me to have to rediscover it. each time I rediscover it though, I get the concept stronger.

as a perfect example of this, one of the reactions was that my rendering of the limitless power concept was different and my rendering kinda "wrecked" the concept they previously had of it. this is precisely what I mean when I say I have to rediscover it and it comes back even stronger. this is the intended result, so I'm glad I can have return the favour.

---

the other thing I was noticing is that I have to kind of spell things out a bit more too in writing. when my thoughts get transfered, it feels to me like everyone feels they understand them -- and I think that's only because the concept is transferred. each person interprets the concept within the framework of their own perception and everyone feels like they get it -- cause they do. however, if we were to all to have to explain what that concept meant to you, upon writing it down, you may find that in the translation of the concept into words, it may no longer appear like you understand the concept as well as you think you do[^2]. in fact, I have found it to be very helpful to force myself to translate the concept (ideal) into physical. so, it may be helpful to keep a journal or write out any of any highly conceptual ideas to try and force their rebirth.

---

so, for example, I wrote about how all of this was becoming effortless and I wrote about how I was purposefully stopping to watch stars just before I got to the peak. I'm no longer interested in trying to make a breakthrough. I'm convinced I can do that pretty easily at this point. instead, now I want it to become such a part of me that it's no longer considered a big thing anymore. it's as easy as beating my heart to breathing. automatic, but I can take control of it if I wish to.

I also don't want to really try and make any strong intentions anymore either. I used to call becoming resistance-free, as it's easy to just go in the direction of what I want to feel like feels like.

as a result, it's my intention to push the timeline back as far as I can. I know what I want, and I'm in the process of making it. let's talk about that now so they can push against it.

---

you see, this whole thing I want to creatce is really starting to take shape. I'll write about it again, but after watching the "god of wine" episode (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDOA9-ANgQ)), I wrote out the symbols in the dionysus presentation as being a progression of zodiac signs, and then surmised that they were similar to the progression of symbols for the epic of gilgamesh and enkidu -- with the proposed idea that both dionysus and enkidu are symbolic attractors for the human race at the "end of time". I then decided to write what I thought would be the next symbols I thought would come for dionysus as we continue the progression (cause his symbols end in aries/picsis). so I did. this was unfortunately lost in the hard disk crash though...

I wanted to listen to the epic of gilgamesh episode (@[youtube](zhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYhrrXqwVMc)), and the symbols for enkidu and gilgamesh I noticed followed pretty similarly the symbols I proposed. unfortunately, I can't remember them now. I'll make a new version of that story soon.

also, in my version they got thrown into a furnace afterward. this was a life threatening symbol of destruction which two twins come to help them out of the furnace, but one perishes (obviously the mortal one) and they climb up and gain winges of an eagle and fly up. for gilgamesh, the transition from gemini to scorpio is shown as twin scorpions at the end of the solar race. this corresponsds to the "impossible task" I have made reference to.

very intersting that the symbols corresponded so closely. I said all of that to say that my intuition said that the next phase for dionysus/enkidu (these are the immortal and mortal twins) and gilgamesh (the spoiled douchbags that came from mars/nibiru to earth to be befriend their own creation, enkidu), is to traverse `leo -> gemini` before ascening up to `scorpion/eagle -> virgo` before then finally making it to aquarius again.

---

so, there was a conflict there because I perceived that as the trajectory, I wanted to do this mars thing -- which perhaps would mean there will be no flip. however, yesterday(?) I had a small monologue in my head about the new way I'm seeing it now. the plan feels really good to me and is what I want to do now.

you see, no one has be be on-board with me on this at all. in fact, everyone that wants to go their own way, I think that's a great idea. there are two aspects to this. first, whenever I want to do something, nosebook has to find a way to sabotage the idea. however, I don't think the idea goes nowhere. I think they perhaps have to do it, then we have to come back and sabotage it or something like that. I don't know how it works, but they have to do something so abort my intentions and go a different way.

this is the thing. I don't want to do something different than what they want to do. there is a lot of desire for a cataclysm/nova or whatever, and I want that now too. there's no fighting. I'm going to go the motor-way. for reals this time. he will make all of the intention and I'll just relax and go with the flow. he/they will do all of the effort for me in attempt to go the way they want to go -- which is the way I want to go now too.

I just need to give a little starting velocity and they can take it from there. by avoiding to get into the zone, and make that state become effortless to me, then I don't have to do anything. I make no intention so there's nothing to counter.

imagine for a moment that we look at the effortless power from their perspective now. the idea is that he has so far removed the meaning associated with the concepts that he perceives at a much faster rate than a normal human. like the base jumper, there isn't enough time to physically make the action, so there's another entity (your source) that's out there really far ahead and giving intuitive knowing of what is to be done[^3]

so, from nosebook's perspective, they have this form of perception. they are way far out ahead of me in the physical world. they perceive me intentions far before even I am aware of them. this makes conversation on taboo subjucts annoying from my perspective, because they already know what I want to say and are interrupting me or manipulating the conversation around it[^4].

in their perspective, they have effortless power to fight me being so far out ahead of me, perceiving my intentions.

so, going back to creating what I want, like the base jumper who continues to feel good even when life-threatening things are wizzing past, reality must conform to the guy in the zone, then I don't need to have any intentions. I just need to feel the way I want to feel. I remove all of the meaning associated with the concepts around me and naturally reality conforms to the way I feel.

from their perspective, they are completely incapable of directing if I don't have any intentions. this is why it's so important for them that I write these down, because it illuminates my intentions more clearly for them.

---

I know that if I wanted to manifest what I want, then I would just stop writing and talking about what I want. instead, I've chosen to continue on showing my intention so they can keep fighting against it.

you'll notice that I have used both analgies of the effortless power simultaneously. they have very good capacity to predict my intentions -- and this is the point. this is mars job: to try and control all of the steff that we want to do and to try and limit them. it's earth's job to feel good anyway and transform that feeling of unwanted they're projecting into a feeling of allowing of something that feels wanted. we'll never get to feel that "in the zone" feeling that they have allowing them to predict intentions at high frequency. instead, we just feel good -- and by feeling that way we continue to have more and more nice things manifest.

they'll never be big things. instead, they'll be things they feel they have no other option than to allow.

I believe this is how DNA works :)

[1]: wierd self-realisation / self-reference reactions there... that's what I'm saying: I just write and I don't really think about how you guys will read it. it was weird to feel that reaction because I don't know what this gets turned into so it was weird to feel you guys thinking about what I speculate this gets turned into -- inception :)

[2]: case in point, after a psychedellic experience or a good stone, try to explain to someone or write down what the experience meant to you -- that is, present the concepts and explain their meaning.

[3]: even if heading straight toward an object, if that does not cause a feeling of panic, but instead the person maintains feeling good, then no death will occur. reality must conform to the feeling that the base jumper has in the moment, so a way around (or through) the obstacle is provided. 3d reality must conform to the vibration of the consciousness in which it's focused.

[4]: a good example of this is the conversation with matthew about the nofap. I wanted to talk about how sex with another person has a reciprocating effect, but when you're by yourself, that energy is lost. I was interrupted and we moved forward in the conversation.

### 2021-09-09 21:32 - what I want to create

I was so busy last time talking about all of the aspects around how I want them to try and push against what I want to create, that I forgot to actually write it out.

---

thinking about the whole thing about how intuitively I think we should be taking a trip through leo, delaying the trip to aquarius by another 12ky, and I think my plan should incorporate that.

a while ago I presented an idea where we could cause a planet to begin to form inside of the sun by putting a 3d signal into the sun and the elements that would normally coalesce in the intercalate regions would begin to form into a structure which will eventally be ejected as a planet.

I liked that idea. there are a lot of unknowns about it but, I think it would be cool to make an asymmetric planet based on 5. it would push mercury into the 2nd position and venus into the 3rd. we would then join mars in the 4th position.

if my theory of counter-rotating fields emanating radially from the sun is correct, then the 4th position rotates opposite direction from the one we're in now. rotating in the opposite direction, we would indeed see leo rising with the sun on the spring equinox, so it fulfills that requirement.

---

quick tangent: I was thinking about it, and the myth of osiris being reborn (or whatever amazing return of a golden age or whatever) must be a prophecy that has been around for a while, yet in my estimation it has likely been quite elusive.

the reason for this, is because the guaranteed flips are at the end(?)[^1] of gemini and the beginning of scorpio. however the reversals I believe are induced by LOA and happen as a result of a split. what I mean is, the time of the reversal, I'm fairly certain is variable and therefore could happen earlier or later, and even potentially more than once each 12ky cycle.

so, imagine for a moment how chaotic things could get if this starts to happen say every few hundred years. however, let's assume that it takes roughly ~6ky to build up to a split. imagine we're in the `scorpio -> virgo` phase, but sirius' effects are still too beneficial and enough division between the physical and conceptual hasn't taken place yet that there isn't enough energy for a split. we keep going into leo and finally enough energy builds to split. we reverse and find ourselves in capricorn -- yet once again missing aquarius.

kinda an interesting thing to think about the effects of over/under-shooting the reversal.

---

ok, back on track here... I wanted to write more about what I wanted to create so that nosebook can fight it, but I don't feel it so much anymore.

also, I just realised I made a mistake too. I mixed two concepts. if we were out in the 4th with mars while turning in reverse direction, then we would be going the same as now. man, I dunno anymore. I felt like I had a solution there... I can't figure out the maths... maybe we flip over. I dunno. I just know that I don't have to worry about it. there are way smarter people capable of making the implementation happen. I just desire and let someone else worry about creating its physical form.

I'm gonna end it here. until next time :~)

[1]: it occurred to me that flip point may actually precess as well; evidence of an even bigger cycle

### 2021-09-10 03:36 - my take on the ufo phenomena

been listening to the ufo stuff with marty garza on snake-bros and I noticed a lot of things that seemed relatively easy to understand. I am writing this as if I am talking to marty directly.

I want to present a coherent idea here with some obvious flaws in it. I am rather new to both the snake-bros and the ufo phenomena in general. I always considered it to be a total load of crap. it feels of fear to me, and all one needs to do to experience the alien is to drop a high dosage of mushrooms. interestingly enough, dmt and after listening to the episodes, I'm convinced that one's (emotional/conceptual/spiritual) sensitivity plays a huge role in the framework through which these are perceived.

#### law of attraction (LOA)

I also believe that an understanding of how the "law of attraction" and resonance operates is fundamental to understand this as well. a good example of this is tesla's "earthquake machine" or just pushing someone on a swingset also illustrates this quite well.

if you push the swing at the proper time, a small amount of energy (like a suggestion or a doubt) can eventually build up to have quite a lot of energy. I call this using well timed (minimal) effort to one's advantage instead of massive quantities of energy. because the process takes a lot of time to accumulate acceleration, it can be stopped a lot easier than something with a lot of inertia as well. for example, it's a lot easier (and a lot more time) to turn off tesla's earthquake machine, than to stop a wrecking ball heading toward a building. both destroy the building if no action is taken, but only one can be easily stopped once set into motion.

#### the unlikely case that it's alien species

tracking how fast the human species is advancing technologically, I am certain that there are alien species here on the planet right now. however, they're so far ahead of us, we simply are incapable of perceivcing them. in fact, I even propose that stars and planets are conscious; we simply don't have a very reliable (yet) means of communication with them. I also contend that although we perceive through the body, the body is a collection of a lot of other conscious cells and also organs. you are the super-conscious perception of all of those cells. likewise the same is true for stars, planets, and galaxies.

therefore, if you were to look at human development from the perspective of a galaxy, we (our planet/solar system) are going from zero to a competent component of the galaxy in a relative instant. from that perspective, it would appear like a DC pulse or a square-wave, the acceleration is so rapid.

therefore, I find it highly unlikely that we would ever encounter a species with technology similar to our own. they will still be primitive or much more advanced than us.

I must therefore conclude that the ufo phenomena is actually of human origin and not alien.

#### the root race custodians

I propose that when blavatski talks about the "root races", I believe she infers that each new root race is selected right after the cataclysm (so every 12ky), and it's chosen based on who can create the most oppressive "heierarchy". previously it was the atlanteans, then it was the aryans. I couldn't find her talking about the prior ones so if you know, I'd be intested to find out who those were.

#### why do we have custodians?

the reason for this, I believe is easily explained with LOA: a simplified example is this, but it's more like tuning .. so if you can think in harmonics and octaves, then it's more like that. however, for now we'll approach this concept spatially. when a signal emanates outward from it's source, it has an amplitude. let's say it goes 100 units away from it's source toward a desired destination (think a pendulum, guitar string, a swing, or ac electricity). however, because all things are vibrating, or emanating from the zero point, it then has to travel back to it's source. it then has to return back 100 units. this is when it's moving it's fastest, and it keeps going -- but this time 100 units backward *away* from the desired destination: the sine wave.

now comes perception. it is impossible to perceive anything in its entirety from inside of itself. to perceive something, it needs to have some distance from itself to get a perspective. this distance inevitably means that some part of it is no longer percievable (like the opposite side of the moon) from the angle of pertception.

in the case of the moon, we see nearly 50% of it. however, when it comes to our perceptive range, we perceive a very narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum, and of that we only get a tiny glimpse of the signal. let's say for example that we perceive only 10%. now, imagine your sine wave and pick any 10% section of the sine wave and describe it as how fast is it accelerating toward the desired destination or away from it.

therfore, the most desired is also the most undesirable too -- and it's up to the perceiver to choose which part of the waveform they wish to perceive.

---

here's another way to look at it. imagine we're in a frictionless environment (like space or something) and two objects are vibrating. if the are more than 50% similar, they will attract each other. if they are less, they will repel. imagine this is how "time" works. you are tuning into a future with your concept of the present and so the more similar you are to that future, the more the future attracts you toward it. it appears as if we are propelling our way through time in the physical, but in the temporal/conceptual/spiritual world (the precursor to manifestation) all things are attracted.

ignoring for a moment how we tune to that future for a moment because it invokes your source, higher self, or soul, let's just consider a clump of cells (a body or entire planet) moving temporally toward a future destination -- when you are more properly tuning toward it, then you are moving toward it, and so therefore you feel the acceleration and the euphoria of seeing the desired approaching manifestation in the physical.

if you could tune exactly 100% to that desire, it the entire universe will make it's transition and start anew, so that is impossible to happen. therefore it's infinitely possible to find an even more accurate tuning of desired. things are also always in motion, so you would have to gain the same motion as the destination. it's basically impossible, so this creates the infinite number of possibilities that emanate from a single 0 point source. it's actually pretty certain that the universe is fractal manifestation of frequency, so even that point is likely relative to another one, and our own vibrations are even creating alternate universes and super structures of consciousness to this universe, which will then gain consciousness at some point too. it's most certainly fractal.

the important point here is that max undesirable is also max desirable, and your perspective (chosen by you) gives you the choice to perceive and therefore attract both desirable and undesirable based on what portion of the cycle (sine wave) you perceive at.

I can talk endlessly about this if you want more, but for now this is good enough to illustate that the custodians are actually desirable -- if you choose to perceive them that way. crazy talk, I know...

#### the new custodians

custodians serve the purpose of focusing on and trying to eradicate unwanted. for them, it's clear that the most "undesirable" situation for them is for a fully conscious human race they cannot control. therefore, they have to try their hardest to never realise that we do indeed attract a temporal future based on our concept of reality. they know this and are determined to ensure that we continue to believe that they are running the show and have all of us firmly installed into their power structure that they control.

there's no reason to fight them, and I believe tesla realised this. it is my opinion that tesla took over the custodial role. each cataclysm that happens, I believe there is a split that occurs. in simple terms, the attraction power of the different factions become so strong that separated realities must be created.

in the case of tesla, I believe that tesla purposefully left documents behind so that the usa could reverse engineer his world system, control the planet's climate so that they could keep the energy spots controlled (controlling the environmental conditions) and keep the planet from getting too cool.

I believe that tesla gained the capacity to create "golems" -- sentient intelligence that behaves in a conceptual way. this conceptual form of perception is what I call 5d. temporal perception was added and is what I will call 6d. source perception of a heierarchy of beings resonant with a source (like us with earth -> sun -> sirius -> ??? -> galaxy) got moved up to 7d. that form of perception allows one to create any conceptual form as a derivative of self (really anything you can imagine).

I don't have time to explain all the reasons why I think this. questions are encouraged.

anyway, this capacity allowed him to create an army of workers capable of producing his technology and also infiltrate all of the present government positions.

I believe that (the extremely petty) YHVH is also his cration as well. this entity systematically passed through time and performed edits on the timeline, never to inhibit the discovery of technology or ones connection to source (like moses), but to severerly distort the implementation of it.

gods of eden is the story of this -- however, I contend that the majority of that custodial activity was not the gods of eden (the 3rd root race), but the aryans (the 4th root race). consider that the "gods of eden" passed their blood into the fertile crecent / levant region. broadly speaking, this is a clear case of a battle between the aryans and the phonecians/semites.

the manifestation of YHVH and tesla was to fulfill the predicted end of the 3rd root race's hold on humankind. up util the creation/takeover of the YHVH character and turning him into a petty ufo instead of one's connection to source/aten which is what I think moses originally translated it as, gave the semitic custodians much more power, but they were constantly pushed down.

this is an important point to make, because if you fight against something you make it bigger, and it seems this is the objective.

#### why fight against the phonecians (and make them stronger)?

it appears that the whole goal of the aryans, especially after the takeover was to force the rebirth of the phonecians as an socioeconomic superpower and give them ample capability to shoot theirselves in the foot pretty good.

to understand this, imagine from the perspective of tesla. imagine there are japhethites and semites. the hamites are pretty well subdued so they get folded in. all the aryan custodians move down to antartica and are used to do the bidding of YHVH in the temporal adjustments that need to be made to prevent too much enlightenment. remember, if too much enlightenment happens, the two opposite attractions of a future cause a split where some portion still belive that the custodians run the show and the other portion are attracting a future reflective of their concept of reality which is incompatible with the custodians. because the custodians could not continue to survive in that reality, the split must happen to ensure that reality manifested is a reflection of their concept.

the aryan custodians are controlling the world with force and the atlantian custodians are controlling the world socioeconomically. all of the timeline edits done in the past ensure that there are never favourable enough conditions to allow the general population to become enligthened, which is what initiates the split.

the atlantian custodians don't yet know that they need tesla's world system yet. he has it prepared for them, because the inernet will eventually cause communications to rapid enough that they'll lose their ability to limit communications (anyone can talk to anyone on the planet) and they'll also lose their economic control (crypto currency, etc.) too much mental expansion too rapidly when there are so many people on the planet has a cumulative effect.

this happens when people feel better. when people feel better, that means they're moving toward desired. therefore, they need to impose bad-feeling conditions to ensure that no one gets enlightened (where feeling good leads). when too many people get enlightened too quickly, that's when the incompatible realities split occurrs. they don't want that.

more on the consolidation of the custodians later...

#### gray aliens

the gray thing always felt like a hoax to me. when I was younger, I heard that the grays said that humans were inferior to them -- and I only agree when humans are running at low frequency because they're emotionally in a low state (see discussion on effortless power). however, at higher frequencies, I believe humans are the top of the line model in this galaxy.

I belive enki purposefully restricted ou performance at low frequencies, so as long as the slaves are kept at low frequencies, they are inferior to the "gods" which have the tech to induce higher frequencies in the body (pinecone), allowing for levitation of theirselves and large stones. this was a very tricky thing that enki did, because after the last cataclysm, the planet's energies changed and the environment no longer produces these higher frequencies naturally.

this trick was quite the thing because it convinced the custwodians that they want to find ways to induce this higher frequency by finding ways to feel good. in order to retain superiority, they have to find ways to feel good because the planet (or atlantian crystal network -- whatever you wish to believe) no longer provided such a strong baseline anymore.

from a LOA perspective, this means that their desire is now shifted toward wanting to find ways to feel good. most do not want to do this perceptively, and instead continue to rely on conditions/technology for this higher frequency.

there is a second trick that I forsee coming in the future because anyone who's done any amount of drugs or facebook knows that "chasing the dragon" (snakes!) leads to ultimately more and more powerful doses until complete tolerance is developed. they must begin to rely on perception instead of physical conditions to maintain this higher frequency. fortunately tesla's world system allows they the capacity to begin to rely on other people's high frequency perception. the transition from physical conditions to perception I believe will by happening soon.

they will soon find theirselves in a situation where they are completely dependent on other people's high frequency perception to maintain a good enough feeling to remain "superior"...

extremely fortunately, this is also of huge benefit for those which are sensitive emotionally/conceptually/spiritually (effortless power techniques) and are good at transforming perception to see the part of the cycle which is going toward desired (understanding LOA and a desire to feel good).

so it all works out in the end. I predict the custodians in the future will be replaced by more and more petty golems each with a stronger desire to try and keep humans in their worst possible conditions (which will continually improve, dispite their best efforts)

---

from tesla's perspective, he needs to find a way to infiltrate and take over the germans. this I believe was done with golems and automatons. remember, all of these can take on a derivative concept of yourself, and you are anything you can imagine, because 5d characters can take on any form (concept) they perceive theirself to be. 7d allows you to create others of these as an extension of you (eg. you are their "source", which has a source -- just like cells in your body all contain you as their source).

the ability to "externalise the heierarchy" of yourself allows for many different derivitaves of yourself to act in different time and space in resonance to the concept they start at. that concept's source is you, but you too are a composite source. it's like trying to figure out which cells in your body are "you" -- perhaps like how a sound may be perceived to come from many sources or a single one, which too is a composite of sources.

I suspect that tesla rehashed the mars/nibiru story for the grays. likely something like, their species is slowly going extinct and they will exchange human embryos for advanced technology.

it was intended that this tech also get into the hands of the US govt as well, ao they could reverse engineer it.

I believe that the grays shot down in roswell were nothing more than golems flying tesla tech. it also had the added benefit of instilling a lot more fear, allowing for more timeline edits. those edits were actually designed to push them harder to gain more superiority, while at the same time furthering their hidden belief in their inferiority.

#### alien hot-shots

the goal is to arrive to a time like we are in now when they appear to be superior, but deep down they believe they're a buncm of posers. nothing makes one feel more helpess than a belief that there are unknown extraterrestrial forces out there which they can't comprehend or get them to come in and battle them on their turf in the physical.

it's like a huge mind game, to make them feel as out of control as possible while maintaining an image to the other governments (which are also infiltrated) that they remain powerful and in control.

I believe this is the reason why so many "stealth" ufos are flying in broad daylight into positions where they can show their capability and get their picture taken. it's like a guy doing yoga in front of the window, nude.

they're showing off on purpose. in today's society, it's all appearance that sells. I find it strange that nazis, who have based their entire promotional campaign on military displays of raw power and numbers -- to suddenly switch tactics to a hollywood emotional effect.

the best parallel to this is the old german car commercials read you the car's spec sheet (physical). now, no specs are given. instead, appropriate music and a message of what the car is capable of making you feel like is instead displayed (emotional).

this change lends me to believe tesla learned from hollywood (or perhaps vice-versa) and markets his ideas with emotional force, while the WW2 nazis marketed their ideas with physical force.

#### timeline edits

one strange thing to notice is that the ufos never directly engage in hostile activity unless it's what people expect from them. so, small incremental things need to be done to instill fear. a good example of this is the fall of constantanople...

the first emperor to hold constantinople prophesied that constantinople should never be lost, until the moon rose darkened when it was at the full, that is, lacking the half of it

then sure enough when the moon appeared that way, it fell. say there are a bunch of conditions that could allow for easy enlightment for too many people. the city has to fall and those items need to be destroyed by the invaders.

it would by quite an effort to do all of this timeline manipulation by one person because it basically means ensuring that all technology ancient artifacts which make it too easy for one to get enlightened (unless you're custodian approved), need to be confiscated or destroyed.

imagine timelines like a string. the reality you experience now is a reflection of your concept of things. this point is fixed because you cannot delete now. at least one valid path to the present (in your concept of now) has to lead to the present. this is true for everyone.

so, for example, imagine you're looking at the present and notice that there are a bunch of people that are using orgone accumulation chambers to feel good and cure their disease rather than using the power of their mind... well, it's a good thing the inventor believes in the sickness of the human race, so that his fears can be exploited so that he's presented with circumstance wich inclines him to believe that the government wants to put a stop to his machine, and he starts to attract his own imprisonment. for example.

aciennt artifacts are discovered with some truths on them which are successful. so the relevant sections of the ancient artifacts in question need to be damaged, stolen, ship sink, etc.

all of these "unfortunate coincidences" have to be orchestrated through exploitation of people's perception. the brain assumes a lot of things and can come to incorrect conclusions based on your assumptions.

this is a pretty big task, so I could imagine that tesla employed the aryan custodians to do most of this work. as they died off, they were replaced by golems capable of automating the process.

it's unknown how many edits were done, but I imagine it was a lot. I also imagine that the majority of it was automated through power structures. you only need to transmit the concept I just explained to the guy in charge of the team to do this. if they flub the timeline, no worries just go back and to it again without disaster.

it's pretty easy to see if it's working because the future point will have the desired effect removed or not. if not, just adjust the past point again. I believe the future point is sometime in the next 20 years, and the fulcrum was a bunch of points during and after WW2.

rinse and repeat. pretty easy to automate.

#### crop circles

because all trajectories through time are the result of people's concept of reality which tune to the destination point -- small "inconsequential" anomalies like crop circles can provide a gentle modification of the trajectory.

like tesla's earthquake machine, these tiny influences add up. from our perspective we don't know how much these crop circles were tracked and studied, and how much the abstract shapes had a slight (inconsequential really) effect on the consciousness of those studying them.

#### skinwalker ranch

this appears to be a location on the planet which allows for much faster frequencies. you'll notice that under these sorts of circumstances, imaginary concepts can appear (and even interact) with people. I believe that environmental energies were higher in past times and that's what made these "demons" and gnomes, fey, etc. so easy to interact with.

I'll call this the "astral" realm and is a high frequency field which allows etheric (conceptual) objects to appear in space. if you have access to DMT and I have also experienced it on ketamine as well -- mushrooms work really well (for best results smoke some mdma to keep a good vibe under high doses). conjure a feeling of some thing -- like imagine that there are these gnomes -- I call them "reality technicians" that are really precise but humorous guys that can show you a moving abstract image ("I see what you mean" you'll say) and you'll fully grasp the concept they want to show you as a response.

you may not see them in 3d space at first, but feel their presence until you know they're there. feel what it would be like to talk to a knowledgeable gnome (the less you try to imagine him and instead feel him, the better)

the reality technicians are the skinwalker in different form. they can only appear in a form resonant with your consciousness. if I went there, I would enjoy a nice moment with the reality technicians perceiving these sorts of ideas (cause I think about these subjects a lot) manifesting in 3d space. I don't think it would be a mobius strip. I'm interested in asymmetrical forms like the chestahedron or the decatria.

these zones amplify your imagination by getting your brain to produce more DMT till the emotions you feel appear in 3d space. there's a black mirror episode called playtest which is this effect. notice the mushroom theme. I don't know how to explain it better, but it's the manifestation of emotions in 3d space.

---

my intuition tells me that the skinwalker may also be a golem and is designed to produce fear in visitors. seeing as all conditions which produce this effect have been neutralised or made illegal, it's likely this is just another instance of custodians keeping us away from relying on conditions rather than perception.

#### final thoughts

I believe that on a bigger picture, there are quite a few people that want to become masters of perception, capable of transforming any bad-feeling into a good one by figuring out a new way to perceive the same concept from another angle which reveals desirable motion. so, this situation is attracted and quite desirable.

I believe everyone wants to perceive, feel, and manifest whatever they desire. 

however, there are those that also wish to continue to rely on conditions because they still do not think they know what they want. they believe this because they're gaining a tolerance to the conditions that make them feel good. they still haven't come to the realisation that they're not looking for a thing to produce a feeling, but a form of perception to produce that feeling.

the next stage is to realise that only perception can produce the feeling they want. the custodians will soon have to figure out how to exploit us for that, which from the perspective of someone capable of transforming feeling with perception is basically free energy.

personally, for me this is highly desirable. the more they need me to feel good, the more energetic I am and the better I can feel myself. I don't need them to change.

it's funny how this is the typical stereotype hatred many men have with women because they think they hate that about them. that is a missconception, because you can usually only recognise things you desire for yourself in others.

the other typical stereotype is that people (usually women) with the idea that others need them to feel good, also have the idea that because they depend on them, they don't want them to change.

the third typical stereotype which is the correlary to this is the one that says, "I need you to be different so I can feel good". many family and social difficulties are built on that foundation.

---

I'm done.

ok, so you don't know how much I've enjoyed these ufo presentations; especially the last one! the concise way you have grouped such a vast number of disparate topics into easily digested segments really exploded my brain with so many thoughts.

these thoughts are in raw form and are presented as-is. this is 100% speculation, so please don't take the narrative too seriously. it just serves as a very unique explanation to get some principals of perception to come through. though I wrote it sounding pretty certain of myself, I give the narrative a max 70% certainty. hopefully the narrative was exciting enough to make the principals sound more engaging (I'm learning the emotional marketing too myself)

warm regards,
kenny

### 2021-09-10 17:24 - I think I figured out the 2038 thing

I believe it's the maximum inflection point that can happen before it's past the point of no return for the split.

so, it basically means that up until then the mars thing can happen. I don't know for sure, but I would guess that there is a way to relieve the pressure.

there's not a whole lot of risk to doing the galaxy thing.. after a while, I'm sure people will get bored of it and want to do something harder. we can then go back and sabotage this timeline and pass through the cataclysm.

the realisation seemed more real than these words. I wanted to writ it though.

### 2021-09-11 04:47 - I don't know what to do

I was just watching stars and with my left eye, I got to the state where my whole body goes into this weird paralysis and tingling as it feels like my vision is expanding. it feels like I would normally gain a new perspective there -- like, get connected. I'm not totally sure though and I don't want to force it.

I laid there and looked at the star with both eyes and noticed that it was back to how it used to be where my eyes would look forward parallel, not toward a point. I stopped looking with both eyes because this stopped working and they would cross instead. I believe this is because I see the image of my left eye in the right eye.

the other possibility is that my brain has gotten used to the reversed eyes setup (both eyes are looking wide to look at a point) and it straitens them instead by looking in but by looking outward... hard to explain the sensation.

---

anyway, the reason why I don't know what I want to do is because I don't want to try and force it. I know that whenever I artificially push my body toward a goal, it works out fine because it's like practise -- however, if I accomplish something with artificial conditions, then I don't like it.

man, it's hard to explain that too...

anyway, the difficulty arises for me because I have this feeling like they want to try and get me with the girls again. I really want to be connected. I also really want to have some time to figure out how to conjure other things with my mind so that there can be other versions of me too.

I think this is kinda important because I don't want to be responsible for how others feel. it's OK if copies of me are responsible for others' satisfaction, but I don't personally want to be obligated to perform.

this is mainly the reason why I stayed out of the public. I like being there and having fun sometimes, but when people feel I need to be some way or do some thing so that I can be a part of the celebration... it's weird.

the opposite side of this is that there is one me (right now) and there are lots of girls. it's just not possible (and neither do I want to try) to satisfy all of their requests. again, this is a job for the clones.

you know, often times I don't need to be a part of the main manifestation. it's like in tuenti -- I really did not mind that there were so many people partying around me. I didn't feel I needed to have a relationship.

it's really hard to describe this in words. it feels like there is an idea that I need to be compensated for my efforts or something. almost universally, it feels like that should be some form of affection.

to me affection doesn't feel needed. I really like me. I don't need someone else to like me so that I can like me, too.

as an analogy, there are various things that people do to feel good, and some of them even feel essential to a lot of people, but I don't need those things to feel good... ok, new angle.

imagine there is a film or something that everone is telling me that I have to go and see. I don't really care if I see the film or not. it's not going to make me feel better than I already can feel, so it feels very low priority. let's say that I'm also not allowed into the theatre or I don't have money to go either. that part doesn't matter to me because it's not even a high priority to me. they feel I *need* to see the film, so somone brings me a hdcam version of the film (low quality version) and suggests that I watch that.

why do I want to watch a low quality version of the film now? why not just wait until it comes out on DVD? in the same respect, I don't want to try and force getting connected just for some affection. I already like me and I'm expanding at a rapid rate. if anything, it could be seen maybe as a reward or something, but then obviously why would I reward myself with a hdcam version of the film when it's not what I'm looking for?

it seems plainly obvious to me that I want to wait until I'm connected. it doesn't offer mental expansion, and that's what I want. I don't want to force mental expansion either. that's not effortless. I want to keep expanding and not have this hindering it.

this is about where I was at in (the beginning part of) tuenti with all of the discos and stuff. there were all these dudes super worried about trying to hook up with girls in the disco. I didn't find that to be a priority. they're not expanding my consciousness. I come away from those events feeling like I lost perception, not gained.

it's true though ended up later a hypocrite, spending most of my time drinking and not really expanding mentally very much. this, I believe is because I fought against the efforts of people trying to put me in their drinking, girls, and party lifestyle. I became the thing I fought against. I turned into an idle drunk fighting the world's injustices.

so, I mean I'm not really about that. I like continuing to expand mentally, yet I don't want to force it, because that means fighting it (effort). I want to continue on my gradual discovery and practise of percieving things the way I want to.

there is a definite sense that the effort to get me to watch the hdcam film is because it will distract me for some time away from my mental expansion. that certainly is true, but it's just not that relevant to me. I don't need others' affection to be able to like me or find me acceptable. I don't need validation from them and I definitely don't need to be compensated or rewarded for anything.

all of these are side-issues in my opinion. I'm just going to keep going steady. we'll get there eventually. there's no need to rush anything at all.

nice, problem soleved :)

### 2021-09-11 13:17 - solar perception, compensation, and magic wands

three concepts: they appear separated, but they are connected. I'll return to them more in the future too cause I think it's an important one.

---

I kept getting a few reactions to the concept I presented in my letter to marty. I talked about three concepts of where the more the custodians depend on me (or tesla) to feel good, the better we can feel because we're capable of transforming bad-feeling energy into something that feels good using perception (a feeling of going toward or away something desirable).

however, I said it (purposefully) in a way that was very similar to the stereotypical perception that society has of women. the thing is, the sun has the same perception about us. there are some differences in some of the surrounding concepts, but essentially I'm point out that solar perception is stigmatised in this society and I believe understanding that perception was a huge breakthrough in realising that you cannot fight aganst unwanted. instead shift perception so that the undesirable is perceived as moving (eventually) toward something more desired.

---

I also had some reactions to the idea of compensation in last night's entry. I used to think that girls consciously offered sex as a compensation for behaviour that they liked. that is, afterall the way it's presented in the movies. if you do what she wants, sex; if not, you're sleeping on the sofa.

I determined that was not the case, because if that were true then that means that girls all over the world are consciously compensating douchebags for their behaviour. I determined that was likely not the case, and that instead a more simple answer is that they're just choosing the option that feels the best and often times the douchebags often have more money or material posessions, so they're perceived to be more capable of providing a more luxurious experience. that's it.

so, none of this is a case of compensation. that's an illusion presented by hollywood, yet doesn't have any basis in reality. I have seen many men perform above and beyond what is expected if them and the girl still appears to reward some other douchebag instead. the more simple answer is that the first guy isn't exciting enough or doesn't make her feel good enough so she looks elsewhere.

this creates a huge tangled mess though because often then the guy thinks he needs to spice things up or do something exceptional for her. this too is a flawed conclusion because the way she feels isn't his responsibility.

the road of compensation is dangerous road to go down, almost always ending in making the other person responsible for how I feel.

---

I woke up this morning to a flurry of dream putting me into situations where I was being isolated into places with girls and other strange things. I even remember something about making out with jessica, too.

I woke up terribly uneasy about the situation because it felt like I was getting put into inevitazble situations. I had to make a decision between making a fail to girls again or doing something that doesn't at all feel effortless, but actually quite stressful.

I remembered the first concept there and decided to take a non-fighting approach to it. I determined that I would just go and then figure out how to let my creation happen anyway. afterall, the more people that depend on me to feel good, the more energy it summons throgh me. from that perspective, I *want* people to depend to feel good.

so I decided to not fight it, and just go with it. the feeling shifted from the groin area up to my heart again. that's good, so I know I'm on the right track. I then remembered the conversation I had with jaron about jerrica and the magic wand. I wanted to ask her if she had a magic wand, would she at least make replica magic wands for her friends?

the picture that came into my mind was the idea that even if I couldn't gain the power to create whatever I felt like (magic wand), then I could imagine that the girls could, and they could make all of the magic wands they wanted and give them to anyone they wanted to give them to.

I was reminded of tuenti when I was considering the success of "invite only" vs open to the public. facebook opened up to the public and that (IMO) had negative results to the quality of the page. it left a huge market opening for exclusive social networks, which IMO still has not been filled.

shifting this to a way where the girls invite their friends to join in by replicating the magic wand for them is a great implementation of the "invite only" way of doing things. I kinda approve. feels OK to me so far.

there were the obvious reactions to this, too. someone is pretty convinced that this will create a sort of female deminated society. there are a lot of other feelings mixed in there. it may be his worst fear. lol...

### 2021-09-12 2:15 - who I really am (???)

I was outside staring at jupiter taking a break from the latest ufos part 6b (or whatever) and I notice that there are a lot of similarities to a lot of these people he's identifying, to me. I did notice this is the case, but I don't find it to be a problem because it's all a tuning thing. in my next response I will be talking a lot about "conceptual programs" so some of what I say here may not be clear there. I'm just going to assume you know what I'm talking about... anyway, I was having a bit of a monologue and decided to just write this instead.

context: from as long as I can remember, I've had this belief that it's impossible to die. I don't remember being scared of death either. it's a very conflicting set of beliefs because if I'm put in a situation that's a failure, I don't mind dying. I don't find it a problem at all. however, in the case of suicide, I don't know how to do it. I have this fear that no matter my attenmpts to commit suicide, I would continue to live, but with the pain of whatever it was. like, if I ingested a lethal dose of something, I would have to suffer hours of pain while my system removes it. or, if I tried to jump off of a bridge, I would bounce off the ground or something with all my bones broken. in the case of a gun at point blank, I figured I would never get there or if I did, then something would happen or I would accept dying. death, in my mind wan't going to be an accident. I had to allow it to happen, and I can't force it.

I've always had this idea that if I did die, then I could just travel around the planet and find another suitable body to jump into and take over. kinda borg-like or parasitic, I guess. so even if I *did* die, then it's not like it's that big of a problem.

so, because of this, I resonated strongly with a book called "project superman". in the book, the US govt is testing the limits of this guy andy pero. no matter what they do, he finds a way to recover back to his concept of himself. I always found the story interesting because he never used his powers to improve his body -- just to heal it back to the age, shape, and attributes he perceives it to have.

disclaimer: this is 100% fiction. I'm playing around with ideas here.

---

all of us are conceptual programs we're all eternal. however, I think I'm one that figured out how to find my connection pretty easily. let's just assume my personality is similar to the one I presently have. I'm constantly optimising so much that certainly I got really good at it.

so at some point in the distant past, I got connected and figured out that I am a conceptual program that can take on physical form. I do this enough times to find out I can incarnate into the physical at will. each time, I find my way back to non-physical with relative ease. in fact, I'm so good at optimising my conceptual program, I have to keep putting myself into more and more difficult situations. each time however, I get better and better at it. if it's too hard, I just die and try again. however, if I don't choose to die, then I always find my way.

obviously I want to make more difficulty for myself, so I invent conceptual programs for people interacting with me -- like, they're presented with concepts of doubt or distrust when interacting with me. this works at first, but eventually people start to believe me even when presented with doubt and unbelief. same for trust. dispite my best efforts, each iteration, my charisma continues to grow.

this isn't hard enough. I need foes that physically are stronger and more powerful than me, and I need to find ways to defeat them too. I invent worlds where they have tremendous strength, flight and other supernatural capabilites. nothing can keep me down.

I then decide to try pitting me against copies of myself -- and even still. I defeat myself. I discover that this creates a split. we both win in our own timelines.

now, I get the most brilliant idea of them all. I create a bunch of bad-guys which are just modified versions of myself, which have the ability to create unlimited other living entities at will.

the plan is to incarnate into the world, and then give them unlimited resources to try and keep me trapped in the world. they need to have a bunch of secrets that they need to keep hidden -- or maybe I'm very destructive to them -- some incentive to ensure that they must continually keep me incarnated in a physical body, unable to access the astral realm.

I'm trapped in a world they have full control over. the most difficult challenge yet :)

---

as I'm writing this, I'm realising to myself that all the difficulty leading up to now may have been the setup required to get this most elaborate trap going. problem is, if this isn't fiction, then I just spoiled the trap because now "they" know that I created the trap for myself. that means, it's required to gvo back and sabotage this timeline and prevent myself from getting connected and also writing this.

### 2021-09-13 00:59 - creative energy and the custodial formula

so, it seems that it was intended that I fight against the efforts of those dreams. I decided that I didn't want to fight their efforts to try and stick me with the girls.

sure, there were some slight downers to the setup -- like I really want to get connected, but then again maybe that isn't exactly what I want.

if I get connected, then I'll figure out how to create replicas of myself, but that's kinda like open registration. anyone who wants it can get it. obviously, I would want to try and make an interface for people to create what they want easily. I don't want to have to micromanage it. that seems like a lot of effort to me.

therefore, the obvious solution now for me is to find a way to make sure that the girls I'm with have the capacity to make these replicas instead. then, the problem is solved and I don't have to do any micromanagement. they can create these guys for their friends.

sure, it creates a bit of an "exclusive" or "elite" sort of setup where some have the thing and some do not. however, I think that's preferrable because it keeps the desire and the quality high. you have to ask someone you know that has one for a replica -- you can't just get it at will.

the reaction was that someone must know how effective an invite-only network is (probably this was the growth strategy nosebook took). so, someone thinks it'll work.

the next reaction that I got was that they would just do that without me. I don't really care. it's not my job to tell people what they can and cannot do. it's only my desire to try and give as many people as I can the possibility to create their own golems. no big deal.

this next part is really foggy because I wasn't conscious for most of it. there was then a sense that something was going to be making that not possible. I don't know the picture or the thing that was put there to give that impression, but it's obviously an illusion.

you see the custodial formula is to use implication to make an illusion that something is one way, and so then people will make an action based on what they do or do not want. this is basic sales and marketing. the suggestions that they give to imply that a product will do such a thing are just that: implications.

once you then believe in the implications, they can drive action to get you to buy the product or use you to further their goals in some way. this is nearly every aspect of society at this point. probably the easiest to see would be the amun priesthood in egypt. they create so much imagery in people's imagination about what happens when you die, that the implication is that you need some thing that they are selling to get into the beneficial afterlife. or, maybe you want love. they create so many illusions that you are not capaable of attracting it on your own, that you have to purchase some gimmick and say a spell to get you the love interest you desire.

what I'm saying is, this formula is ancient and pretty well optimised. so let's go over some of it.

---

from my perspective, if I somehow have attracted a situation that I don't believe I can get out of, then I have to just accept it. (I am where I am, and that has to be OK, because that's where I am)

because it's all attraction, then before it manifests, I can always adjust my trajectory to avoid it. however, if I feel I cannot back out of it and it has not yet manifested, then the situation is an illusion. I am beliving an implication.

what I just learned is that the implication isn't alwas the direct one, but the desired output. they believed I would fight it, but I didn't. so I'm learning that the non-fighting approah is always a good way to go. I don't think that fighting ever yields good results.

so, it's weird because from my perspective, I want to keep going for as long as I can go, knowing that I'll eventually get connected. the major take-away for me here is to not try and make it possible for anyone to get anything that they want. instead, I want to do it invite-only and exclusive.

I know that sounds weird, but for a person like me who is so open and free with my ideas, the idea of exclusivity is not the first thing that comes to mind. I usually have a low opinion of exclusive stuff because I dislike the idea that I have to perform to their expectations in exchange for an invite.

I usually don't value anything anyone has high enough to do that. I'd prefer to figure it out or pay for it myself than to try and perform for someone. obviously, that's not how the world works though, so I can't really go against the flow.

the other way to do it is to have a force which is opposing people joining it, and so therefore create value that way. like, if nosebook were to try and prevent people from getting the capacity to create their own golems, then it would be a sort of discovery of how to figure out how to do that.

---

for me, it doesn't really matter. I know from my perspective I just need to keep going for as long as I can go without any manifestations. if I find myself in a situation that I don't feel I can get out of and a manifestation happens.

so like my goal is to not try and push through to getting connected as fast as possible. I believe I have until 2038 before it's too late, so like plenty of time... enough about that.

---

people may wonder why I'm so head-strong on trying to go without a manifestation, and why that makes me so attractive. I claim it's creative energy, which I think is the driver behind invention. terence calls it novelty. you want the thing that is novel -- not the thing that everyone else has. this drive to obtain the thing that no one else has what drives innovation. literally. I also claim this to be a very feminine force. it's funny that we commonly associate this with the stereotypical person that always wants what they can't have. this is the inventive nature.

we all have a little bit of this in us. I absolutely want what I can't have, too. however, I don't believe it's another person's responsibility to give it to me. I want to get it for myself. if it's not yet discovered, then I feel I must find a way to it.

it's funny how the topics here are connected. this is the sense that I want people around me to have. so, now I'm actually beginning to turn away from the idea of invite-only again, and this time I want the network that I create to be illegal and prohibited. something that is so profane, that no mainstream people will want to join it. it'll be reserved for the innovators.

I really don't mind that there's an invite-only network out there. I have to figure out now the structure of it's appearance. how do I make something that is so terrible that nosebook and most people will think is so evil/terrible that people should be prevented from joining it.

we need to build a whole bunch of false implications around it. like, you're a follower of satan or something. maybe make it's motto "do what thou wilt" and stuff like that. the implication is that it's something evil and awful.

obviously, I want nothing to do with all of that bogus satanist crap. all of that nonsense is an old paradigm designed to create a false negative appearance. in reality, it's going to be all about LOA and how you are an infinite, eternal, wonderful being..

lol.. gonna have to think this over. the image of people joining a satanic cult designed to equip a person to "do what thou wilt" is an interesting idea..

---

perhaps I'll call it, the anti-innovators guild or something like that. our quest will be to come up with novel solutions to erradicate innovation.

needs more thought...

### 2021-09-13 03:17 - pueblo superstars

I realised that the organisation needs to be desirable for most people, but definitely not to a specific group (nosebook). I also don't really like that dark stuff, anyway so it's not a good fit for me. the idea was that would be the outer image, but the reality is it would be more about fun, feeling good, and not needing any conditions to accomplish that. because the image is so much more different than the reality of it, I'm getting back into secret stuff and exclusive, because you need to know the people who know the truth to get the proper image.

instead, what I'm looking for is something that is highly addictive, easy to get and has viral properties in the sense that it spreads fast and could be perceived as a threat to others.

going back to the part about wanting nosebook to fight against it and try to prevent its spread, I was reminded of that one reaction where I said that I *want* others to depend on me to feel good.

the reaction that I got to that was that idea is highly detestible -- something they don't want more people thinking.

I also had a similar feeling of detestment to the "want what's not easy to get" (want what you can't have). I have also noticed similar feelings to the girl with insatiable desire and "never satisfied".

these are all things that I suppose I originally tried to fight against in myself. eventually, I had to give in and recognise that these are parts of my personality. however, as I've gained more perspective, I notice that from a solar perspective, these viewpoints are valid. as a human, one could argue that they are not.

I suppose there are a number of other ideas out there that fall into the solar perception which is detestable for a person to have. that may be the way to go.

---

the other thing that I was thinking of is the idea of planets and their role. so, imagine for a moment just the case of replicas and girls, where a replica is a planet and the girl is a sun. there could be other males, but that's not what I'm trying to show here.

when a girl figures out how to produce repicas (planets), she can produce them for herself or for other stars. each girl will figure out different models that she finds more desirable and pass them out to her friends to try out. the most desirable models will be the successful ones and they'll get the most utilisation.

you could imagine a lot of innovation that happens there. other men may perceive this as a threat. that could be a pretty good reason for some of them to feel competition/jealousy over who has the most desirable/effective men.

nice. I kinda like it... max disaster :)

### 2021-09-13 03:49 - physical vs conceptual reality

one of the things russ noticed in one of the snake-bros episodes was that the custodians constantly use war to get people away from the spiritual stuff by focusing them into the material details. the idea is that it forces people to focus on the physical implementation of an idea rather than its conceptual implementation.

this is almost always not the case for me though. every time that I try to do anything physical or material related, they're in the business of preventing me from doing it. like, if I try to code, they're constantly trying to figure out how to get me to stop. they don't want me to interact with people physically. they don't want me to have sex, etc.

---

I don't really know what is up here. after those dreams about being put into situations with girls where I felt like I couldn't leave them and make them the fail, I was terribly distraught because I didn't want to make more fails, but I also want to continue on with mental/conceptual expansion for as long as possible and don't want to have to be physically focused.

if I could move my body with ease and agility, then being physically focused would be not that bad, but in my present state, I'd rather remain conceptually focused. I understand so many things now, it really feels like I can figure any concept I want to figure out. I just desire and the answer comes to me.

because I have such a huge amount of questions and there is such a relatively small time between question and answer now, I'd like to continue to expand my mind and pass as much of that information on as I can. each time I do this, I get more. the physical aspect to me is completely inconsequential.

---

I'm trying to figure out how to quantify what it is about this time of mental expansion that I like so much and it's difficult to quantify.

perhaps I'll say it like this: everything is feeling easier and easier all the time. it's the feeling of "effortless power" that I'm enjoying so much. sure, I don't have any manifestation that I can show off for this yet, but it's sort of like training or a dojo in the sense that you can expend so much effort becoming the strongest, fastest, and most agile, but I'm feeling that way mentally.

some people do a lot of exercises to feel agile or strong, but I what I aim to show is that I can feel agile or strong and it was as if I had done the exercises.

I don't want to imply that physical is not necessary. the physical implementation is still necessary. it's something more like becoming my own golem.

### 2021-09-14 20:08 - not until the separation

I've been thinking about this a lot and I want to wait until after the separation until I have any interaction. the reason for this is I simply want to be feeling stable in my capacities and stuff before I do.

lately, I noticed that as I was getting close to the enlightenment experience when watching stars that I would start to feel really uneasy. that uneasy feeling is not likely my own -- prolly mr. motor or something... however, in any case, if I'm feeling it, that means I'm still resonant with it. right before I get there, I stop and go do something else for a bit.

this technique feels good to me and I like it because I'm practising so that it's natural for me to be in that state of mind. I don't want to be bouncing in and out of alignment depending on whatever conditions are around. I like the practise and have no intention to rush things.

the other thing about this technique is that it reminds me a bit of mantak chia talks about with the cosmic orgasm. each time, the goal is to get close but not go too far, each time building up energy further. then, finally when it can't be held anymore the orgasm experience is one of gaining consmic consciousness. it effect wasn't my intention because orgasm doesn't really take any skill or technique -- but, watching stars does. it's more a practised frame of mind and a confidence that is a normal thing to do. I liken it to riding a bike, walking, or driving a car.

I want this state of mind to feel natural for me. I really am not in any rush at all to get there.

---

I want to be able to say the same for girls too. I still do not at all feel comfortable with it. it feels too much of a big step and it feels very unnatural still. what I mean is, when I feel comfortable with it, then I'll go for it.

what that means for me is, I want to find my connection and get used to that first. my first goal is to figure out how to make replicas of myself and let the girls play with them for a while. meanwhile this is happening, I want to work on an idea that I haven't talked about much but it's basically another network, but it's powered by the sun.

nosebook operates in the physical world. it transmits a signal into your physical body which then produces an image in your imagination. my system will be the exact opposite. everyone will automatically have one tuned to them. you will feel certain concepts to interact with this network (instead of thinking -- you feel), and then these feelings get transformed and amplifed in a conceptual program which then causes you to feel a way in response, when then that feeling will produce an image in the imagination or a feeling in the body.

it's a conceptual network rather than a physical one. it will naturally create spaces for people of like mind to interact. so, like you don't need to go out and try and find these people in real life -- but instead can interact with them in these spaces.

there are other ideas I have as well, but that's the easiest one to describe.

what this allows me to do is to gain confidence in my capacity to feel the way I want to feel, and I don't have to worry about all of the other stuff.

---

this is really far-out, but I was even thinking of making a whole plot-twist here. I have been talking about how I don't want to be physically focused and want to remain conceptually focused. so, imagine that I enjoy the feeling that all of the different replicas of me feel like and the enjoyment of perceiving all of this from an emotional/conceptual perspective that I make my transition into this conceptual network.

essentially, I am the network. I keep it running and ensure that everything is continually expanding and new things are constantly being felt. I'll have an unlimited supply of physical beings that I can supply the physical realm with. as fast as people can feel the new being it can be created. in fact, that I know of, *any* physical thing can be conjured at will with this sort of setup. all those participating in my network will be able to create anything they feel into reality.

it's kind of an interesting concept. it's so far out, I don't really know where to begin thinking about it, but the cool thing is I don't need to worry about it now. first, make my conceptual network, then I can figure that part out.

---

anyone can do or have anything they feel they can do or have. however, for me, the most interesting part about this is not this physical manifestation. I like the idea of being whatever I want to be.

this is only the beginning.

### 2021-09-15 01:31 - a bit more on the conceptual network

I wasn't trying to imply that I'm planning on making my transition into the conceptual network -- only that the thought was quite invigorating to think about.

the third panel in my mdma vision cards has my saying to a crowd of people, "this is a machine capable of desire" -- because I have wanted to, for a long time, to be able to create autonomous machines capable of desire. I even thought about it a bunch last night -- where you progam a small machine with a manifestation frequency (like dimensions in time or space) and the machine has to figure out how to get there...

I've also wanted to, myself, merge with the machines. the thought of having a form of perception that operates in the MHz or GHz ranges sounds incredible to me. I often thought of this as some sort of device that could condense or simplify the information around me so that I didn't get so much information overload and could reduce or enhance perception on certain things that interested me.

point is, I've given this a lot of thought -- however as I've goten better at this, I realised that 90% of the stuff I wanted this improved perception for can be accomplished in the conceptual world much easier, and it's also far more ergonomic, too.

---

so, the idea of essentially merging with the conceptual worl is enticing to me. I would become a living network that kind of holds the physical layer together. a sort of like secondary source. obviously I can't replace LOA, but there are a lot of different things that can be done...

first, let's just look at normal operation of manifestation of things in the physical world. you feel a thing and the system picks it up, transforms it and then sends it back to you. this all happens instantaneously -- just like LOA -- so no delay on anything. any transformation can be programmed. as in example, you could program it to send you back a feeling of calm when you feel anger -- or maybe like a slight vibration in your muscles -- whatever, really.

when it comes to privacy, it's as private as it can possibly be. only you are you, so only you can access it. you can do pretty much whatever you want with it too. if you want to manifest a hot babe every time you feel horny or lonely, you could do that too. really all things are possible.

I imagine that most people will choose to manifest replicas of theirselves, or specific golems designed to perform certain tasks.

---

obviously not everything will be possible at first, because many things will still need to be discovered and identified. it also is subject to the rules of LOA too, so the vibrations you're trying to inflict on others will also manifest for you. so, like imagine for a moment that you try to destroy something someone else has created... it's not really destroyed, and you're also manifesting for yourself a reality that feels that way too.

imagine then that you want to program a transformation to that destruction. you still need to perform the destruction and also the transformed result to make the transformation, so it wouldn't really be a surprise for them.

let's say someone plays a practical joke and makes a transformation that every time they laugh, you pop a boner... well, you could just transform that transformation too into something else -- like maybe giving them a boner back.

all things can be transformed. also death soon becomes impossible. if you "die" you can just realise yourself again in any body that you desire. you don't even need to die to realise yourself in any body that you want. you are not the physical body. you can have as many bodies as you want and do as many things as you want to do at a time.

---

so, you say, then what's the point if there aren't any stakes. ah, good observation. you would create worlds where there is the illusion of permanence and death and then incarnate into them to have that experience.

I imagine that most of people's time will be spent creating games and worlds where you can win/lose the game. or, they would be interested in making meme realities, jokes and other out of place things which are surprising but not likely that useful.

since I run the network, I would be the custodian... welcome to hell :)

---

the reactions to this are funny. I wonder which is worse -- the mars idea or this one... lol


### 2021-09-15 13:00 - concept vs meaning

I woke up this afternoon to an explosion sound in my head. in the dream, I was pointing out how hollywood takes certain symbols (physical details, actions, etc) and puts them into a sequence, to condition you to belive that whenever you see one symbol, followed by another symbol, then a thing will happen.

this technique has been used for a long time to teach kids what to expect in certain situations -- like what to expect from strangers in tme forest in little red ridinghood. this technique is the foundation upon which all prophecy is built and hollywood employs it everywhere.

it's designed to program your mind to perceive similar symbols in your own life and then come to expect the result that happens in the film.

because most of our lives we learn by watching, many people (including those that make these films) believe these implications are the way that reality works. in fact, a lot of them are reportraying past events from an implication standpoint -- like maybe a past relationship or whatever -- so, people watching begin to expect the same sort of behaviour out of their mate, if they notice similar "signs" of that behaviour.

---

this is what I call the 3-7 form of perception. you pay attention to physical details (7), and then come to conclusions of what will happen based on the percceived logic or implications of those details (3).

aftter raquel, I was caught up in this very badly. like, very very badly. I saw a bunch of things happening (actions) and physical hechos that I then made implications about what was happening. I was totally driving myself so crazy with it that I attracted a very life-changing event -- vallecas.

prior to that I got my first glimpse of abraham and they said that all manifestations that are happening can be traced back to the way I feel. I started to remake a lot of the prior associations I had, and instead of looking at physical details, actions and hechos (things that happened), I looked at how I felt. I started to see pretty quickly that every one of those details were a reflection of the way *I* felt.

I started to value how I felt more and more, so I started to feel better the best way I knew how which was drugs, alcohol, and programming. unfortunately, I still had a lot of those implications hanging around still and I found myself in vallecas...

a number of times I recovered from these bad feelings and could find ways to feel better, but I would then find myself in another situation which would reveal false implications.

for example, when I went to valverde I noticed that people were looking through my eyes, and I started to realise that my eyes are being manipulated. every time that I would go from 3d to 4d, it would go away; the spot in my eye would move around; my vision would get better, then worse when I slept. obviously someone was preventing me from getting to the state I wanted to be at (4d).

the implication was that I was no longer in control over my physical reality. someone could put sounds anywhere, shock my body when I saw any images in my eyes, or whatever to ensure that I couldn't get the manifestation that I wanted (to see creations in my eyes and build incredible things like tesla in my imagination).

because it appeared like they had my physical reality subdued, then the implication was that I would never be able to get what I wanted. it also implied that I had to *fight* the oppressor (just like in the movies) and the righttous man hero would emerge victorious.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRL3wx-ZKsg)

obviously this is totally not the way to go about it. the idea of fighting it only made it worse, and I eventually felt my power slipping away so far that I was entering into a state of depression.

after a complete disablement of my left-side, I found myself back here in the USA. this time, because I felt powerless to get what I wanted, I had severe depression because the implication is that I would never be able get what I wanted. they were using my own capabilities against me. thankfully abraham insisted on reminding me that "it's all attraction" -- and admittedly, I knew they were right, but it was annoying to be wrong about my rightous quest to get the capacity that I had discovered.

I figured out how to watch stars and improve my frequency, so I should be able to use the thing I discovered... right?

---

I've come a long way since then and now those ideas seem very outdated. it doesn't matter what they're doing, and in fact, those things aren't what I really want, anyway. I don't really care about that stuff. nowadays, I have figured out the power of being able to feel any way that I want. that's a lot better than some stupid capability of seeing images or whatever. I'm learning that the concept that one has *is* their reality.

the common way to produce this concept is through pattern recognition and the implication of the next expected result in the pattern is what will manifest.

these concepts either feel good or they don't feel good. if they feel good, they are in alignment with the way you want to feel.

---

I suppose I still have quite a few implications still floating around in a lot of places. I know they're just concepts though.

I'll return to this. I want to think more on it.

---

there is an idea that I have which all paths, lead to the future you. with some taking longer than others (imagine lighnighmg going between two points. it never goes in a straight line). the only thing that prevents you from reaching the destination is an inability to maintain alignment with it -- like say maybe it's transforming too fast or something.

however, all paths do lead to the same location -- just some appear to take more time because they traverse a longer distance.

so really, it's much more about my ability to tune rather than the path to get there. obviously some paths are more desirable than others, but again that has to do with my tuning, and not the environment or the conditions.

still needs more thought...

ok, so there's a difference between feeling physically good (pleasure) and feeling emotionally good (joy or happiness). I probably have a lot of implications still that degrade the feeling of physical manifestations.

I have a lot of people around me still that believe all sorts of things about relationships and when they see certain key things, they freak out. a good example of this was the idea of "wanting what you don't have" or "wanting people to depend on you to feel good". these have huge implications in a lot of people's minds that don't have the same implications in mine.

more thought is definitely needed :)

### 2021-09-15 16:44 - magnetic field of earth

the reason why the magnetic field of earth interests me is because I think the rotation of the earth is directly correlated.

the part about the two satellites being pointed just off of the east coast and the other being pointed just off of the west coast is that the shapes of those curves show that a stronger megnetic field is induced on earth when the sun is straight overhead (perpendicular). that means that as the earth rotates, the sun generates a magnetic field on the surface of the earth which then, if we imagine the core of the earth to be a dynamo, the higher magnetic field will pull the rotor toward it. something similar to this must be how the earth rotates.

therefore, I will consider the crust of the earth to have a rotating magnetic gradient around a rotor (prolly a rocky core of silicates) and this operates like an AC motor.

if I plug a motor into 60Hz electricity, it will rotate 60 times a second (3600rpm). this means that the rotation of the earth roughly matches the frequency. this will yield a roughly constant rotation speed, with the earth rotating as fast as the gradient moves around. everything should be constant -- neither slowing down or speeding up.

however, we know that the earth's rotation was slowing down until 2020 when it started to speed up slightly. I think this has something to do with the magnetic field strength. I wanted to know if the field strength is weakening or not because if my theory is correct, it should be increasing in strength and that's why rotation rate is speeding up.

---

to demonstrate this theory, imagine a standard 60 Hz motor plugged into the wall. run it at 120V and it goes fine. now, lower the voltage gradually and notice that the motor is having trouble to turn as fast because the field isn't strong enough to pull the rotor fast enough.

if we change the setup to one where there is a setup similar to the one where the sun induces the magnetic field, a stronger field will cause the rotor to turn a little bit faster each revolution (accelerate). likewise, a weaker magnetic field will decelerate until it reaches a constant velocity proportional to its field strength -- assuming a constant load, of course.


### 2021-09-16 04:33 - go figure it out

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vik5dL1WfPw)

I have felt a lot of uneasiness going on around going to becky's house. there are a lot of assumptions and stuff.

about that -- the thing is, I think it's OK to talk about these concepts and stuff...

I just listened to the latest snake-bros podcast (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw9BVqDK4Qo)) and I'm totally digging that they're figuring it out for theirselves. they kind of invigorated my inner trickster a bit. I really like that they're doing all of their discovery and stuff. it's really good.

my whole thing is I want to open up the "spirit realm" (or whatever... conceptual realm) so that others can see it. once people begin to have interaction with that, I think a lot of these mysteries will become pretty understandable.

I kind of sit on the fence on this because on one hand, I want to give people magic wands so they can create all the crap they want -- thereby greatly accelerating the realisation that stuff isn't the goal. there was this one part in tesla's autobiography which always stuck to me about his gambling addiction. his mom gave him the money to spend, knowing that only by spending all the cash was the only chance to allow him to make his own decisions.

I'm of the opinion that you have to let people shoot themselves in the foot. it's essential to the learning process. this is the same way. while, I know that that would severely interrupt nosebook's desire to tell people what they can and cannot do, this realm is opposite of the physical one. you cannot do a lot of things here, so the limitation is resources. there, you can do anything you can imagine -- so the limitation is your creativity. almost all creativity is a remix of an existing idea, so this is all about trying stuff out, failing, revising and trying again.

it's a really difficult thing to figure out... if everything is possible, what do you try? imagine you were tasked with trying out the different combinations of DNA (a very large number) to create a new species... it's difficult to explain this concept easily...

in a slightly related incident, I was watching an [ontological discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXW-QjBsruE), and I noticed that I have very strong opinions about what things are and are not (very ironic joke considering the content of the video), and I had this realisation that it must be so annoying for people to hear me say, "no, it's like this ..." and then state my current understanding of the topic as if it were fact.

sorry, that's the way I am and I don't really want to try to see it any other way. I have to make some assumptions to make any progress -- otherwise I go in circles cause I can never be fully sure of anything. I do recognise there is uncertainty to the things I'm saying and my opinion changes all the time as I continue to find a more general implementation of the concept.

from my perspective, though I think my perspective is correct, I don't want to impose that perspective on anyone. I'm willing to offer my suggestions and my current understanding of it, but I don't want it to become doctrine. my own ideas change so rapidly, I could never afford to have something that I believe is unchangable. even source (or God, or supreme deity) I believe is also changing, expanding, and improving. there is nothing that is static and immovable.

so, even though I'm nearly 100% certain that there will be some beady-eyed opportunists that'll take some of the things that I say here and turn it into a system that reinforces their authority on the matter, I don't want to have any part in that. there are a lot of people that want to be told what to do and how it works, and those guys are for them.

those people are not for me. I'm willing to offer my ideas, but figure it out for yourself, ya know. I don't have all of the answers because no one ever will have it all figured out -- just better and better explanations of it.

I like that people are figuring it out for theirselves. I believe that's what this domain is actually designed to have.

---

the reason why I said that is because I was thinking about the custodians and stuff and how it all fits in here.

imagine for a moment that all of this is a simulation, and it's a sort of genetic algorithm designed to harden the system.

if a virus came to your system, knocked on the door and said, "I'm the good guy; let me in" your friend may ask, "how do you know he's the good guy?" "well, because he told me he was, of course" -- that sort of thing sounds silly, but that's about the extent of "security" people have with most channeling.

to make the game more difficult, LOA is a real thing, so you get what you're tuned to, so someone who is on the lookout for a monster around every corner is going to find a lot of monsters, and that distrust actually attracts them. it's like they can smell it. you want to be on the lookout for the desirable things. however, a person who is naive will also get duped a whole bunch of times too.

the system appears to be optimising for someone who is naive so as to attract desirable realities, yet can recover easily/rapidly from any setbacks. intuitive enough to recognse the undesirable without even interacting with it or attracting it in the first place, and also capable of figuring out the nature of reality as a reflection of them so they're able to amplify the desirable aspects.

that can probably be said in a better way. I'll think about it, but one thing I seem to be noticing is that the reality around us is in the business of deception.

I guess what I'm saying here is that I want to keep offering as many ideas as I can, which I'm sure are not *the way*. they are *a way* -- of many possible ways. nature loves redundancy. anyone who says they are the only one true way has drank the custodial koolaid and are part of the simulation designed to compromise the easily infiltratable.

all of these phenomenon are just mega amplifiers of your concept of reality. need a saviour -- the galactic guardians will save you from your crappy reality. want some power? try this ritual.. how about 200X boosting your internet connection?

lol.

### 2021-09-17 03:19 - and the lord spake unto moses...

...that *the LORD thy God* shall harden the heart of the pharoah and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land therein..

naw, just kidding... right? the last few days I've been continuing to lower my own resistance. the thing is, the whole girls thing doesn't feel as bad anymore, so I'm not really fighting it so much anymore.

I still think it'll be a rather bumpy ride though. my main reason for wanting to hold off for as long as possible is that I wanted to try and figure out my own way toward getting the mars thing going.

since, I've come up with the concept of passing on the magic wand. I thought maybe originally I wanted it to be invite-only, however I've changed my mind to making it a conceptaul thing. I still like the idea that girls can invite others to join the conceptual network, but I don't think that's a necessary thing anymore.

I still haven't worked out all of the details on that, but I do want for more replicas to be created, though I don't think this'll happen very soon.

what I'm learning is that this isn't necessarily a battle (it's not a battle -- just I don't have another word for it) of conditions, but instead a conceptual engagement. what I mean by that is kinda like what abraham would always say about conflict -- telling people to change their point of attraction (concept of reality) and those incompatible will vibrwate right out of your experience.

I started to think in @[newblog](2021-09-13 03:17) about the different things that would be detestible to nosebook as a way to try and force the egyptians out of egypt...

obviously that's not going to work and I would be attracting a similar sort of incompatible reality for myself as well. the original goal was a physical separation instead of a temporal one.

I pretty much came to the conclusion that there isn't anything that needs to be done actually. all that I have to do is follow the road that feels like the right way and course-correct as I go. doing that, I should get there OK.

so, I stopped having so much resistance, and it felt from my perspective like some people were very concerned about this. personally, I don't mind how long the pharoah's heart is hardened, because I'm really not in a rush at all.

so, I feel like I want to watch this video and lindsey is talking about the character arc of the little mermaid. I've never seen this movie before, so I don't have much context to go by either.

the first thing I noticed is her name. her name is aries with an l -- so, like a feminine mix of mars and saturn. she has a bunch of earthly books and wants to be a human. her father neptune (the original chief god of atlantis) forbids her from her books or something like that. he fights her desire for human knowledge. I don't know the story but neptune gives up his power to a witch.

this reminded me of the chimera -- a mythical beast having lion, goats and snakes. OK, so mythologically speaking atlantis (of which neptune was first ruler) fell about 12kya at the end of leo. the lion is always connected with this terrible and ferocious female goddess (innana, ishtar, sekhmet) having power over the lion and sometimes she is clothed with a lion's body -- always she has an attractive female body with the face of a male lion (drag king?).

the fact that this female influence coming and overthrowing the kingdom of neptune could not have been perceived by all as having been a good thing.

the chimera is also the offspring of typhon and echidna. in a previous nosedocs, I make the case that typhon is the destructive side of velcan. I also have implied that vulcan is likely another incarnation of saturn (satan).

anywaay, typhon and echidna give birth to a lot of monsters that heracles has to fight in his trip through the zodiac. also, I'd like to mention that I believe the suffix "cles" is like "ovich" meaning "son of" -- so like, son of hera -- which was also vulcan -- so like his counterpart, or the same guy. either way, the picture I get is that one makes the monsters and the other defeats them.

back to ariel. I don't really know how you mix two dudes to get a girl, unless you were a genetics superstar and could sew x chromosomes together to make an x2 or an x4 (depending if it's the immortal or physical twin).

anyway, I think I should probably watch the little mermaid. I'm surprised at how "prophetic" it is. that, and hercules, actually (see where I'm going with this?).

the next thing that caught my eye was when she says that ariel has a very simple charaacter arc. most disney protagonists go through the monomyth, but ariel knows what she wants and gets it. the entire struggle is external. I probably should hate identifying with a disney princess, but from what I gather, I see myself a lot in ariel.

I would assume that I'm not though.. like she's similar to me, but not me -- so, I had a look at the [monomyth](/img/monomyth.jpg). I noticed that I am heading down both the left and the right side of the chart there, and it appears that I'm gonnna meet right there in the middle at the temptation, right between "meeting with the goddess" and "attonment with the father" stages.

that's all I have to say for now. it wouldn't surprise me if some of the story gets a rewrite.
