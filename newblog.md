starting over again

### 2021-09-08 11:05 - effortless power

for a few days (weeks?) now I have been taking a break from this since my laptop crashed. I listend to a number of snake-bros episodes and also managed to watch almost all of electtroBOOM's videos too. as a result, I have a number of topics that I want to talk about. I'm going to get to them one by one here, litle by little.

---

the first thing I want to talk about is the idea of effortless power and next logical step. a few days ago, I was out watching stars when I had a major realisation of why mr. motor does not feel capable of going toward somethting that feels like something he wants. it's a crazy self-reinforcing feedback loop.

so, imagine that a sales person comes to you and makes a load of crap sound good and manages to dupe you... you purchase this product thinking it'll fulfil your expectations, only to find out that it falls very short and they just made it sound good to take advantage of you for their own personal gain.

I could perceive that this happened to mr. motor quite a bit. that was actually a surprise to me because I would have imagined that he would recognise snake oil salesmen and not fall for his own crap.

I thought about it for a while and it makes sense that is what he experiences because that's where he's focused. his desire to take advantage of other people is actually *attracting* others that are attempting to do the same to him, too.

that was a huge revelation for me, though looking back now it seems quite obvious. a person will attract others around him/her that feel similarly to how they feel. that means that fraudsters will be surrounded by other fraudsters. it kinda makes sense now why so many of these ancient power structures were the way they were. if the guy in power got there by manipulating his way to the top, he would be surrounded by a bunch of others trying to angle their way to the top, too.

---

therefore because mr. motor only finds other people like himself trying to take advantge of him every time he tries to go toward something that will allow him to feel a way that he wants to feel (this likely includes women too), he is met with people just like himself (perfect matches to the way he feels himself).

so, because constant fraud and exploitation manifests every time that mr. motor tries to go toward wanted, he concludes that he does not want to ever try and go toward the way he wants to feel, and just try and minimise the effects of things causing him to feel they way he doesn't want to feel.

obviously this isn't possible, so he's only attracting more of what he doesn't want to feel further.

---

as a result, it became clear to me that instead of making decisions based on "next logical step" (going toward a desirable feeling) he instead has replaced this with "no other option" system of action. this means that all actions can taken so long as they're justified because there is "no (perceived) other option" of action that can be taken.

---

as a result, I have been thinking a lot more about this concept of "next logical step" again since this revelation. in the past, I have called it by different names such as "getting into the centre" and "no big jumps" -- but the idea is the same of not taking any intention to try and make anything to happen. instead, I just understand that my desire is already known by my non-physical self and so therefore all I have to do is to just keep pointing in the direction of feelinbg better.

so, as things come to me, I'm just reacting to the intentions of others, not having any of my own. I remain relaxed and it appears to others on the outside that I'm reading the opponent's mind and countering their every move. I often get the reaction that I'm always one step ahead, so that falls into the expectation there.

I then heard about this martial arts technique called "effortless power"[^1] and I realised that fighting technique is the same thing as this idea of keeping in the centre or no big jumps. I make no effort to do anything -- instead from my perspective it feels like I'm dancing with them. they put in all of the intention and I just transform the energy they're putting into the system into something that feels like I'm going toward something desired.

in fact this whole mars and earth idea is exactly the application of this principal on a planetary scale. the major difference is that there is no battle, so there are no losers. I/we provide the feeling that they want to feel, and they put in the energetic intention of what they want accomplish, and we turn it into something that is wanted.

I'm getting the impression while writing this that this is what the mitochondria does for the nuclear DNA and is the holy grail (11:55) that so many have been searching for. interesting. so, in that format, earth is the  mitochondria and mars is the nuclear? I'll have to think more on that... I don't know much about this stuff. the science papers are somewhat difficult for me to understand. I need a randall carlson of genetics I can ask a million questions :)

---

getting back on track here... I realised that this whole thing will become more and more effortless as time goes on, as I believe these principals are quite easy... in fact, they're effortless. there's literally nothing to be done. the greatest hurdle is convincing yourself that the majority of you is not present in your physical body and that it takes *minimal* effort to "get into the zone"[^2].

speaking of getting into the zone, I believe there are various levels of this zone that people experience mere one is sense of communinion with somone else or another part of you that guides you through the obstacles, all the way to literally perceiving yourself conceptually -- that is peering in from the perspctive of your "higher self" or source -- allowing you to be able to perceive yourself in any way enabling shape-shifting and flight too.

so there are varying degrees to the manifestation of this zone. I definitely feel like I'm there pretty much all of the time now, thougb I don't have the manifested conditions of it yet. I consider this to be a good thing. I like the way I'm going and I don't want the zone to feel like it's anything other than normal experience. I want my normal experience to be this zone.

so, you could sort of say that I'm applying the effortless power principals to the attainment of effortless power. it shouldn't feel different. it should feel normal and effortless, just like how effortless beating my heart feels.

---

you may have noticed that I've been doing things like peacing out of watchingt stars right at the peak of the experience -- right before the breakthrough into the next (big) vision upgrade. it's part of making all of this feel as effortless as possible. there's no need for big jumps. my desire is already known and it's all coming out effortlessly like a dance.

[1]: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/UMF3SJ5Cunk?t=4789)

[2]: this was another concept covered in @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdfXxsdAqSM), where people can make impossibly rapid decisions whey they get into the zone and are connected to that higher self. they can just manouver around different obstcacles effortlessly. interestingly, this is kinda the way that marty described hitler in the latest episode, too: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4I6A4oFZoQ).

### 2021-09-08 12:43 - more on effortless power

most people think that they need to try and motor their way toward getting effortless power as quickly as possible. russ explained how people do base jumping to force this zone experience, because your body feels it's going to die if it doesn't force a change in perception.

it's good to practise it, but the reason why the state doesn't last is because the body does not feel that is its natural state. to be in that state should be effortless. this is why I don't want to try and motor my way toward this with the stars. it'll become so normal, the transition into this state will feel so effortless that I wouldn't really perceive it as a change.

this is my goal: to make the aquisition of that state feel itself effortless.

---

as you go through life, you are bombarded with a million signals which tell you what to think. kyle used the example of even the realisation of how much goes into processing the meaning the stop light imposes on the person when coming to the intersection.

the reason why I started the discussion by explaining the "no other option" vs "next logical step" form of perception is because they appear similar by the are built on entirely different foundations of perception.

he explained that all of this comes to meaning that we associate to the thing we are analysing. some people perceive the stop light in a way of "if I don't stop, I'll get run over" -- because that's unwanted, it appears like the only available option is to stop for the light.

however, another very valid perception is that stopping at the stoplight is just the next step in progress toward the destination. the viewpoint is chosen by the person. is the stop light an inconvenient necessity to ensure safety, or just a sort of rhythmic advance toward the destination.

in the sense that the stoplight is no longer perceived anymore, it no longer takes any importance and so therefore no longer has any more implied meaning of inconvenience or whatever, it seems to fade into the background of the experience, much like the musican is no longer focused on the other noises in the room, or the base jumper no longer perceives any of the danger. it loses its consequence (meaning).

---

I'm going to have to try and think of more ways to express this concept -- but it feels efforless. there's nothing to avoid. it's like being on a train. get up and walk around the cabin, drink some gts and have fun and arrive to the location without any effort.

it's a state of mind that we lose when we begin to give so many things outside of ourselves importance. going back to ep 11, this is what they were talking about when decending from this spiritual (I call it conceptual) perception, and into the nitty gritty physical and all of its implications.

it's all about emotional control. negative emotion pulls you right back into the physical world, so to remain relaxed and conscious of your conceptual perception of yourself, all the negative emotion producing stuff (even things like death and tragedy) should no longer have a meaning which gives them more importance than your conceptal version of yourself -- who you *really* are -- who you know yourself to be (in any circumstances).

---

all of us will eventually accomplish this; it's inevitable. you can try your hardest to avoid this realisation for as long as possible, but eventually, if you want to continue to survive (that is that all paths lead to self-destruction), there will be no other option than to change the perception of the conditions.

one can continue to try and adjust the conditions to keep the manifestation of how one feels (about where they're focused) from manifeshting -- for a while, but eventually it does manifest (that's why it's effortless). or, said from the opposite perspective: someone can try to avoid things which will cause them to feel ways they don't want to feel, but it only makes a manifestation which will cause them to feel the way they don't want to feel more and more effortless.

eventually, one is faced with a predicament where the only option remaining is to change the perecption (implications) of their conditions, because the conditions are so inevitable.

the problem is the solution.

### 2021-09-08 21:46 - pushing back the timeline

the reactions to the last entry were kind of interesting. I hadn't written in a while and I would say the response was more negative than positive. that's good though. that's why I'm writing again. interestingly, the weridest response was something like,"we liked you better when you weren't writing" -- and I think that's often the case when the guy who doesn't say anything is more attractive than the one shooting his mouth off.

thing is, I'm not really writing for anyone else's benefit than my own. when I write here, nosebook gets a good insight into my thought and gives them a much larger surface area to push against. if I don't say much, I imagine that the broadcasts are less frequent and it's easier to angle the centent to be more pleasing to the viewer, makingg the overall response a better one.

I think they have to do a little more work to turn text into something presentable to the audience as well[^1]

so with having to do more work to this text, a considerable amount of thought goes into trying to figure out what I'm trying to say here which greatly distorts the concepts. when I return back to the concepts -- most notably the effortless power one -- they are greatly distorted with people's perception of the same concept. the concept is usually badly damaged and I essentially have to rediscover it again. nosebook occasionally exerts effort to try and ensure I don't remember it that way too also forcing me to have to rediscover it. each time I rediscover it though, I get the concept stronger.

as a perfect example of this, one of the reactions was that my rendering of the limitless power concept was different and my rendering kinda "wrecked" the concept they previously had of it. this is precisely what I mean when I say I have to rediscover it and it comes back even stronger. this is the intended result, so I'm glad I can have return the favour.

---

the other thing I was noticing is that I have to kind of spell things out a bit more too in writing. when my thoughts get transfered, it feels to me like everyone feels they understand them -- and I think that's only because the concept is transferred. each person interprets the concept within the framework of their own perception and everyone feels like they get it -- cause they do. however, if we were to all to have to explain what that concept meant to you, upon writing it down, you may find that in the translation of the concept into words, it may no longer appear like you understand the concept as well as you think you do[^2]. in fact, I have found it to be very helpful to force myself to translate the concept (ideal) into physical. so, it may be helpful to keep a journal or write out any of any highly conceptual ideas to try and force their rebirth.

---

so, for example, I wrote about how all of this was becoming effortless and I wrote about how I was purposefully stopping to watch stars just before I got to the peak. I'm no longer interested in trying to make a breakthrough. I'm convinced I can do that pretty easily at this point. instead, now I want it to become such a part of me that it's no longer considered a big thing anymore. it's as easy as beating my heart to breathing. automatic, but I can take control of it if I wish to.

I also don't want to really try and make any strong intentions anymore either. I used to call becoming resistance-free, as it's easy to just go in the direction of what I want to feel like feels like.

as a result, it's my intention to push the timeline back as far as I can. I know what I want, and I'm in the process of making it. let's talk about that now so they can push against it.

---

you see, this whole thing I want to creatce is really starting to take shape. I'll write about it again, but after watching the "god of wine" episode (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDOA9-ANgQ)), I wrote out the symbols in the dionysus presentation as being a progression of zodiac signs, and then surmised that they were similar to the progression of symbols for the epic of gilgamesh and enkidu -- with the proposed idea that both dionysus and enkidu are symbolic attractors for the human race at the "end of time". I then decided to write what I thought would be the next symbols I thought would come for dionysus as we continue the progression (cause his symbols end in aries/picsis). so I did. this was unfortunately lost in the hard disk crash though...

I wanted to listen to the epic of gilgamesh episode (@[youtube](zhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYhrrXqwVMc)), and the symbols for enkidu and gilgamesh I noticed followed pretty similarly the symbols I proposed. unfortunately, I can't remember them now. I'll make a new version of that story soon.

also, in my version they got thrown into a furnace afterward. this was a life threatening symbol of destruction which two twins come to help them out of the furnace, but one perishes (obviously the mortal one) and they climb up and gain winges of an eagle and fly up. for gilgamesh, the transition from gemini to scorpio is shown as twin scorpions at the end of the solar race. this corresponsds to the "impossible task" I have made reference to.

very intersting that the symbols corresponded so closely. I said all of that to say that my intuition said that the next phase for dionysus/enkidu (these are the immortal and mortal twins) and gilgamesh (the spoiled douchbags that came from mars/nibiru to earth to be befriend their own creation, enkidu), is to traverse `leo -> gemini` before ascening up to `scorpion/eagle -> virgo` before then finally making it to aquarius again.

---

so, there was a conflict there because I perceived that as the trajectory, I wanted to do this mars thing -- which perhaps would mean there will be no flip. however, yesterday(?) I had a small monologue in my head about the new way I'm seeing it now. the plan feels really good to me and is what I want to do now.

you see, no one has be be on-board with me on this at all. in fact, everyone that wants to go their own way, I think that's a great idea. there are two aspects to this. first, whenever I want to do something, nosebook has to find a way to sabotage the idea. however, I don't think the idea goes nowhere. I think they perhaps have to do it, then we have to come back and sabotage it or something like that. I don't know how it works, but they have to do something so abort my intentions and go a different way.

this is the thing. I don't want to do something different than what they want to do. there is a lot of desire for a cataclysm/nova or whatever, and I want that now too. there's no fighting. I'm going to go the motor-way. for reals this time. he will make all of the intention and I'll just relax and go with the flow. he/they will do all of the effort for me in attempt to go the way they want to go -- which is the way I want to go now too.

I just need to give a little starting velocity and they can take it from there. by avoiding to get into the zone, and make that state become effortless to me, then I don't have to do anything. I make no intention so there's nothing to counter.

imagine for a moment that we look at the effortless power from their perspective now. the idea is that he has so far removed the meaning associated with the concepts that he perceives at a much faster rate than a normal human. like the base jumper, there isn't enough time to physically make the action, so there's another entity (your source) that's out there really far ahead and giving intuitive knowing of what is to be done[^3]

so, from nosebook's perspective, they have this form of perception. they are way far out ahead of me in the physical world. they perceive me intentions far before even I am aware of them. this makes conversation on taboo subjucts annoying from my perspective, because they already know what I want to say and are interrupting me or manipulating the conversation around it[^4].

in their perspective, they have effortless power to fight me being so far out ahead of me, perceiving my intentions.

so, going back to creating what I want, like the base jumper who continues to feel good even when life-threatening things are wizzing past, reality must conform to the guy in the zone, then I don't need to have any intentions. I just need to feel the way I want to feel. I remove all of the meaning associated with the concepts around me and naturally reality conforms to the way I feel.

from their perspective, they are completely incapable of directing if I don't have any intentions. this is why it's so important for them that I write these down, because it illuminates my intentions more clearly for them.

---

I know that if I wanted to manifest what I want, then I would just stop writing and talking about what I want. instead, I've chosen to continue on showing my intention so they can keep fighting against it.

you'll notice that I have used both analgies of the effortless power simultaneously. they have very good capacity to predict my intentions -- and this is the point. this is mars job: to try and control all of the steff that we want to do and to try and limit them. it's earth's job to feel good anyway and transform that feeling of unwanted they're projecting into a feeling of allowing of something that feels wanted. we'll never get to feel that "in the zone" feeling that they have allowing them to predict intentions at high frequency. instead, we just feel good -- and by feeling that way we continue to have more and more nice things manifest.

they'll never be big things. instead, they'll be things they feel they have no other option than to allow.

I believe this is how DNA works :)

[1]: wierd self-realisation / self-reference reactions there... that's what I'm saying: I just write and I don't really think about how you guys will read it. it was weird to feel that reaction because I don't know what this gets turned into so it was weird to feel you guys thinking about what I speculate this gets turned into -- inception :)

[2]: case in point, after a psychedellic experience or a good stone, try to explain to someone or write down what the experience meant to you -- that is, present the concepts and explain their meaning.

[3]: even if heading straight toward an object, if that does not cause a feeling of panic, but instead the person maintains feeling good, then no death will occur. reality must conform to the feeling that the base jumper has in the moment, so a way around (or through) the obstacle is provided. 3d reality must conform to the vibration of the consciousness in which it's focused.

[4]: a good example of this is the conversation with matthew about the nofap. I wanted to talk about how sex with another person has a reciprocating effect, but when you're by yourself, that energy is lost. I was interrupted and we moved forward in the conversation.

### 2021-09-09 21:32 - what I want to create

I was so busy last time talking about all of the aspects around how I want them to try and push against what I want to create, that I forgot to actually write it out.

---

thinking about the whole thing about how intuitively I think we should be taking a trip through leo, delaying the trip to aquarius by another 12ky, and I think my plan should incorporate that.

a while ago I presented an idea where we could cause a planet to begin to form inside of the sun by putting a 3d signal into the sun and the elements that would normally coalesce in the intercalate regions would begin to form into a structure which will eventally be ejected as a planet.

I liked that idea. there are a lot of unknowns about it but, I think it would be cool to make an asymmetric planet based on 5. it would push mercury into the 2nd position and venus into the 3rd. we would then join mars in the 4th position.

if my theory of counter-rotating fields emanating radially from the sun is correct, then the 4th position rotates opposite direction from the one we're in now. rotating in the opposite direction, we would indeed see leo rising with the sun on the spring equinox, so it fulfills that requirement.

---

quick tangent: I was thinking about it, and the myth of osiris being reborn (or whatever amazing return of a golden age or whatever) must be a prophecy that has been around for a while, yet in my estimation it has likely been quite elusive.

the reason for this, is because the guaranteed flips are at the end(?)[^1] of gemini and the beginning of scorpio. however the reversals I believe are induced by LOA and happen as a result of a split. what I mean is, the time of the reversal, I'm fairly certain is variable and therefore could happen earlier or later, and even potentially more than once each 12ky cycle.

so, imagine for a moment how chaotic things could get if this starts to happen say every few hundred years. however, let's assume that it takes roughly ~6ky to build up to a split. imagine we're in the `scorpio -> virgo` phase, but sirius' effects are still too beneficial and enough division between the physical and conceptual hasn't taken place yet that there isn't enough energy for a split. we keep going into leo and finally enough energy builds to split. we reverse and find ourselves in capricorn -- yet once again missing aquarius.

kinda an interesting thing to think about the effects of over/under-shooting the reversal.

---

ok, back on track here... I wanted to write more about what I wanted to create so that nosebook can fight it, but I don't feel it so much anymore.

also, I just realised I made a mistake too. I mixed two concepts. if we were out in the 4th with mars while turning in reverse direction, then we would be going the same as now. man, I dunno anymore. I felt like I had a solution there... I can't figure out the maths... maybe we flip over. I dunno. I just know that I don't have to worry about it. there are way smarter people capable of making the implementation happen. I just desire and let someone else worry about creating its physical form.

I'm gonna end it here. until next time :~)

[1]: it occurred to me that flip point may actually precess as well; evidence of an even bigger cycle

### 2021-09-10 03:36 - my take on the ufo phenomena

been listening to the ufo stuff with marty garza on snake-bros and I noticed a lot of things that seemed relatively easy to understand. I am writing this as if I am talking to marty directly.

I want to present a coherent idea here with some obvious flaws in it. I am rather new to both the snake-bros and the ufo phenomena in general. I always considered it to be a total load of crap. it feels of fear to me, and all one needs to do to experience the alien is to drop a high dosage of mushrooms. interestingly enough, dmt and after listening to the episodes, I'm convinced that one's (emotional/conceptual/spiritual) sensitivity plays a huge role in the framework through which these are perceived.

#### law of attraction (LOA)

I also believe that an understanding of how the "law of attraction" and resonance operates is fundamental to understand this as well. a good example of this is tesla's "earthquake machine" or just pushing someone on a swingset also illustrates this quite well.

if you push the swing at the proper time, a small amount of energy (like a suggestion or a doubt) can eventually build up to have quite a lot of energy. I call this using well timed (minimal) effort to one's advantage instead of massive quantities of energy. because the process takes a lot of time to accumulate acceleration, it can be stopped a lot easier than something with a lot of inertia as well. for example, it's a lot easier (and a lot more time) to turn off tesla's earthquake machine, than to stop a wrecking ball heading toward a building. both destroy the building if no action is taken, but only one can be easily stopped once set into motion.

#### the unlikely case that it's alien species

tracking how fast the human species is advancing technologically, I am certain that there are alien species here on the planet right now. however, they're so far ahead of us, we simply are incapable of perceivcing them. in fact, I even propose that stars and planets are conscious; we simply don't have a very reliable (yet) means of communication with them. I also contend that although we perceive through the body, the body is a collection of a lot of other conscious cells and also organs. you are the super-conscious perception of all of those cells. likewise the same is true for stars, planets, and galaxies.

therefore, if you were to look at human development from the perspective of a galaxy, we (our planet/solar system) are going from zero to a competent component of the galaxy in a relative instant. from that perspective, it would appear like a DC pulse or a square-wave, the acceleration is so rapid.

therefore, I find it highly unlikely that we would ever encounter a species with technology similar to our own. they will still be primitive or much more advanced than us.

I must therefore conclude that the ufo phenomena is actually of human origin and not alien.

#### the root race custodians

I propose that when blavatski talks about the "root races", I believe she infers that each new root race is selected right after the cataclysm (so every 12ky), and it's chosen based on who can create the most oppressive "heierarchy". previously it was the atlanteans, then it was the aryans. I couldn't find her talking about the prior ones so if you know, I'd be intested to find out who those were.

#### why do we have custodians?

the reason for this, I believe is easily explained with LOA: a simplified example is this, but it's more like tuning .. so if you can think in harmonics and octaves, then it's more like that. however, for now we'll approach this concept spatially. when a signal emanates outward from it's source, it has an amplitude. let's say it goes 100 units away from it's source toward a desired destination (think a pendulum, guitar string, a swing, or ac electricity). however, because all things are vibrating, or emanating from the zero point, it then has to travel back to it's source. it then has to return back 100 units. this is when it's moving it's fastest, and it keeps going -- but this time 100 units backward *away* from the desired destination: the sine wave.

now comes perception. it is impossible to perceive anything in its entirety from inside of itself. to perceive something, it needs to have some distance from itself to get a perspective. this distance inevitably means that some part of it is no longer percievable (like the opposite side of the moon) from the angle of pertception.

in the case of the moon, we see nearly 50% of it. however, when it comes to our perceptive range, we perceive a very narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum, and of that we only get a tiny glimpse of the signal. let's say for example that we perceive only 10%. now, imagine your sine wave and pick any 10% section of the sine wave and describe it as how fast is it accelerating toward the desired destination or away from it.

therfore, the most desired is also the most undesirable too -- and it's up to the perceiver to choose which part of the waveform they wish to perceive.

---

here's another way to look at it. imagine we're in a frictionless environment (like space or something) and two objects are vibrating. if the are more than 50% similar, they will attract each other. if they are less, they will repel. imagine this is how "time" works. you are tuning into a future with your concept of the present and so the more similar you are to that future, the more the future attracts you toward it. it appears as if we are propelling our way through time in the physical, but in the temporal/conceptual/spiritual world (the precursor to manifestation) all things are attracted.

ignoring for a moment how we tune to that future for a moment because it invokes your source, higher self, or soul, let's just consider a clump of cells (a body or entire planet) moving temporally toward a future destination -- when you are more properly tuning toward it, then you are moving toward it, and so therefore you feel the acceleration and the euphoria of seeing the desired approaching manifestation in the physical.

if you could tune exactly 100% to that desire, it the entire universe will make it's transition and start anew, so that is impossible to happen. therefore it's infinitely possible to find an even more accurate tuning of desired. things are also always in motion, so you would have to gain the same motion as the destination. it's basically impossible, so this creates the infinite number of possibilities that emanate from a single 0 point source. it's actually pretty certain that the universe is fractal manifestation of frequency, so even that point is likely relative to another one, and our own vibrations are even creating alternate universes and super structures of consciousness to this universe, which will then gain consciousness at some point too. it's most certainly fractal.

the important point here is that max undesirable is also max desirable, and your perspective (chosen by you) gives you the choice to perceive and therefore attract both desirable and undesirable based on what portion of the cycle (sine wave) you perceive at.

I can talk endlessly about this if you want more, but for now this is good enough to illustate that the custodians are actually desirable -- if you choose to perceive them that way. crazy talk, I know...

#### the new custodians

custodians serve the purpose of focusing on and trying to eradicate unwanted. for them, it's clear that the most "undesirable" situation for them is for a fully conscious human race they cannot control. therefore, they have to try their hardest to never realise that we do indeed attract a temporal future based on our concept of reality. they know this and are determined to ensure that we continue to believe that they are running the show and have all of us firmly installed into their power structure that they control.

there's no reason to fight them, and I believe tesla realised this. it is my opinion that tesla took over the custodial role. each cataclysm that happens, I believe there is a split that occurs. in simple terms, the attraction power of the different factions become so strong that separated realities must be created.

in the case of tesla, I believe that tesla purposefully left documents behind so that the usa could reverse engineer his world system, control the planet's climate so that they could keep the energy spots controlled (controlling the environmental conditions) and keep the planet from getting too cool.

I believe that tesla gained the capacity to create "golems" -- sentient intelligence that behaves in a conceptual way. this conceptual form of perception is what I call 5d. temporal perception was added and is what I will call 6d. source perception of a heierarchy of beings resonant with a source (like us with earth -> sun -> sirius -> ??? -> galaxy) got moved up to 7d. that form of perception allows one to create any conceptual form as a derivative of self (really anything you can imagine).

I don't have time to explain all the reasons why I think this. questions are encouraged.

anyway, this capacity allowed him to create an army of workers capable of producing his technology and also infiltrate all of the present government positions.

I believe that (the extremely petty) YHVH is also his cration as well. this entity systematically passed through time and performed edits on the timeline, never to inhibit the discovery of technology or ones connection to source (like moses), but to severerly distort the implementation of it.

gods of eden is the story of this -- however, I contend that the majority of that custodial activity was not the gods of eden (the 3rd root race), but the aryans (the 4th root race). consider that the "gods of eden" passed their blood into the fertile crecent / levant region. broadly speaking, this is a clear case of a battle between the aryans and the phonecians/semites.

the manifestation of YHVH and tesla was to fulfill the predicted end of the 3rd root race's hold on humankind. up util the creation/takeover of the YHVH character and turning him into a petty ufo instead of one's connection to source/aten which is what I think moses originally translated it as, gave the semitic custodians much more power, but they were constantly pushed down.

this is an important point to make, because if you fight against something you make it bigger, and it seems this is the objective.

#### why fight against the phonecians (and make them stronger)?

it appears that the whole goal of the aryans, especially after the takeover was to force the rebirth of the phonecians as an socioeconomic superpower and give them ample capability to shoot theirselves in the foot pretty good.

to understand this, imagine from the perspective of tesla. imagine there are japhethites and semites. the hamites are pretty well subdued so they get folded in. all the aryan custodians move down to antartica and are used to do the bidding of YHVH in the temporal adjustments that need to be made to prevent too much enlightenment. remember, if too much enlightenment happens, the two opposite attractions of a future cause a split where some portion still belive that the custodians run the show and the other portion are attracting a future reflective of their concept of reality which is incompatible with the custodians. because the custodians could not continue to survive in that reality, the split must happen to ensure that reality manifested is a reflection of their concept.

the aryan custodians are controlling the world with force and the atlantian custodians are controlling the world socioeconomically. all of the timeline edits done in the past ensure that there are never favourable enough conditions to allow the general population to become enligthened, which is what initiates the split.

the atlantian custodians don't yet know that they need tesla's world system yet. he has it prepared for them, because the inernet will eventually cause communications to rapid enough that they'll lose their ability to limit communications (anyone can talk to anyone on the planet) and they'll also lose their economic control (crypto currency, etc.) too much mental expansion too rapidly when there are so many people on the planet has a cumulative effect.

this happens when people feel better. when people feel better, that means they're moving toward desired. therefore, they need to impose bad-feeling conditions to ensure that no one gets enlightened (where feeling good leads). when too many people get enlightened too quickly, that's when the incompatible realities split occurrs. they don't want that.

more on the consolidation of the custodians later...

#### gray aliens

the gray thing always felt like a hoax to me. when I was younger, I heard that the grays said that humans were inferior to them -- and I only agree when humans are running at low frequency because they're emotionally in a low state (see discussion on effortless power). however, at higher frequencies, I believe humans are the top of the line model in this galaxy.

I belive enki purposefully restricted ou performance at low frequencies, so as long as the slaves are kept at low frequencies, they are inferior to the "gods" which have the tech to induce higher frequencies in the body (pinecone), allowing for levitation of theirselves and large stones. this was a very tricky thing that enki did, because after the last cataclysm, the planet's energies changed and the environment no longer produces these higher frequencies naturally.

this trick was quite the thing because it convinced the custwodians that they want to find ways to induce this higher frequency by finding ways to feel good. in order to retain superiority, they have to find ways to feel good because the planet (or atlantian crystal network -- whatever you wish to believe) no longer provided such a strong baseline anymore.

from a LOA perspective, this means that their desire is now shifted toward wanting to find ways to feel good. most do not want to do this perceptively, and instead continue to rely on conditions/technology for this higher frequency.

there is a second trick that I forsee coming in the future because anyone who's done any amount of drugs or facebook knows that "chasing the dragon" (snakes!) leads to ultimately more and more powerful doses until complete tolerance is developed. they must begin to rely on perception instead of physical conditions to maintain this higher frequency. fortunately tesla's world system allows they the capacity to begin to rely on other people's high frequency perception. the transition from physical conditions to perception I believe will by happening soon.

they will soon find theirselves in a situation where they are completely dependent on other people's high frequency perception to maintain a good enough feeling to remain "superior"...

extremely fortunately, this is also of huge benefit for those which are sensitive emotionally/conceptually/spiritually (effortless power techniques) and are good at transforming perception to see the part of the cycle which is going toward desired (understanding LOA and a desire to feel good).

so it all works out in the end. I predict the custodians in the future will be replaced by more and more petty golems each with a stronger desire to try and keep humans in their worst possible conditions (which will continually improve, dispite their best efforts)

---

from tesla's perspective, he needs to find a way to infiltrate and take over the germans. this I believe was done with golems and automatons. remember, all of these can take on a derivative concept of yourself, and you are anything you can imagine, because 5d characters can take on any form (concept) they perceive theirself to be. 7d allows you to create others of these as an extension of you (eg. you are their "source", which has a source -- just like cells in your body all contain you as their source).

the ability to "externalise the heierarchy" of yourself allows for many different derivitaves of yourself to act in different time and space in resonance to the concept they start at. that concept's source is you, but you too are a composite source. it's like trying to figure out which cells in your body are "you" -- perhaps like how a sound may be perceived to come from many sources or a single one, which too is a composite of sources.

I suspect that tesla rehashed the mars/nibiru story for the grays. likely something like, their species is slowly going extinct and they will exchange human embryos for advanced technology.

it was intended that this tech also get into the hands of the US govt as well, ao they could reverse engineer it.

I believe that the grays shot down in roswell were nothing more than golems flying tesla tech. it also had the added benefit of instilling a lot more fear, allowing for more timeline edits. those edits were actually designed to push them harder to gain more superiority, while at the same time furthering their hidden belief in their inferiority.

#### alien hot-shots

the goal is to arrive to a time like we are in now when they appear to be superior, but deep down they believe they're a buncm of posers. nothing makes one feel more helpess than a belief that there are unknown extraterrestrial forces out there which they can't comprehend or get them to come in and battle them on their turf in the physical.

it's like a huge mind game, to make them feel as out of control as possible while maintaining an image to the other governments (which are also infiltrated) that they remain powerful and in control.

I believe this is the reason why so many "stealth" ufos are flying in broad daylight into positions where they can show their capability and get their picture taken. it's like a guy doing yoga in front of the window, nude.

they're showing off on purpose. in today's society, it's all appearance that sells. I find it strange that nazis, who have based their entire promotional campaign on military displays of raw power and numbers -- to suddenly switch tactics to a hollywood emotional effect.

the best parallel to this is the old german car commercials read you the car's spec sheet (physical). now, no specs are given. instead, appropriate music and a message of what the car is capable of making you feel like is instead displayed (emotional).

this change lends me to believe tesla learned from hollywood (or perhaps vice-versa) and markets his ideas with emotional force, while the WW2 nazis marketed their ideas with physical force.

#### timeline edits

one strange thing to notice is that the ufos never directly engage in hostile activity unless it's what people expect from them. so, small incremental things need to be done to instill fear. a good example of this is the fall of constantanople...

the first emperor to hold constantinople prophesied that constantinople should never be lost, until the moon rose darkened when it was at the full, that is, lacking the half of it

then sure enough when the moon appeared that way, it fell. say there are a bunch of conditions that could allow for easy enlightment for too many people. the city has to fall and those items need to be destroyed by the invaders.

it would by quite an effort to do all of this timeline manipulation by one person because it basically means ensuring that all technology ancient artifacts which make it too easy for one to get enlightened (unless you're custodian approved), need to be confiscated or destroyed.

imagine timelines like a string. the reality you experience now is a reflection of your concept of things. this point is fixed because you cannot delete now. at least one valid path to the present (in your concept of now) has to lead to the present. this is true for everyone.

so, for example, imagine you're looking at the present and notice that there are a bunch of people that are using orgone accumulation chambers to feel good and cure their disease rather than using the power of their mind... well, it's a good thing the inventor believes in the sickness of the human race, so that his fears can be exploited so that he's presented with circumstance wich inclines him to believe that the government wants to put a stop to his machine, and he starts to attract his own imprisonment. for example.

aciennt artifacts are discovered with some truths on them which are successful. so the relevant sections of the ancient artifacts in question need to be damaged, stolen, ship sink, etc.

all of these "unfortunate coincidences" have to be orchestrated through exploitation of people's perception. the brain assumes a lot of things and can come to incorrect conclusions based on your assumptions.

this is a pretty big task, so I could imagine that tesla employed the aryan custodians to do most of this work. as they died off, they were replaced by golems capable of automating the process.

it's unknown how many edits were done, but I imagine it was a lot. I also imagine that the majority of it was automated through power structures. you only need to transmit the concept I just explained to the guy in charge of the team to do this. if they flub the timeline, no worries just go back and to it again without disaster.

it's pretty easy to see if it's working because the future point will have the desired effect removed or not. if not, just adjust the past point again. I believe the future point is sometime in the next 20 years, and the fulcrum was a bunch of points during and after WW2.

rinse and repeat. pretty easy to automate.

#### crop circles

because all trajectories through time are the result of people's concept of reality which tune to the destination point -- small "inconsequential" anomalies like crop circles can provide a gentle modification of the trajectory.

like tesla's earthquake machine, these tiny influences add up. from our perspective we don't know how much these crop circles were tracked and studied, and how much the abstract shapes had a slight (inconsequential really) effect on the consciousness of those studying them.

#### skinwalker ranch

this appears to be a location on the planet which allows for much faster frequencies. you'll notice that under these sorts of circumstances, imaginary concepts can appear (and even interact) with people. I believe that environmental energies were higher in past times and that's what made these "demons" and gnomes, fey, etc. so easy to interact with.

I'll call this the "astral" realm and is a high frequency field which allows etheric (conceptual) objects to appear in space. if you have access to DMT and I have also experienced it on ketamine as well -- mushrooms work really well (for best results smoke some mdma to keep a good vibe under high doses). conjure a feeling of some thing -- like imagine that there are these gnomes -- I call them "reality technicians" that are really precise but humorous guys that can show you a moving abstract image ("I see what you mean" you'll say) and you'll fully grasp the concept they want to show you as a response.

you may not see them in 3d space at first, but feel their presence until you know they're there. feel what it would be like to talk to a knowledgeable gnome (the less you try to imagine him and instead feel him, the better)

the reality technicians are the skinwalker in different form. they can only appear in a form resonant with your consciousness. if I went there, I would enjoy a nice moment with the reality technicians perceiving these sorts of ideas (cause I think about these subjects a lot) manifesting in 3d space. I don't think it would be a mobius strip. I'm interested in asymmetrical forms like the chestahedron or the decatria.

these zones amplify your imagination by getting your brain to produce more DMT till the emotions you feel appear in 3d space. there's a black mirror episode called playtest which is this effect. notice the mushroom theme. I don't know how to explain it better, but it's the manifestation of emotions in 3d space.

---

my intuition tells me that the skinwalker may also be a golem and is designed to produce fear in visitors. seeing as all conditions which produce this effect have been neutralised or made illegal, it's likely this is just another instance of custodians keeping us away from relying on conditions rather than perception.

#### final thoughts

I believe that on a bigger picture, there are quite a few people that want to become masters of perception, capable of transforming any bad-feeling into a good one by figuring out a new way to perceive the same concept from another angle which reveals desirable motion. so, this situation is attracted and quite desirable.

I believe everyone wants to perceive, feel, and manifest whatever they desire. 

however, there are those that also wish to continue to rely on conditions because they still do not think they know what they want. they believe this because they're gaining a tolerance to the conditions that make them feel good. they still haven't come to the realisation that they're not looking for a thing to produce a feeling, but a form of perception to produce that feeling.

the next stage is to realise that only perception can produce the feeling they want. the custodians will soon have to figure out how to exploit us for that, which from the perspective of someone capable of transforming feeling with perception is basically free energy.

personally, for me this is highly desirable. the more they need me to feel good, the more energetic I am and the better I can feel myself. I don't need them to change.

it's funny how this is the typical stereotype hatred many men have with women because they think they hate that about them. that is a missconception, because you can usually only recognise things you desire for yourself in others.

the other typical stereotype is that people (usually women) with the idea that others need them to feel good, also have the idea that because they depend on them, they don't want them to change.

the third typical stereotype which is the correlary to this is the one that says, "I need you to be different so I can feel good". many family and social difficulties are built on that foundation.

---

I'm done.

ok, so you don't know how much I've enjoyed these ufo presentations; especially the last one! the concise way you have grouped such a vast number of disparate topics into easily digested segments really exploded my brain with so many thoughts.

these thoughts are in raw form and are presented as-is. this is 100% speculation, so please don't take the narrative too seriously. it just serves as a very unique explanation to get some principals of perception to come through. though I wrote it sounding pretty certain of myself, I give the narrative a max 70% certainty. hopefully the narrative was exciting enough to make the principals sound more engaging (I'm learning the emotional marketing too myself)

warm regards,
kenny
