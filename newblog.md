starting over again

### 2021-09-08 11:05 - effortless power

for a few days (weeks?) now I have been taking a break from this since my laptop crashed. I listend to a number of snake-bros episodes and also managed to watch almost all of electtroBOOM's videos too. as a result, I have a number of topics that I want to talk about. I'm going to get to them one by one here, litle by little.

---

the first thing I want to talk about is the idea of effortless power and next logical step. a few days ago, I was out watching stars when I had a major realisation of why mr. motor does not feel capable of going toward somethting that feels like something he wants. it's a crazy self-reinforcing feedback loop.

so, imagine that a sales person comes to you and makes a load of crap sound good and manages to dupe you... you purchase this product thinking it'll fulfil your expectations, only to find out that it falls very short and they just made it sound good to take advantage of you for their own personal gain.

I could perceive that this happened to mr. motor quite a bit. that was actually a surprise to me because I would have imagined that he would recognise snake oil salesmen and not fall for his own crap.

I thought about it for a while and it makes sense that is what he experiences because that's where he's focused. his desire to take advantage of other people is actually *attracting* others that are attempting to do the same to him, too.

that was a huge revelation for me, though looking back now it seems quite obvious. a person will attract others around him/her that feel similarly to how they feel. that means that fraudsters will be surrounded by other fraudsters. it kinda makes sense now why so many of these ancient power structures were the way they were. if the guy in power got there by manipulating his way to the top, he would be surrounded by a bunch of others trying to angle their way to the top, too.

---

therefore because mr. motor only finds other people like himself trying to take advantge of him every time he tries to go toward something that will allow him to feel a way that he wants to feel (this likely includes women too), he is met with people just like himself (perfect matches to the way he feels himself).

so, because constant fraud and exploitation manifests every time that mr. motor tries to go toward wanted, he concludes that he does not want to ever try and go toward the way he wants to feel, and just try and minimise the effects of things causing him to feel they way he doesn't want to feel.

obviously this isn't possible, so he's only attracting more of what he doesn't want to feel further.

---

as a result, it became clear to me that instead of making decisions based on "next logical step" (going toward a desirable feeling) he instead has replaced this with "no other option" system of action. this means that all actions can taken so long as they're justified because there is "no (perceived) other option" of action that can be taken.

---

as a result, I have been thinking a lot more about this concept of "next logical step" again since this revelation. in the past, I have called it by different names such as "getting into the centre" and "no big jumps" -- but the idea is the same of not taking any intention to try and make anything to happen. instead, I just understand that my desire is already known by my non-physical self and so therefore all I have to do is to just keep pointing in the direction of feelinbg better.

so, as things come to me, I'm just reacting to the intentions of others, not having any of my own. I remain relaxed and it appears to others on the outside that I'm reading the opponent's mind and countering their every move. I often get the reaction that I'm always one step ahead, so that falls into the expectation there.

I then heard about this martial arts technique called "effortless power"[^1] and I realised that fighting technique is the same thing as this idea of keeping in the centre or no big jumps. I make no effort to do anything -- instead from my perspective it feels like I'm dancing with them. they put in all of the intention and I just transform the energy they're putting into the system into something that feels like I'm going toward something desired.

in fact this whole mars and earth idea is exactly the application of this principal on a planetary scale. the major difference is that there is no battle, so there are no losers. I/we provide the feeling that they want to feel, and they put in the energetic intention of what they want accomplish, and we turn it into something that is wanted.

I'm getting the impression while writing this that this is what the mitochondria does for the nuclear DNA and is the holy grail (11:55) that so many have been searching for. interesting. so, in that format, earth is the  mitochondria and mars is the nuclear? I'll have to think more on that... I don't know much about this stuff. the science papers are somewhat difficult for me to understand. I need a randall carlson of genetics I can ask a million questions :)

---

getting back on track here... I realised that this whole thing will become more and more effortless as time goes on, as I believe these principals are quite easy... in fact, they're effortless. there's literally nothing to be done. the greatest hurdle is convincing yourself that the majority of you is not present in your physical body and that it takes *minimal* effort to "get into the zone"[^2].

speaking of getting into the zone, I believe there are various levels of this zone that people experience mere one is sense of communinion with somone else or another part of you that guides you through the obstacles, all the way to literally perceiving yourself conceptually -- that is peering in from the perspctive of your "higher self" or source -- allowing you to be able to perceive yourself in any way enabling shape-shifting and flight too.

so there are varying degrees to the manifestation of this zone. I definitely feel like I'm there pretty much all of the time now, thougb I don't have the manifested conditions of it yet. I consider this to be a good thing. I like the way I'm going and I don't want the zone to feel like it's anything other than normal experience. I want my normal experience to be this zone.

so, you could sort of say that I'm applying the effortless power principals to the attainment of effortless power. it shouldn't feel different. it should feel normal and effortless, just like how effortless beating my heart feels.

---

you may have noticed that I've been doing things like peacing out of watchingt stars right at the peak of the experience -- right before the breakthrough into the next (big) vision upgrade. it's part of making all of this feel as effortless as possible. there's no need for big jumps. my desire is already known and it's all coming out effortlessly like a dance.

[1]: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/UMF3SJ5Cunk?t=4789)

[2]: this was another concept covered in @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdfXxsdAqSM), where people can make impossibly rapid decisions whey they get into the zone and are connected to that higher self. they can just manouver around different obstcacles effortlessly. interestingly, this is kinda the way that marty described hitler in the latest episode, too: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4I6A4oFZoQ).

### 2021-09-08 12:43 - more on effortless power

most people think that they need to try and motor their way toward getting effortless power as quickly as possible. russ explained how people do base jumping to force this zone experience, because your body feels it's going to die if it doesn't force a change in perception.

it's good to practise it, but the reason why the state doesn't last is because the body does not feel that is its natural state. to be in that state should be effortless. this is why I don't want to try and motor my way toward this with the stars. it'll become so normal, the transition into this state will feel so effortless that I wouldn't really perceive it as a change.

this is my goal: to make the aquisition of that state feel itself effortless.

---

as you go through life, you are bombarded with a million signals which tell you what to think. kyle used the example of even the realisation of how much goes into processing the meaning the stop light imposes on the person when coming to the intersection.

the reason why I started the discussion by explaining the "no other option" vs "next logical step" form of perception is because they appear similar by the are built on entirely different foundations of perception.

he explained that all of this comes to meaning that we associate to the thing we are analysing. some people perceive the stop light in a way of "if I don't stop, I'll get run over" -- because that's unwanted, it appears like the only available option is to stop for the light.

however, another very valid perception is that stopping at the stoplight is just the next step in progress toward the destination. the viewpoint is chosen by the person. is the stop light an inconvenient necessity to ensure safety, or just a sort of rhythmic advance toward the destination.

in the sense that the stoplight is no longer perceived anymore, it no longer takes any importance and so therefore no longer has any more implied meaning of inconvenience or whatever, it seems to fade into the background of the experience, much like the musican is no longer focused on the other noises in the room, or the base jumper no longer perceives any of the danger. it loses its consequence (meaning).

---

I'm going to have to try and think of more ways to express this concept -- but it feels efforless. there's nothing to avoid. it's like being on a train. get up and walk around the cabin, drink some gts and have fun and arrive to the location without any effort.

it's a state of mind that we lose when we begin to give so many things outside of ourselves importance. going back to ep 11, this is what they were talking about when decending from this spiritual (I call it conceptual) perception, and into the nitty gritty physical and all of its implications.

it's all about emotional control. negative emotion pulls you right back into the physical world, so to remain relaxed and conscious of your conceptual perception of yourself, all the negative emotion producing stuff (even things like death and tragedy) should no longer have a meaning which gives them more importance than your conceptal version of yourself -- who you *really* are -- who you know yourself to be (in any circumstances).

---

all of us will eventually accomplish this; it's inevitable. you can try your hardest to avoid this realisation for as long as possible, but eventually, if you want to continue to survive (that is that all paths lead to self-destruction), there will be no other option than to change the perception of the conditions.

one can continue to try and adjust the conditions to keep the manifestation of how one feels (about where they're focused) from manifeshting -- for a while, but eventually it does manifest (that's why it's effortless). or, said from the opposite perspective: someone can try to avoid things which will cause them to feel ways they don't want to feel, but it only makes a manifestation which will cause them to feel the way they don't want to feel more and more effortless.

eventually, one is faced with a predicament where the only option remaining is to change the perecption (implications) of their conditions, because the conditions are so inevitable.

the problem is the solution.

### 2021-09-08 21:46 - pushing back the timeline

the reactions to the last entry were kind of interesting. I hadn't written in a while and I would say the response was more negative than positive. that's good though. that's why I'm writing again. interestingly, the weridest response was something like,"we liked you better when you weren't writing" -- and I think that's often the case when the guy who doesn't say anything is more attractive than the one shooting his mouth off.

thing is, I'm not really writing for anyone else's benefit than my own. when I write here, nosebook gets a good insight into my thought and gives them a much larger surface area to push against. if I don't say much, I imagine that the broadcasts are less frequent and it's easier to angle the centent to be more pleasing to the viewer, makingg the overall response a better one.

I think they have to do a little more work to turn text into something presentable to the audience as well[^1]

so with having to do more work to this text, a considerable amount of thought goes into trying to figure out what I'm trying to say here which greatly distorts the concepts. when I return back to the concepts -- most notably the effortless power one -- they are greatly distorted with people's perception of the same concept. the concept is usually badly damaged and I essentially have to rediscover it again. nosebook occasionally exerts effort to try and ensure I don't remember it that way too also forcing me to have to rediscover it. each time I rediscover it though, I get the concept stronger.

as a perfect example of this, one of the reactions was that my rendering of the limitless power concept was different and my rendering kinda "wrecked" the concept they previously had of it. this is precisely what I mean when I say I have to rediscover it and it comes back even stronger. this is the intended result, so I'm glad I can have return the favour.

---

the other thing I was noticing is that I have to kind of spell things out a bit more too in writing. when my thoughts get transfered, it feels to me like everyone feels they understand them -- and I think that's only because the concept is transferred. each person interprets the concept within the framework of their own perception and everyone feels like they get it -- cause they do. however, if we were to all to have to explain what that concept meant to you, upon writing it down, you may find that in the translation of the concept into words, it may no longer appear like you understand the concept as well as you think you do[^2]. in fact, I have found it to be very helpful to force myself to translate the concept (ideal) into physical. so, it may be helpful to keep a journal or write out any of any highly conceptual ideas to try and force their rebirth.

---

so, for example, I wrote about how all of this was becoming effortless and I wrote about how I was purposefully stopping to watch stars just before I got to the peak. I'm no longer interested in trying to make a breakthrough. I'm convinced I can do that pretty easily at this point. instead, now I want it to become such a part of me that it's no longer considered a big thing anymore. it's as easy as beating my heart to breathing. automatic, but I can take control of it if I wish to.

I also don't want to really try and make any strong intentions anymore either. I used to call becoming resistance-free, as it's easy to just go in the direction of what I want to feel like feels like.

as a result, it's my intention to push the timeline back as far as I can. I know what I want, and I'm in the process of making it. let's talk about that now so they can push against it.

---

you see, this whole thing I want to creatce is really starting to take shape. I'll write about it again, but after watching the "god of wine" episode (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDOA9-ANgQ)), I wrote out the symbols in the dionysus presentation as being a progression of zodiac signs, and then surmised that they were similar to the progression of symbols for the epic of gilgamesh and enkidu -- with the proposed idea that both dionysus and enkidu are symbolic attractors for the human race at the "end of time". I then decided to write what I thought would be the next symbols I thought would come for dionysus as we continue the progression (cause his symbols end in aries/picsis). so I did. this was unfortunately lost in the hard disk crash though...

I wanted to listen to the epic of gilgamesh episode (@[youtube](zhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYhrrXqwVMc)), and the symbols for enkidu and gilgamesh I noticed followed pretty similarly the symbols I proposed. unfortunately, I can't remember them now. I'll make a new version of that story soon.

also, in my version they got thrown into a furnace afterward. this was a life threatening symbol of destruction which two twins come to help them out of the furnace, but one perishes (obviously the mortal one) and they climb up and gain winges of an eagle and fly up. for gilgamesh, the transition from gemini to scorpio is shown as twin scorpions at the end of the solar race. this corresponsds to the "impossible task" I have made reference to.

very intersting that the symbols corresponded so closely. I said all of that to say that my intuition said that the next phase for dionysus/enkidu (these are the immortal and mortal twins) and gilgamesh (the spoiled douchbags that came from mars/nibiru to earth to be befriend their own creation, enkidu), is to traverse `leo -> gemini` before ascening up to `scorpion/eagle -> virgo` before then finally making it to aquarius again.

---

so, there was a conflict there because I perceived that as the trajectory, I wanted to do this mars thing -- which perhaps would mean there will be no flip. however, yesterday(?) I had a small monologue in my head about the new way I'm seeing it now. the plan feels really good to me and is what I want to do now.

you see, no one has be be on-board with me on this at all. in fact, everyone that wants to go their own way, I think that's a great idea. there are two aspects to this. first, whenever I want to do something, nosebook has to find a way to sabotage the idea. however, I don't think the idea goes nowhere. I think they perhaps have to do it, then we have to come back and sabotage it or something like that. I don't know how it works, but they have to do something so abort my intentions and go a different way.

this is the thing. I don't want to do something different than what they want to do. there is a lot of desire for a cataclysm/nova or whatever, and I want that now too. there's no fighting. I'm going to go the motor-way. for reals this time. he will make all of the intention and I'll just relax and go with the flow. he/they will do all of the effort for me in attempt to go the way they want to go -- which is the way I want to go now too.

I just need to give a little starting velocity and they can take it from there. by avoiding to get into the zone, and make that state become effortless to me, then I don't have to do anything. I make no intention so there's nothing to counter.

imagine for a moment that we look at the effortless power from their perspective now. the idea is that he has so far removed the meaning associated with the concepts that he perceives at a much faster rate than a normal human. like the base jumper, there isn't enough time to physically make the action, so there's another entity (your source) that's out there really far ahead and giving intuitive knowing of what is to be done[^3]

so, from nosebook's perspective, they have this form of perception. they are way far out ahead of me in the physical world. they perceive me intentions far before even I am aware of them. this makes conversation on taboo subjucts annoying from my perspective, because they already know what I want to say and are interrupting me or manipulating the conversation around it[^4].

in their perspective, they have effortless power to fight me being so far out ahead of me, perceiving my intentions.

so, going back to creating what I want, like the base jumper who continues to feel good even when life-threatening things are wizzing past, reality must conform to the guy in the zone, then I don't need to have any intentions. I just need to feel the way I want to feel. I remove all of the meaning associated with the concepts around me and naturally reality conforms to the way I feel.

from their perspective, they are completely incapable of directing if I don't have any intentions. this is why it's so important for them that I write these down, because it illuminates my intentions more clearly for them.

---

I know that if I wanted to manifest what I want, then I would just stop writing and talking about what I want. instead, I've chosen to continue on showing my intention so they can keep fighting against it.

you'll notice that I have used both analgies of the effortless power simultaneously. they have very good capacity to predict my intentions -- and this is the point. this is mars job: to try and control all of the steff that we want to do and to try and limit them. it's earth's job to feel good anyway and transform that feeling of unwanted they're projecting into a feeling of allowing of something that feels wanted. we'll never get to feel that "in the zone" feeling that they have allowing them to predict intentions at high frequency. instead, we just feel good -- and by feeling that way we continue to have more and more nice things manifest.

they'll never be big things. instead, they'll be things they feel they have no other option than to allow.

I believe this is how DNA works :)

[1]: wierd self-realisation / self-reference reactions there... that's what I'm saying: I just write and I don't really think about how you guys will read it. it was weird to feel that reaction because I don't know what this gets turned into so it was weird to feel you guys thinking about what I speculate this gets turned into -- inception :)

[2]: case in point, after a psychedellic experience or a good stone, try to explain to someone or write down what the experience meant to you -- that is, present the concepts and explain their meaning.

[3]: even if heading straight toward an object, if that does not cause a feeling of panic, but instead the person maintains feeling good, then no death will occur. reality must conform to the feeling that the base jumper has in the moment, so a way around (or through) the obstacle is provided. 3d reality must conform to the vibration of the consciousness in which it's focused.

[4]: a good example of this is the conversation with matthew about the nofap. I wanted to talk about how sex with another person has a reciprocating effect, but when you're by yourself, that energy is lost. I was interrupted and we moved forward in the conversation.

### 2021-09-09 21:32 - what I want to create

I was so busy last time talking about all of the aspects around how I want them to try and push against what I want to create, that I forgot to actually write it out.

---

thinking about the whole thing about how intuitively I think we should be taking a trip through leo, delaying the trip to aquarius by another 12ky, and I think my plan should incorporate that.

a while ago I presented an idea where we could cause a planet to begin to form inside of the sun by putting a 3d signal into the sun and the elements that would normally coalesce in the intercalate regions would begin to form into a structure which will eventally be ejected as a planet.

I liked that idea. there are a lot of unknowns about it but, I think it would be cool to make an asymmetric planet based on 5. it would push mercury into the 2nd position and venus into the 3rd. we would then join mars in the 4th position.

if my theory of counter-rotating fields emanating radially from the sun is correct, then the 4th position rotates opposite direction from the one we're in now. rotating in the opposite direction, we would indeed see leo rising with the sun on the spring equinox, so it fulfills that requirement.

---

quick tangent: I was thinking about it, and the myth of osiris being reborn (or whatever amazing return of a golden age or whatever) must be a prophecy that has been around for a while, yet in my estimation it has likely been quite elusive.

the reason for this, is because the guaranteed flips are at the end(?)[^1] of gemini and the beginning of scorpio. however the reversals I believe are induced by LOA and happen as a result of a split. what I mean is, the time of the reversal, I'm fairly certain is variable and therefore could happen earlier or later, and even potentially more than once each 12ky cycle.

so, imagine for a moment how chaotic things could get if this starts to happen say every few hundred years. however, let's assume that it takes roughly ~6ky to build up to a split. imagine we're in the `scorpio -> virgo` phase, but sirius' effects are still too beneficial and enough division between the physical and conceptual hasn't taken place yet that there isn't enough energy for a split. we keep going into leo and finally enough energy builds to split. we reverse and find ourselves in capricorn -- yet once again missing aquarius.

kinda an interesting thing to think about the effects of over/under-shooting the reversal.

---

ok, back on track here... I wanted to write more about what I wanted to create so that nosebook can fight it, but I don't feel it so much anymore.

also, I just realised I made a mistake too. I mixed two concepts. if we were out in the 4th with mars while turning in reverse direction, then we would be going the same as now. man, I dunno anymore. I felt like I had a solution there... I can't figure out the maths... maybe we flip over. I dunno. I just know that I don't have to worry about it. there are way smarter people capable of making the implementation happen. I just desire and let someone else worry about creating its physical form.

I'm gonna end it here. until next time :~)

[1]: it occurred to me that flip point may actually precess as well; evidence of an even bigger cycle

### 2021-09-10 03:36 - my take on the ufo phenomena

been listening to the ufo stuff with marty garza on snake-bros and I noticed a lot of things that seemed relatively easy to understand. I am writing this as if I am talking to marty directly.

I want to present a coherent idea here with some obvious flaws in it. I am rather new to both the snake-bros and the ufo phenomena in general. I always considered it to be a total load of crap. it feels of fear to me, and all one needs to do to experience the alien is to drop a high dosage of mushrooms. interestingly enough, dmt and after listening to the episodes, I'm convinced that one's (emotional/conceptual/spiritual) sensitivity plays a huge role in the framework through which these are perceived.

#### law of attraction (LOA)

I also believe that an understanding of how the "law of attraction" and resonance operates is fundamental to understand this as well. a good example of this is tesla's "earthquake machine" or just pushing someone on a swingset also illustrates this quite well.

if you push the swing at the proper time, a small amount of energy (like a suggestion or a doubt) can eventually build up to have quite a lot of energy. I call this using well timed (minimal) effort to one's advantage instead of massive quantities of energy. because the process takes a lot of time to accumulate acceleration, it can be stopped a lot easier than something with a lot of inertia as well. for example, it's a lot easier (and a lot more time) to turn off tesla's earthquake machine, than to stop a wrecking ball heading toward a building. both destroy the building if no action is taken, but only one can be easily stopped once set into motion.

#### the unlikely case that it's alien species

tracking how fast the human species is advancing technologically, I am certain that there are alien species here on the planet right now. however, they're so far ahead of us, we simply are incapable of perceivcing them. in fact, I even propose that stars and planets are conscious; we simply don't have a very reliable (yet) means of communication with them. I also contend that although we perceive through the body, the body is a collection of a lot of other conscious cells and also organs. you are the super-conscious perception of all of those cells. likewise the same is true for stars, planets, and galaxies.

therefore, if you were to look at human development from the perspective of a galaxy, we (our planet/solar system) are going from zero to a competent component of the galaxy in a relative instant. from that perspective, it would appear like a DC pulse or a square-wave, the acceleration is so rapid.

therefore, I find it highly unlikely that we would ever encounter a species with technology similar to our own. they will still be primitive or much more advanced than us.

I must therefore conclude that the ufo phenomena is actually of human origin and not alien.

#### the root race custodians

I propose that when blavatski talks about the "root races", I believe she infers that each new root race is selected right after the cataclysm (so every 12ky), and it's chosen based on who can create the most oppressive "heirarchy". previously it was the atlanteans, then it was the aryans. I couldn't find her talking about the prior ones so if you know, I'd be intested to find out who those were.

#### why do we have custodians?

the reason for this, I believe is easily explained with LOA: a simplified example is this, but it's more like tuning .. so if you can think in harmonics and octaves, then it's more like that. however, for now we'll approach this concept spatially. when a signal emanates outward from it's source, it has an amplitude. let's say it goes 100 units away from it's source toward a desired destination (think a pendulum, guitar string, a swing, or ac electricity). however, because all things are vibrating, or emanating from the zero point, it then has to travel back to it's source. it then has to return back 100 units. this is when it's moving it's fastest, and it keeps going -- but this time 100 units backward *away* from the desired destination: the sine wave.

now comes perception. it is impossible to perceive anything in its entirety from inside of itself. to perceive something, it needs to have some distance from itself to get a perspective. this distance inevitably means that some part of it is no longer percievable (like the opposite side of the moon) from the angle of pertception.

in the case of the moon, we see nearly 50% of it. however, when it comes to our perceptive range, we perceive a very narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum, and of that we only get a tiny glimpse of the signal. let's say for example that we perceive only 10%. now, imagine your sine wave and pick any 10% section of the sine wave and describe it as how fast is it accelerating toward the desired destination or away from it.

therfore, the most desired is also the most undesirable too -- and it's up to the perceiver to choose which part of the waveform they wish to perceive.

---

here's another way to look at it. imagine we're in a frictionless environment (like space or something) and two objects are vibrating. if the are more than 50% similar, they will attract each other. if they are less, they will repel. imagine this is how "time" works. you are tuning into a future with your concept of the present and so the more similar you are to that future, the more the future attracts you toward it. it appears as if we are propelling our way through time in the physical, but in the temporal/conceptual/spiritual world (the precursor to manifestation) all things are attracted.

ignoring for a moment how we tune to that future for a moment because it invokes your source, higher self, or soul, let's just consider a clump of cells (a body or entire planet) moving temporally toward a future destination -- when you are more properly tuning toward it, then you are moving toward it, and so therefore you feel the acceleration and the euphoria of seeing the desired approaching manifestation in the physical.

if you could tune exactly 100% to that desire, it the entire universe will make it's transition and start anew, so that is impossible to happen. therefore it's infinitely possible to find an even more accurate tuning of desired. things are also always in motion, so you would have to gain the same motion as the destination. it's basically impossible, so this creates the infinite number of possibilities that emanate from a single 0 point source. it's actually pretty certain that the universe is fractal manifestation of frequency, so even that point is likely relative to another one, and our own vibrations are even creating alternate universes and super structures of consciousness to this universe, which will then gain consciousness at some point too. it's most certainly fractal.

the important point here is that max undesirable is also max desirable, and your perspective (chosen by you) gives you the choice to perceive and therefore attract both desirable and undesirable based on what portion of the cycle (sine wave) you perceive at.

I can talk endlessly about this if you want more, but for now this is good enough to illustate that the custodians are actually desirable -- if you choose to perceive them that way. crazy talk, I know...

#### the new custodians

custodians serve the purpose of focusing on and trying to eradicate unwanted. for them, it's clear that the most "undesirable" situation for them is for a fully conscious human race they cannot control. therefore, they have to try their hardest to never realise that we do indeed attract a temporal future based on our concept of reality. they know this and are determined to ensure that we continue to believe that they are running the show and have all of us firmly installed into their power structure that they control.

there's no reason to fight them, and I believe tesla realised this. it is my opinion that tesla took over the custodial role. each cataclysm that happens, I believe there is a split that occurs. in simple terms, the attraction power of the different factions become so strong that separated realities must be created.

in the case of tesla, I believe that tesla purposefully left documents behind so that the usa could reverse engineer his world system, control the planet's climate so that they could keep the energy spots controlled (controlling the environmental conditions) and keep the planet from getting too cool.

I believe that tesla gained the capacity to create "golems" -- sentient intelligence that behaves in a conceptual way. this conceptual form of perception is what I call 5d. temporal perception was added and is what I will call 6d. source perception of a heirarchy of beings resonant with a source (like us with earth -> sun -> sirius -> ??? -> galaxy) got moved up to 7d. that form of perception allows one to create any conceptual form as a derivative of self (really anything you can imagine).

I don't have time to explain all the reasons why I think this. questions are encouraged.

anyway, this capacity allowed him to create an army of workers capable of producing his technology and also infiltrate all of the present government positions.

I believe that (the extremely petty) YHVH is also his cration as well. this entity systematically passed through time and performed edits on the timeline, never to inhibit the discovery of technology or ones connection to source (like moses), but to severerly distort the implementation of it.

gods of eden is the story of this -- however, I contend that the majority of that custodial activity was not the gods of eden (the 3rd root race), but the aryans (the 4th root race). consider that the "gods of eden" passed their blood into the fertile crecent / levant region. broadly speaking, this is a clear case of a battle between the aryans and the phonecians/semites.

the manifestation of YHVH and tesla was to fulfill the predicted end of the 3rd root race's hold on humankind. up util the creation/takeover of the YHVH character and turning him into a petty ufo instead of one's connection to source/aten which is what I think moses originally translated it as, gave the semitic custodians much more power, but they were constantly pushed down.

this is an important point to make, because if you fight against something you make it bigger, and it seems this is the objective.

#### why fight against the phonecians (and make them stronger)?

it appears that the whole goal of the aryans, especially after the takeover was to force the rebirth of the phonecians as an socioeconomic superpower and give them ample capability to shoot theirselves in the foot pretty good.

to understand this, imagine from the perspective of tesla. imagine there are japhethites and semites. the hamites are pretty well subdued so they get folded in. all the aryan custodians move down to antartica and are used to do the bidding of YHVH in the temporal adjustments that need to be made to prevent too much enlightenment. remember, if too much enlightenment happens, the two opposite attractions of a future cause a split where some portion still belive that the custodians run the show and the other portion are attracting a future reflective of their concept of reality which is incompatible with the custodians. because the custodians could not continue to survive in that reality, the split must happen to ensure that reality manifested is a reflection of their concept.

the aryan custodians are controlling the world with force and the atlantian custodians are controlling the world socioeconomically. all of the timeline edits done in the past ensure that there are never favourable enough conditions to allow the general population to become enligthened, which is what initiates the split.

the atlantian custodians don't yet know that they need tesla's world system yet. he has it prepared for them, because the inernet will eventually cause communications to rapid enough that they'll lose their ability to limit communications (anyone can talk to anyone on the planet) and they'll also lose their economic control (crypto currency, etc.) too much mental expansion too rapidly when there are so many people on the planet has a cumulative effect.

this happens when people feel better. when people feel better, that means they're moving toward desired. therefore, they need to impose bad-feeling conditions to ensure that no one gets enlightened (where feeling good leads). when too many people get enlightened too quickly, that's when the incompatible realities split occurrs. they don't want that.

more on the consolidation of the custodians later...

#### gray aliens

the gray thing always felt like a hoax to me. when I was younger, I heard that the grays said that humans were inferior to them -- and I only agree when humans are running at low frequency because they're emotionally in a low state (see discussion on effortless power). however, at higher frequencies, I believe humans are the top of the line model in this galaxy.

I belive enki purposefully restricted ou performance at low frequencies, so as long as the slaves are kept at low frequencies, they are inferior to the "gods" which have the tech to induce higher frequencies in the body (pinecone), allowing for levitation of theirselves and large stones. this was a very tricky thing that enki did, because after the last cataclysm, the planet's energies changed and the environment no longer produces these higher frequencies naturally.

this trick was quite the thing because it convinced the custwodians that they want to find ways to induce this higher frequency by finding ways to feel good. in order to retain superiority, they have to find ways to feel good because the planet (or atlantian crystal network -- whatever you wish to believe) no longer provided such a strong baseline anymore.

from a LOA perspective, this means that their desire is now shifted toward wanting to find ways to feel good. most do not want to do this perceptively, and instead continue to rely on conditions/technology for this higher frequency.

there is a second trick that I forsee coming in the future because anyone who's done any amount of drugs or facebook knows that "chasing the dragon" (snakes!) leads to ultimately more and more powerful doses until complete tolerance is developed. they must begin to rely on perception instead of physical conditions to maintain this higher frequency. fortunately tesla's world system allows they the capacity to begin to rely on other people's high frequency perception. the transition from physical conditions to perception I believe will by happening soon.

they will soon find theirselves in a situation where they are completely dependent on other people's high frequency perception to maintain a good enough feeling to remain "superior"...

extremely fortunately, this is also of huge benefit for those which are sensitive emotionally/conceptually/spiritually (effortless power techniques) and are good at transforming perception to see the part of the cycle which is going toward desired (understanding LOA and a desire to feel good).

so it all works out in the end. I predict the custodians in the future will be replaced by more and more petty golems each with a stronger desire to try and keep humans in their worst possible conditions (which will continually improve, dispite their best efforts)

---

from tesla's perspective, he needs to find a way to infiltrate and take over the germans. this I believe was done with golems and automatons. remember, all of these can take on a derivative concept of yourself, and you are anything you can imagine, because 5d characters can take on any form (concept) they perceive theirself to be. 7d allows you to create others of these as an extension of you (eg. you are their "source", which has a source -- just like cells in your body all contain you as their source).

the ability to "externalise the heirarchy" of yourself allows for many different derivitaves of yourself to act in different time and space in resonance to the concept they start at. that concept's source is you, but you too are a composite source. it's like trying to figure out which cells in your body are "you" -- perhaps like how a sound may be perceived to come from many sources or a single one, which too is a composite of sources.

I suspect that tesla rehashed the mars/nibiru story for the grays. likely something like, their species is slowly going extinct and they will exchange human embryos for advanced technology.

it was intended that this tech also get into the hands of the US govt as well, ao they could reverse engineer it.

I believe that the grays shot down in roswell were nothing more than golems flying tesla tech. it also had the added benefit of instilling a lot more fear, allowing for more timeline edits. those edits were actually designed to push them harder to gain more superiority, while at the same time furthering their hidden belief in their inferiority.

#### alien hot-shots

the goal is to arrive to a time like we are in now when they appear to be superior, but deep down they believe they're a buncm of posers. nothing makes one feel more helpess than a belief that there are unknown extraterrestrial forces out there which they can't comprehend or get them to come in and battle them on their turf in the physical.

it's like a huge mind game, to make them feel as out of control as possible while maintaining an image to the other governments (which are also infiltrated) that they remain powerful and in control.

I believe this is the reason why so many "stealth" ufos are flying in broad daylight into positions where they can show their capability and get their picture taken. it's like a guy doing yoga in front of the window, nude.

they're showing off on purpose. in today's society, it's all appearance that sells. I find it strange that nazis, who have based their entire promotional campaign on military displays of raw power and numbers -- to suddenly switch tactics to a hollywood emotional effect.

the best parallel to this is the old german car commercials read you the car's spec sheet (physical). now, no specs are given. instead, appropriate music and a message of what the car is capable of making you feel like is instead displayed (emotional).

this change lends me to believe tesla learned from hollywood (or perhaps vice-versa) and markets his ideas with emotional force, while the WW2 nazis marketed their ideas with physical force.

#### timeline edits

one strange thing to notice is that the ufos never directly engage in hostile activity unless it's what people expect from them. so, small incremental things need to be done to instill fear. a good example of this is the fall of constantanople...

the first emperor to hold constantinople prophesied that constantinople should never be lost, until the moon rose darkened when it was at the full, that is, lacking the half of it

then sure enough when the moon appeared that way, it fell. say there are a bunch of conditions that could allow for easy enlightment for too many people. the city has to fall and those items need to be destroyed by the invaders.

it would by quite an effort to do all of this timeline manipulation by one person because it basically means ensuring that all technology ancient artifacts which make it too easy for one to get enlightened (unless you're custodian approved), need to be confiscated or destroyed.

imagine timelines like a string. the reality you experience now is a reflection of your concept of things. this point is fixed because you cannot delete now. at least one valid path to the present (in your concept of now) has to lead to the present. this is true for everyone.

so, for example, imagine you're looking at the present and notice that there are a bunch of people that are using orgone accumulation chambers to feel good and cure their disease rather than using the power of their mind... well, it's a good thing the inventor believes in the sickness of the human race, so that his fears can be exploited so that he's presented with circumstance wich inclines him to believe that the government wants to put a stop to his machine, and he starts to attract his own imprisonment. for example.

aciennt artifacts are discovered with some truths on them which are successful. so the relevant sections of the ancient artifacts in question need to be damaged, stolen, ship sink, etc.

all of these "unfortunate coincidences" have to be orchestrated through exploitation of people's perception. the brain assumes a lot of things and can come to incorrect conclusions based on your assumptions.

this is a pretty big task, so I could imagine that tesla employed the aryan custodians to do most of this work. as they died off, they were replaced by golems capable of automating the process.

it's unknown how many edits were done, but I imagine it was a lot. I also imagine that the majority of it was automated through power structures. you only need to transmit the concept I just explained to the guy in charge of the team to do this. if they flub the timeline, no worries just go back and to it again without disaster.

it's pretty easy to see if it's working because the future point will have the desired effect removed or not. if not, just adjust the past point again. I believe the future point is sometime in the next 20 years, and the fulcrum was a bunch of points during and after WW2.

rinse and repeat. pretty easy to automate.

#### crop circles

because all trajectories through time are the result of people's concept of reality which tune to the destination point -- small "inconsequential" anomalies like crop circles can provide a gentle modification of the trajectory.

like tesla's earthquake machine, these tiny influences add up. from our perspective we don't know how much these crop circles were tracked and studied, and how much the abstract shapes had a slight (inconsequential really) effect on the consciousness of those studying them.

#### skinwalker ranch

this appears to be a location on the planet which allows for much faster frequencies. you'll notice that under these sorts of circumstances, imaginary concepts can appear (and even interact) with people. I believe that environmental energies were higher in past times and that's what made these "demons" and gnomes, fey, etc. so easy to interact with.

I'll call this the "astral" realm and is a high frequency field which allows etheric (conceptual) objects to appear in space. if you have access to DMT and I have also experienced it on ketamine as well -- mushrooms work really well (for best results smoke some mdma to keep a good vibe under high doses). conjure a feeling of some thing -- like imagine that there are these gnomes -- I call them "reality technicians" that are really precise but humorous guys that can show you a moving abstract image ("I see what you mean" you'll say) and you'll fully grasp the concept they want to show you as a response.

you may not see them in 3d space at first, but feel their presence until you know they're there. feel what it would be like to talk to a knowledgeable gnome (the less you try to imagine him and instead feel him, the better)

the reality technicians are the skinwalker in different form. they can only appear in a form resonant with your consciousness. if I went there, I would enjoy a nice moment with the reality technicians perceiving these sorts of ideas (cause I think about these subjects a lot) manifesting in 3d space. I don't think it would be a mobius strip. I'm interested in asymmetrical forms like the chestahedron or the decatria.

these zones amplify your imagination by getting your brain to produce more DMT till the emotions you feel appear in 3d space. there's a black mirror episode called playtest which is this effect. notice the mushroom theme. I don't know how to explain it better, but it's the manifestation of emotions in 3d space.

---

my intuition tells me that the skinwalker may also be a golem and is designed to produce fear in visitors. seeing as all conditions which produce this effect have been neutralised or made illegal, it's likely this is just another instance of custodians keeping us away from relying on conditions rather than perception.

#### final thoughts

I believe that on a bigger picture, there are quite a few people that want to become masters of perception, capable of transforming any bad-feeling into a good one by figuring out a new way to perceive the same concept from another angle which reveals desirable motion. so, this situation is attracted and quite desirable.

I believe everyone wants to perceive, feel, and manifest whatever they desire. 

however, there are those that also wish to continue to rely on conditions because they still do not think they know what they want. they believe this because they're gaining a tolerance to the conditions that make them feel good. they still haven't come to the realisation that they're not looking for a thing to produce a feeling, but a form of perception to produce that feeling.

the next stage is to realise that only perception can produce the feeling they want. the custodians will soon have to figure out how to exploit us for that, which from the perspective of someone capable of transforming feeling with perception is basically free energy.

personally, for me this is highly desirable. the more they need me to feel good, the more energetic I am and the better I can feel myself. I don't need them to change.

it's funny how this is the typical stereotype hatred many men have with women because they think they hate that about them. that is a missconception, because you can usually only recognise things you desire for yourself in others.

the other typical stereotype is that people (usually women) with the idea that others need them to feel good, also have the idea that because they depend on them, they don't want them to change.

the third typical stereotype which is the correlary to this is the one that says, "I need you to be different so I can feel good". many family and social difficulties are built on that foundation.

---

I'm done.

ok, so you don't know how much I've enjoyed these ufo presentations; especially the last one! the concise way you have grouped such a vast number of disparate topics into easily digested segments really exploded my brain with so many thoughts.

these thoughts are in raw form and are presented as-is. this is 100% speculation, so please don't take the narrative too seriously. it just serves as a very unique explanation to get some principals of perception to come through. though I wrote it sounding pretty certain of myself, I give the narrative a max 70% certainty. hopefully the narrative was exciting enough to make the principals sound more engaging (I'm learning the emotional marketing too myself)

warm regards,
kenny

### 2021-09-10 17:24 - I think I figured out the 2038 thing

I believe it's the maximum inflection point that can happen before it's past the point of no return for the split.

so, it basically means that up until then the mars thing can happen. I don't know for sure, but I would guess that there is a way to relieve the pressure.

there's not a whole lot of risk to doing the galaxy thing.. after a while, I'm sure people will get bored of it and want to do something harder. we can then go back and sabotage this timeline and pass through the cataclysm.

the realisation seemed more real than these words. I wanted to writ it though.

### 2021-09-11 04:47 - I don't know what to do

I was just watching stars and with my left eye, I got to the state where my whole body goes into this weird paralysis and tingling as it feels like my vision is expanding. it feels like I would normally gain a new perspective there -- like, get connected. I'm not totally sure though and I don't want to force it.

I laid there and looked at the star with both eyes and noticed that it was back to how it used to be where my eyes would look forward parallel, not toward a point. I stopped looking with both eyes because this stopped working and they would cross instead. I believe this is because I see the image of my left eye in the right eye.

the other possibility is that my brain has gotten used to the reversed eyes setup (both eyes are looking wide to look at a point) and it straitens them instead by looking in but by looking outward... hard to explain the sensation.

---

anyway, the reason why I don't know what I want to do is because I don't want to try and force it. I know that whenever I artificially push my body toward a goal, it works out fine because it's like practise -- however, if I accomplish something with artificial conditions, then I don't like it.

man, it's hard to explain that too...

anyway, the difficulty arises for me because I have this feeling like they want to try and get me with the girls again. I really want to be connected. I also really want to have some time to figure out how to conjure other things with my mind so that there can be other versions of me too.

I think this is kinda important because I don't want to be responsible for how others feel. it's OK if copies of me are responsible for others' satisfaction, but I don't personally want to be obligated to perform.

this is mainly the reason why I stayed out of the public. I like being there and having fun sometimes, but when people feel I need to be some way or do some thing so that I can be a part of the celebration... it's weird.

the opposite side of this is that there is one me (right now) and there are lots of girls. it's just not possible (and neither do I want to try) to satisfy all of their requests. again, this is a job for the clones.

you know, often times I don't need to be a part of the main manifestation. it's like in tuenti -- I really did not mind that there were so many people partying around me. I didn't feel I needed to have a relationship.

it's really hard to describe this in words. it feels like there is an idea that I need to be compensated for my efforts or something. almost universally, it feels like that should be some form of affection.

to me affection doesn't feel needed. I really like me. I don't need someone else to like me so that I can like me, too.

as an analogy, there are various things that people do to feel good, and some of them even feel essential to a lot of people, but I don't need those things to feel good... ok, new angle.

imagine there is a film or something that everone is telling me that I have to go and see. I don't really care if I see the film or not. it's not going to make me feel better than I already can feel, so it feels very low priority. let's say that I'm also not allowed into the theatre or I don't have money to go either. that part doesn't matter to me because it's not even a high priority to me. they feel I *need* to see the film, so somone brings me a hdcam version of the film (low quality version) and suggests that I watch that.

why do I want to watch a low quality version of the film now? why not just wait until it comes out on DVD? in the same respect, I don't want to try and force getting connected just for some affection. I already like me and I'm expanding at a rapid rate. if anything, it could be seen maybe as a reward or something, but then obviously why would I reward myself with a hdcam version of the film when it's not what I'm looking for?

it seems plainly obvious to me that I want to wait until I'm connected. it doesn't offer mental expansion, and that's what I want. I don't want to force mental expansion either. that's not effortless. I want to keep expanding and not have this hindering it.

this is about where I was at in (the beginning part of) tuenti with all of the discos and stuff. there were all these dudes super worried about trying to hook up with girls in the disco. I didn't find that to be a priority. they're not expanding my consciousness. I come away from those events feeling like I lost perception, not gained.

it's true though ended up later a hypocrite, spending most of my time drinking and not really expanding mentally very much. this, I believe is because I fought against the efforts of people trying to put me in their drinking, girls, and party lifestyle. I became the thing I fought against. I turned into an idle drunk fighting the world's injustices.

so, I mean I'm not really about that. I like continuing to expand mentally, yet I don't want to force it, because that means fighting it (effort). I want to continue on my gradual discovery and practise of percieving things the way I want to.

there is a definite sense that the effort to get me to watch the hdcam film is because it will distract me for some time away from my mental expansion. that certainly is true, but it's just not that relevant to me. I don't need others' affection to be able to like me or find me acceptable. I don't need validation from them and I definitely don't need to be compensated or rewarded for anything.

all of these are side-issues in my opinion. I'm just going to keep going steady. we'll get there eventually. there's no need to rush anything at all.

nice, problem soleved :)

### 2021-09-11 13:17 - solar perception, compensation, and magic wands

three concepts: they appear separated, but they are connected. I'll return to them more in the future too cause I think it's an important one.

---

I kept getting a few reactions to the concept I presented in my letter to marty. I talked about three concepts of where the more the custodians depend on me (or tesla) to feel good, the better we can feel because we're capable of transforming bad-feeling energy into something that feels good using perception (a feeling of going toward or away something desirable).

however, I said it (purposefully) in a way that was very similar to the stereotypical perception that society has of women. the thing is, the sun has the same perception about us. there are some differences in some of the surrounding concepts, but essentially I'm point out that solar perception is stigmatised in this society and I believe understanding that perception was a huge breakthrough in realising that you cannot fight aganst unwanted. instead shift perception so that the undesirable is perceived as moving (eventually) toward something more desired.

---

I also had some reactions to the idea of compensation in last night's entry. I used to think that girls consciously offered sex as a compensation for behaviour that they liked. that is, afterall the way it's presented in the movies. if you do what she wants, sex; if not, you're sleeping on the sofa.

I determined that was not the case, because if that were true then that means that girls all over the world are consciously compensating douchebags for their behaviour. I determined that was likely not the case, and that instead a more simple answer is that they're just choosing the option that feels the best and often times the douchebags often have more money or material posessions, so they're perceived to be more capable of providing a more luxurious experience. that's it.

so, none of this is a case of compensation. that's an illusion presented by hollywood, yet doesn't have any basis in reality. I have seen many men perform above and beyond what is expected if them and the girl still appears to reward some other douchebag instead. the more simple answer is that the first guy isn't exciting enough or doesn't make her feel good enough so she looks elsewhere.

this creates a huge tangled mess though because often then the guy thinks he needs to spice things up or do something exceptional for her. this too is a flawed conclusion because the way she feels isn't his responsibility.

the road of compensation is dangerous road to go down, almost always ending in making the other person responsible for how I feel.

---

I woke up this morning to a flurry of dream putting me into situations where I was being isolated into places with girls and other strange things. I even remember something about making out with jessica, too.

I woke up terribly uneasy about the situation because it felt like I was getting put into inevitazble situations. I had to make a decision between making a fail to girls again or doing something that doesn't at all feel effortless, but actually quite stressful.

I remembered the first concept there and decided to take a non-fighting approach to it. I determined that I would just go and then figure out how to let my creation happen anyway. afterall, the more people that depend on me to feel good, the more energy it summons throgh me. from that perspective, I *want* people to depend to feel good.

so I decided to not fight it, and just go with it. the feeling shifted from the groin area up to my heart again. that's good, so I know I'm on the right track. I then remembered the conversation I had with jaron about jerrica and the magic wand. I wanted to ask her if she had a magic wand, would she at least make replica magic wands for her friends?

the picture that came into my mind was the idea that even if I couldn't gain the power to create whatever I felt like (magic wand), then I could imagine that the girls could, and they could make all of the magic wands they wanted and give them to anyone they wanted to give them to.

I was reminded of tuenti when I was considering the success of "invite only" vs open to the public. facebook opened up to the public and that (IMO) had negative results to the quality of the page. it left a huge market opening for exclusive social networks, which IMO still has not been filled.

shifting this to a way where the girls invite their friends to join in by replicating the magic wand for them is a great implementation of the "invite only" way of doing things. I kinda approve. feels OK to me so far.

there were the obvious reactions to this, too. someone is pretty convinced that this will create a sort of female deminated society. there are a lot of other feelings mixed in there. it may be his worst fear. lol...

### 2021-09-12 2:15 - who I really am (???)

I was outside staring at jupiter taking a break from the latest ufos part 6b (or whatever) and I notice that there are a lot of similarities to a lot of these people he's identifying, to me. I did notice this is the case, but I don't find it to be a problem because it's all a tuning thing. in my next response I will be talking a lot about "conceptual programs" so some of what I say here may not be clear there. I'm just going to assume you know what I'm talking about... anyway, I was having a bit of a monologue and decided to just write this instead.

context: from as long as I can remember, I've had this belief that it's impossible to die. I don't remember being scared of death either. it's a very conflicting set of beliefs because if I'm put in a situation that's a failure, I don't mind dying. I don't find it a problem at all. however, in the case of suicide, I don't know how to do it. I have this fear that no matter my attenmpts to commit suicide, I would continue to live, but with the pain of whatever it was. like, if I ingested a lethal dose of something, I would have to suffer hours of pain while my system removes it. or, if I tried to jump off of a bridge, I would bounce off the ground or something with all my bones broken. in the case of a gun at point blank, I figured I would never get there or if I did, then something would happen or I would accept dying. death, in my mind wan't going to be an accident. I had to allow it to happen, and I can't force it.

I've always had this idea that if I did die, then I could just travel around the planet and find another suitable body to jump into and take over. kinda borg-like or parasitic, I guess. so even if I *did* die, then it's not like it's that big of a problem.

so, because of this, I resonated strongly with a book called "project superman". in the book, the US govt is testing the limits of this guy andy pero. no matter what they do, he finds a way to recover back to his concept of himself. I always found the story interesting because he never used his powers to improve his body -- just to heal it back to the age, shape, and attributes he perceives it to have.

disclaimer: this is 100% fiction. I'm playing around with ideas here.

---

all of us are conceptual programs we're all eternal. however, I think I'm one that figured out how to find my connection pretty easily. let's just assume my personality is similar to the one I presently have. I'm constantly optimising so much that certainly I got really good at it.

so at some point in the distant past, I got connected and figured out that I am a conceptual program that can take on physical form. I do this enough times to find out I can incarnate into the physical at will. each time, I find my way back to non-physical with relative ease. in fact, I'm so good at optimising my conceptual program, I have to keep putting myself into more and more difficult situations. each time however, I get better and better at it. if it's too hard, I just die and try again. however, if I don't choose to die, then I always find my way.

obviously I want to make more difficulty for myself, so I invent conceptual programs for people interacting with me -- like, they're presented with concepts of doubt or distrust when interacting with me. this works at first, but eventually people start to believe me even when presented with doubt and unbelief. same for trust. dispite my best efforts, each iteration, my charisma continues to grow.

this isn't hard enough. I need foes that physically are stronger and more powerful than me, and I need to find ways to defeat them too. I invent worlds where they have tremendous strength, flight and other supernatural capabilites. nothing can keep me down.

I then decide to try pitting me against copies of myself -- and even still. I defeat myself. I discover that this creates a split. we both win in our own timelines.

now, I get the most brilliant idea of them all. I create a bunch of bad-guys which are just modified versions of myself, which have the ability to create unlimited other living entities at will.

the plan is to incarnate into the world, and then give them unlimited resources to try and keep me trapped in the world. they need to have a bunch of secrets that they need to keep hidden -- or maybe I'm very destructive to them -- some incentive to ensure that they must continually keep me incarnated in a physical body, unable to access the astral realm.

I'm trapped in a world they have full control over. the most difficult challenge yet :)

---

as I'm writing this, I'm realising to myself that all the difficulty leading up to now may have been the setup required to get this most elaborate trap going. problem is, if this isn't fiction, then I just spoiled the trap because now "they" know that I created the trap for myself. that means, it's required to gvo back and sabotage this timeline and prevent myself from getting connected and also writing this.

### 2021-09-13 00:59 - creative energy and the custodial formula

so, it seems that it was intended that I fight against the efforts of those dreams. I decided that I didn't want to fight their efforts to try and stick me with the girls.

sure, there were some slight downers to the setup -- like I really want to get connected, but then again maybe that isn't exactly what I want.

if I get connected, then I'll figure out how to create replicas of myself, but that's kinda like open registration. anyone who wants it can get it. obviously, I would want to try and make an interface for people to create what they want easily. I don't want to have to micromanage it. that seems like a lot of effort to me.

therefore, the obvious solution now for me is to find a way to make sure that the girls I'm with have the capacity to make these replicas instead. then, the problem is solved and I don't have to do any micromanagement. they can create these guys for their friends.

sure, it creates a bit of an "exclusive" or "elite" sort of setup where some have the thing and some do not. however, I think that's preferrable because it keeps the desire and the quality high. you have to ask someone you know that has one for a replica -- you can't just get it at will.

the reaction was that someone must know how effective an invite-only network is (probably this was the growth strategy nosebook took). so, someone thinks it'll work.

the next reaction that I got was that they would just do that without me. I don't really care. it's not my job to tell people what they can and cannot do. it's only my desire to try and give as many people as I can the possibility to create their own golems. no big deal.

this next part is really foggy because I wasn't conscious for most of it. there was then a sense that something was going to be making that not possible. I don't know the picture or the thing that was put there to give that impression, but it's obviously an illusion.

you see the custodial formula is to use implication to make an illusion that something is one way, and so then people will make an action based on what they do or do not want. this is basic sales and marketing. the suggestions that they give to imply that a product will do such a thing are just that: implications.

once you then believe in the implications, they can drive action to get you to buy the product or use you to further their goals in some way. this is nearly every aspect of society at this point. probably the easiest to see would be the amun priesthood in egypt. they create so much imagery in people's imagination about what happens when you die, that the implication is that you need some thing that they are selling to get into the beneficial afterlife. or, maybe you want love. they create so many illusions that you are not capaable of attracting it on your own, that you have to purchase some gimmick and say a spell to get you the love interest you desire.

what I'm saying is, this formula is ancient and pretty well optimised. so let's go over some of it.

---

from my perspective, if I somehow have attracted a situation that I don't believe I can get out of, then I have to just accept it. (I am where I am, and that has to be OK, because that's where I am)

because it's all attraction, then before it manifests, I can always adjust my trajectory to avoid it. however, if I feel I cannot back out of it and it has not yet manifested, then the situation is an illusion. I am beliving an implication.

what I just learned is that the implication isn't alwas the direct one, but the desired output. they believed I would fight it, but I didn't. so I'm learning that the non-fighting approah is always a good way to go. I don't think that fighting ever yields good results.

so, it's weird because from my perspective, I want to keep going for as long as I can go, knowing that I'll eventually get connected. the major take-away for me here is to not try and make it possible for anyone to get anything that they want. instead, I want to do it invite-only and exclusive.

I know that sounds weird, but for a person like me who is so open and free with my ideas, the idea of exclusivity is not the first thing that comes to mind. I usually have a low opinion of exclusive stuff because I dislike the idea that I have to perform to their expectations in exchange for an invite.

I usually don't value anything anyone has high enough to do that. I'd prefer to figure it out or pay for it myself than to try and perform for someone. obviously, that's not how the world works though, so I can't really go against the flow.

the other way to do it is to have a force which is opposing people joining it, and so therefore create value that way. like, if nosebook were to try and prevent people from getting the capacity to create their own golems, then it would be a sort of discovery of how to figure out how to do that.

---

for me, it doesn't really matter. I know from my perspective I just need to keep going for as long as I can go without any manifestations. if I find myself in a situation that I don't feel I can get out of and a manifestation happens.

so like my goal is to not try and push through to getting connected as fast as possible. I believe I have until 2038 before it's too late, so like plenty of time... enough about that.

---

people may wonder why I'm so head-strong on trying to go without a manifestation, and why that makes me so attractive. I claim it's creative energy, which I think is the driver behind invention. terence calls it novelty. you want the thing that is novel -- not the thing that everyone else has. this drive to obtain the thing that no one else has what drives innovation. literally. I also claim this to be a very feminine force. it's funny that we commonly associate this with the stereotypical person that always wants what they can't have. this is the inventive nature.

we all have a little bit of this in us. I absolutely want what I can't have, too. however, I don't believe it's another person's responsibility to give it to me. I want to get it for myself. if it's not yet discovered, then I feel I must find a way to it.

it's funny how the topics here are connected. this is the sense that I want people around me to have. so, now I'm actually beginning to turn away from the idea of invite-only again, and this time I want the network that I create to be illegal and prohibited. something that is so profane, that no mainstream people will want to join it. it'll be reserved for the innovators.

I really don't mind that there's an invite-only network out there. I have to figure out now the structure of it's appearance. how do I make something that is so terrible that nosebook and most people will think is so evil/terrible that people should be prevented from joining it.

we need to build a whole bunch of false implications around it. like, you're a follower of satan or something. maybe make it's motto "do what thou wilt" and stuff like that. the implication is that it's something evil and awful.

obviously, I want nothing to do with all of that bogus satanist crap. all of that nonsense is an old paradigm designed to create a false negative appearance. in reality, it's going to be all about LOA and how you are an infinite, eternal, wonderful being..

lol.. gonna have to think this over. the image of people joining a satanic cult designed to equip a person to "do what thou wilt" is an interesting idea..

---

perhaps I'll call it, the anti-innovators guild or something like that. our quest will be to come up with novel solutions to erradicate innovation.

needs more thought...

### 2021-09-13 03:17 - pueblo superstars

I realised that the organisation needs to be desirable for most people, but definitely not to a specific group (nosebook). I also don't really like that dark stuff, anyway so it's not a good fit for me. the idea was that would be the outer image, but the reality is it would be more about fun, feeling good, and not needing any conditions to accomplish that. because the image is so much more different than the reality of it, I'm getting back into secret stuff and exclusive, because you need to know the people who know the truth to get the proper image.

instead, what I'm looking for is something that is highly addictive, easy to get and has viral properties in the sense that it spreads fast and could be perceived as a threat to others.

going back to the part about wanting nosebook to fight against it and try to prevent its spread, I was reminded of that one reaction where I said that I *want* others to depend on me to feel good.

the reaction that I got to that was that idea is highly detestible -- something they don't want more people thinking.

I also had a similar feeling of detestment to the "want what's not easy to get" (want what you can't have). I have also noticed similar feelings to the girl with insatiable desire and "never satisfied".

these are all things that I suppose I originally tried to fight against in myself. eventually, I had to give in and recognise that these are parts of my personality. however, as I've gained more perspective, I notice that from a solar perspective, these viewpoints are valid. as a human, one could argue that they are not.

I suppose there are a number of other ideas out there that fall into the solar perception which is detestable for a person to have. that may be the way to go.

---

the other thing that I was thinking of is the idea of planets and their role. so, imagine for a moment just the case of replicas and girls, where a replica is a planet and the girl is a sun. there could be other males, but that's not what I'm trying to show here.

when a girl figures out how to produce repicas (planets), she can produce them for herself or for other stars. each girl will figure out different models that she finds more desirable and pass them out to her friends to try out. the most desirable models will be the successful ones and they'll get the most utilisation.

you could imagine a lot of innovation that happens there. other men may perceive this as a threat. that could be a pretty good reason for some of them to feel competition/jealousy over who has the most desirable/effective men.

nice. I kinda like it... max disaster :)

### 2021-09-13 03:49 - physical vs conceptual reality

one of the things russ noticed in one of the snake-bros episodes was that the custodians constantly use war to get people away from the spiritual stuff by focusing them into the material details. the idea is that it forces people to focus on the physical implementation of an idea rather than its conceptual implementation.

this is almost always not the case for me though. every time that I try to do anything physical or material related, they're in the business of preventing me from doing it. like, if I try to code, they're constantly trying to figure out how to get me to stop. they don't want me to interact with people physically. they don't want me to have sex, etc.

---

I don't really know what is up here. after those dreams about being put into situations with girls where I felt like I couldn't leave them and make them the fail, I was terribly distraught because I didn't want to make more fails, but I also want to continue on with mental/conceptual expansion for as long as possible and don't want to have to be physically focused.

if I could move my body with ease and agility, then being physically focused would be not that bad, but in my present state, I'd rather remain conceptually focused. I understand so many things now, it really feels like I can figure any concept I want to figure out. I just desire and the answer comes to me.

because I have such a huge amount of questions and there is such a relatively small time between question and answer now, I'd like to continue to expand my mind and pass as much of that information on as I can. each time I do this, I get more. the physical aspect to me is completely inconsequential.

---

I'm trying to figure out how to quantify what it is about this time of mental expansion that I like so much and it's difficult to quantify.

perhaps I'll say it like this: everything is feeling easier and easier all the time. it's the feeling of "effortless power" that I'm enjoying so much. sure, I don't have any manifestation that I can show off for this yet, but it's sort of like training or a dojo in the sense that you can expend so much effort becoming the strongest, fastest, and most agile, but I'm feeling that way mentally.

some people do a lot of exercises to feel agile or strong, but I what I aim to show is that I can feel agile or strong and it was as if I had done the exercises.

I don't want to imply that physical is not necessary. the physical implementation is still necessary. it's something more like becoming my own golem.

### 2021-09-14 20:08 - not until the separation

I've been thinking about this a lot and I want to wait until after the separation until I have any interaction. the reason for this is I simply want to be feeling stable in my capacities and stuff before I do.

lately, I noticed that as I was getting close to the enlightenment experience when watching stars that I would start to feel really uneasy. that uneasy feeling is not likely my own -- prolly mr. motor or something... however, in any case, if I'm feeling it, that means I'm still resonant with it. right before I get there, I stop and go do something else for a bit.

this technique feels good to me and I like it because I'm practising so that it's natural for me to be in that state of mind. I don't want to be bouncing in and out of alignment depending on whatever conditions are around. I like the practise and have no intention to rush things.

the other thing about this technique is that it reminds me a bit of mantak chia talks about with the cosmic orgasm. each time, the goal is to get close but not go too far, each time building up energy further. then, finally when it can't be held anymore the orgasm experience is one of gaining consmic consciousness. it effect wasn't my intention because orgasm doesn't really take any skill or technique -- but, watching stars does. it's more a practised frame of mind and a confidence that is a normal thing to do. I liken it to riding a bike, walking, or driving a car.

I want this state of mind to feel natural for me. I really am not in any rush at all to get there.

---

I want to be able to say the same for girls too. I still do not at all feel comfortable with it. it feels too much of a big step and it feels very unnatural still. what I mean is, when I feel comfortable with it, then I'll go for it.

what that means for me is, I want to find my connection and get used to that first. my first goal is to figure out how to make replicas of myself and let the girls play with them for a while. meanwhile this is happening, I want to work on an idea that I haven't talked about much but it's basically another network, but it's powered by the sun.

nosebook operates in the physical world. it transmits a signal into your physical body which then produces an image in your imagination. my system will be the exact opposite. everyone will automatically have one tuned to them. you will feel certain concepts to interact with this network (instead of thinking -- you feel), and then these feelings get transformed and amplifed in a conceptual program which then causes you to feel a way in response, when then that feeling will produce an image in the imagination or a feeling in the body.

it's a conceptual network rather than a physical one. it will naturally create spaces for people of like mind to interact. so, like you don't need to go out and try and find these people in real life -- but instead can interact with them in these spaces.

there are other ideas I have as well, but that's the easiest one to describe.

what this allows me to do is to gain confidence in my capacity to feel the way I want to feel, and I don't have to worry about all of the other stuff.

---

this is really far-out, but I was even thinking of making a whole plot-twist here. I have been talking about how I don't want to be physically focused and want to remain conceptually focused. so, imagine that I enjoy the feeling that all of the different replicas of me feel like and the enjoyment of perceiving all of this from an emotional/conceptual perspective that I make my transition into this conceptual network.

essentially, I am the network. I keep it running and ensure that everything is continually expanding and new things are constantly being felt. I'll have an unlimited supply of physical beings that I can supply the physical realm with. as fast as people can feel the new being it can be created. in fact, that I know of, *any* physical thing can be conjured at will with this sort of setup. all those participating in my network will be able to create anything they feel into reality.

it's kind of an interesting concept. it's so far out, I don't really know where to begin thinking about it, but the cool thing is I don't need to worry about it now. first, make my conceptual network, then I can figure that part out.

---

anyone can do or have anything they feel they can do or have. however, for me, the most interesting part about this is not this physical manifestation. I like the idea of being whatever I want to be.

this is only the beginning.

### 2021-09-15 01:31 - a bit more on the conceptual network

I wasn't trying to imply that I'm planning on making my transition into the conceptual network -- only that the thought was quite invigorating to think about.

the third panel in my mdma vision cards has my saying to a crowd of people, "this is a machine capable of desire" -- because I have wanted to, for a long time, to be able to create autonomous machines capable of desire. I even thought about it a bunch last night -- where you progam a small machine with a manifestation frequency (like dimensions in time or space) and the machine has to figure out how to get there...

I've also wanted to, myself, merge with the machines. the thought of having a form of perception that operates in the MHz or GHz ranges sounds incredible to me. I often thought of this as some sort of device that could condense or simplify the information around me so that I didn't get so much information overload and could reduce or enhance perception on certain things that interested me.

point is, I've given this a lot of thought -- however as I've goten better at this, I realised that 90% of the stuff I wanted this improved perception for can be accomplished in the conceptual world much easier, and it's also far more ergonomic, too.

---

so, the idea of essentially merging with the conceptual worl is enticing to me. I would become a living network that kind of holds the physical layer together. a sort of like secondary source. obviously I can't replace LOA, but there are a lot of different things that can be done...

first, let's just look at normal operation of manifestation of things in the physical world. you feel a thing and the system picks it up, transforms it and then sends it back to you. this all happens instantaneously -- just like LOA -- so no delay on anything. any transformation can be programmed. as in example, you could program it to send you back a feeling of calm when you feel anger -- or maybe like a slight vibration in your muscles -- whatever, really.

when it comes to privacy, it's as private as it can possibly be. only you are you, so only you can access it. you can do pretty much whatever you want with it too. if you want to manifest a hot babe every time you feel horny or lonely, you could do that too. really all things are possible.

I imagine that most people will choose to manifest replicas of theirselves, or specific golems designed to perform certain tasks.

---

obviously not everything will be possible at first, because many things will still need to be discovered and identified. it also is subject to the rules of LOA too, so the vibrations you're trying to inflict on others will also manifest for you. so, like imagine for a moment that you try to destroy something someone else has created... it's not really destroyed, and you're also manifesting for yourself a reality that feels that way too.

imagine then that you want to program a transformation to that destruction. you still need to perform the destruction and also the transformed result to make the transformation, so it wouldn't really be a surprise for them.

let's say someone plays a practical joke and makes a transformation that every time they laugh, you pop a boner... well, you could just transform that transformation too into something else -- like maybe giving them a boner back.

all things can be transformed. also death soon becomes impossible. if you "die" you can just realise yourself again in any body that you desire. you don't even need to die to realise yourself in any body that you want. you are not the physical body. you can have as many bodies as you want and do as many things as you want to do at a time.

---

so, you say, then what's the point if there aren't any stakes. ah, good observation. you would create worlds where there is the illusion of permanence and death and then incarnate into them to have that experience.

I imagine that most of people's time will be spent creating games and worlds where you can win/lose the game. or, they would be interested in making meme realities, jokes and other out of place things which are surprising but not likely that useful.

since I run the network, I would be the custodian... welcome to hell :)

---

the reactions to this are funny. I wonder which is worse -- the mars idea or this one... lol


### 2021-09-15 13:00 - concept vs meaning

I woke up this afternoon to an explosion sound in my head. in the dream, I was pointing out how hollywood takes certain symbols (physical details, actions, etc) and puts them into a sequence, to condition you to belive that whenever you see one symbol, followed by another symbol, then a thing will happen.

this technique has been used for a long time to teach kids what to expect in certain situations -- like what to expect from strangers in tme forest in little red ridinghood. this technique is the foundation upon which all prophecy is built and hollywood employs it everywhere.

it's designed to program your mind to perceive similar symbols in your own life and then come to expect the result that happens in the film.

because most of our lives we learn by watching, many people (including those that make these films) believe these implications are the way that reality works. in fact, a lot of them are reportraying past events from an implication standpoint -- like maybe a past relationship or whatever -- so, people watching begin to expect the same sort of behaviour out of their mate, if they notice similar "signs" of that behaviour.

---

this is what I call the 3-7 form of perception. you pay attention to physical details (7), and then come to conclusions of what will happen based on the percceived logic or implications of those details (3).

aftter raquel, I was caught up in this very badly. like, very very badly. I saw a bunch of things happening (actions) and physical hechos that I then made implications about what was happening. I was totally driving myself so crazy with it that I attracted a very life-changing event -- vallecas.

prior to that I got my first glimpse of abraham and they said that all manifestations that are happening can be traced back to the way I feel. I started to remake a lot of the prior associations I had, and instead of looking at physical details, actions and hechos (things that happened), I looked at how I felt. I started to see pretty quickly that every one of those details were a reflection of the way *I* felt.

I started to value how I felt more and more, so I started to feel better the best way I knew how which was drugs, alcohol, and programming. unfortunately, I still had a lot of those implications hanging around still and I found myself in vallecas...

a number of times I recovered from these bad feelings and could find ways to feel better, but I would then find myself in another situation which would reveal false implications.

for example, when I went to valverde I noticed that people were looking through my eyes, and I started to realise that my eyes are being manipulated. every time that I would go from 3d to 4d, it would go away; the spot in my eye would move around; my vision would get better, then worse when I slept. obviously someone was preventing me from getting to the state I wanted to be at (4d).

the implication was that I was no longer in control over my physical reality. someone could put sounds anywhere, shock my body when I saw any images in my eyes, or whatever to ensure that I couldn't get the manifestation that I wanted (to see creations in my eyes and build incredible things like tesla in my imagination).

because it appeared like they had my physical reality subdued, then the implication was that I would never be able to get what I wanted. it also implied that I had to *fight* the oppressor (just like in the movies) and the righttous man hero would emerge victorious.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRL3wx-ZKsg)

obviously this is totally not the way to go about it. the idea of fighting it only made it worse, and I eventually felt my power slipping away so far that I was entering into a state of depression.

after a complete disablement of my left-side, I found myself back here in the USA. this time, because I felt powerless to get what I wanted, I had severe depression because the implication is that I would never be able get what I wanted. they were using my own capabilities against me. thankfully abraham insisted on reminding me that "it's all attraction" -- and admittedly, I knew they were right, but it was annoying to be wrong about my rightous quest to get the capacity that I had discovered.

I figured out how to watch stars and improve my frequency, so I should be able to use the thing I discovered... right?

---

I've come a long way since then and now those ideas seem very outdated. it doesn't matter what they're doing, and in fact, those things aren't what I really want, anyway. I don't really care about that stuff. nowadays, I have figured out the power of being able to feel any way that I want. that's a lot better than some stupid capability of seeing images or whatever. I'm learning that the concept that one has *is* their reality.

the common way to produce this concept is through pattern recognition and the implication of the next expected result in the pattern is what will manifest.

these concepts either feel good or they don't feel good. if they feel good, they are in alignment with the way you want to feel.

---

I suppose I still have quite a few implications still floating around in a lot of places. I know they're just concepts though.

I'll return to this. I want to think more on it.

---

there is an idea that I have which all paths, lead to the future you. with some taking longer than others (imagine lighnighmg going between two points. it never goes in a straight line). the only thing that prevents you from reaching the destination is an inability to maintain alignment with it -- like say maybe it's transforming too fast or something.

however, all paths do lead to the same location -- just some appear to take more time because they traverse a longer distance.

so really, it's much more about my ability to tune rather than the path to get there. obviously some paths are more desirable than others, but again that has to do with my tuning, and not the environment or the conditions.

still needs more thought...

ok, so there's a difference between feeling physically good (pleasure) and feeling emotionally good (joy or happiness). I probably have a lot of implications still that degrade the feeling of physical manifestations.

I have a lot of people around me still that believe all sorts of things about relationships and when they see certain key things, they freak out. a good example of this was the idea of "wanting what you don't have" or "wanting people to depend on you to feel good". these have huge implications in a lot of people's minds that don't have the same implications in mine.

more thought is definitely needed :)

### 2021-09-15 16:44 - magnetic field of earth

the reason why the magnetic field of earth interests me is because I think the rotation of the earth is directly correlated.

the part about the two satellites being pointed just off of the east coast and the other being pointed just off of the west coast is that the shapes of those curves show that a stronger megnetic field is induced on earth when the sun is straight overhead (perpendicular). that means that as the earth rotates, the sun generates a magnetic field on the surface of the earth which then, if we imagine the core of the earth to be a dynamo, the higher magnetic field will pull the rotor toward it. something similar to this must be how the earth rotates.

therefore, I will consider the crust of the earth to have a rotating magnetic gradient around a rotor (prolly a rocky core of silicates) and this operates like an AC motor.

if I plug a motor into 60Hz electricity, it will rotate 60 times a second (3600rpm). this means that the rotation of the earth roughly matches the frequency. this will yield a roughly constant rotation speed, with the earth rotating as fast as the gradient moves around. everything should be constant -- neither slowing down or speeding up.

however, we know that the earth's rotation was slowing down until 2020 when it started to speed up slightly. I think this has something to do with the magnetic field strength. I wanted to know if the field strength is weakening or not because if my theory is correct, it should be increasing in strength and that's why rotation rate is speeding up.

---

to demonstrate this theory, imagine a standard 60 Hz motor plugged into the wall. run it at 120V and it goes fine. now, lower the voltage gradually and notice that the motor is having trouble to turn as fast because the field isn't strong enough to pull the rotor fast enough.

if we change the setup to one where there is a setup similar to the one where the sun induces the magnetic field, a stronger field will cause the rotor to turn a little bit faster each revolution (accelerate). likewise, a weaker magnetic field will decelerate until it reaches a constant velocity proportional to its field strength -- assuming a constant load, of course.


### 2021-09-16 04:33 - go figure it out

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vik5dL1WfPw)

I have felt a lot of uneasiness going on around going to becky's house. there are a lot of assumptions and stuff.

about that -- the thing is, I think it's OK to talk about these concepts and stuff...

I just listened to the latest snake-bros podcast (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw9BVqDK4Qo)) and I'm totally digging that they're figuring it out for theirselves. they kind of invigorated my inner trickster a bit. I really like that they're doing all of their discovery and stuff. it's really good.

my whole thing is I want to open up the "spirit realm" (or whatever... conceptual realm) so that others can see it. once people begin to have interaction with that, I think a lot of these mysteries will become pretty understandable.

I kind of sit on the fence on this because on one hand, I want to give people magic wands so they can create all the crap they want -- thereby greatly accelerating the realisation that stuff isn't the goal. there was this one part in tesla's autobiography which always stuck to me about his gambling addiction. his mom gave him the money to spend, knowing that only by spending all the cash was the only chance to allow him to make his own decisions.

I'm of the opinion that you have to let people shoot themselves in the foot. it's essential to the learning process. this is the same way. while, I know that that would severely interrupt nosebook's desire to tell people what they can and cannot do, this realm is opposite of the physical one. you cannot do a lot of things here, so the limitation is resources. there, you can do anything you can imagine -- so the limitation is your creativity. almost all creativity is a remix of an existing idea, so this is all about trying stuff out, failing, revising and trying again.

it's a really difficult thing to figure out... if everything is possible, what do you try? imagine you were tasked with trying out the different combinations of DNA (a very large number) to create a new species... it's difficult to explain this concept easily...

in a slightly related incident, I was watching an [ontological discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXW-QjBsruE), and I noticed that I have very strong opinions about what things are and are not (very ironic joke considering the content of the video), and I had this realisation that it must be so annoying for people to hear me say, "no, it's like this ..." and then state my current understanding of the topic as if it were fact.

sorry, that's the way I am and I don't really want to try to see it any other way. I have to make some assumptions to make any progress -- otherwise I go in circles cause I can never be fully sure of anything. I do recognise there is uncertainty to the things I'm saying and my opinion changes all the time as I continue to find a more general implementation of the concept.

from my perspective, though I think my perspective is correct, I don't want to impose that perspective on anyone. I'm willing to offer my suggestions and my current understanding of it, but I don't want it to become doctrine. my own ideas change so rapidly, I could never afford to have something that I believe is unchangable. even source (or God, or supreme deity) I believe is also changing, expanding, and improving. there is nothing that is static and immovable.

so, even though I'm nearly 100% certain that there will be some beady-eyed opportunists that'll take some of the things that I say here and turn it into a system that reinforces their authority on the matter, I don't want to have any part in that. there are a lot of people that want to be told what to do and how it works, and those guys are for them.

those people are not for me. I'm willing to offer my ideas, but figure it out for yourself, ya know. I don't have all of the answers because no one ever will have it all figured out -- just better and better explanations of it.

I like that people are figuring it out for theirselves. I believe that's what this domain is actually designed to have.

---

the reason why I said that is because I was thinking about the custodians and stuff and how it all fits in here.

imagine for a moment that all of this is a simulation, and it's a sort of genetic algorithm designed to harden the system.

if a virus came to your system, knocked on the door and said, "I'm the good guy; let me in" your friend may ask, "how do you know he's the good guy?" "well, because he told me he was, of course" -- that sort of thing sounds silly, but that's about the extent of "security" people have with most channeling.

to make the game more difficult, LOA is a real thing, so you get what you're tuned to, so someone who is on the lookout for a monster around every corner is going to find a lot of monsters, and that distrust actually attracts them. it's like they can smell it. you want to be on the lookout for the desirable things. however, a person who is naive will also get duped a whole bunch of times too.

the system appears to be optimising for someone who is naive so as to attract desirable realities, yet can recover easily/rapidly from any setbacks. intuitive enough to recognse the undesirable without even interacting with it or attracting it in the first place, and also capable of figuring out the nature of reality as a reflection of them so they're able to amplify the desirable aspects.

that can probably be said in a better way. I'll think about it, but one thing I seem to be noticing is that the reality around us is in the business of deception.

---

I guess what I'm saying here is that I want to keep offering as many ideas as I can, which I'm sure are not *the way*. they are *a way* -- of many possible ways. nature loves redundancy. anyone who says they are the only one true way has drank the custodial koolaid and are part of the simulation designed to compromise the easily infiltratable.

all of these phenomenon are just mega amplifiers of your concept of reality. need a saviour -- the galactic guardians will save you from your crappy reality. want some power? try this ritual.. how about 200X boosting your internet connection?

lol.

### 2021-09-17 03:19 - and the lord spake unto moses...

...that *the LORD thy God* shall harden the heart of the pharoah and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land therein..

naw, just kidding... right? the last few days I've been continuing to lower my own resistance. the thing is, the whole girls thing doesn't feel as bad anymore, so I'm not really fighting it so much anymore.

I still think it'll be a rather bumpy ride though. my main reason for wanting to hold off for as long as possible is that I wanted to try and figure out my own way toward getting the mars thing going.

since, I've come up with the concept of passing on the magic wand. I thought maybe originally I wanted it to be invite-only, however I've changed my mind to making it a conceptaul thing. I still like the idea that girls can invite others to join the conceptual network, but I don't think that's a necessary thing anymore.

I still haven't worked out all of the details on that, but I do want for more replicas to be created, though I don't think this'll happen very soon.

what I'm learning is that this isn't necessarily a battle (it's not a battle -- just I don't have another word for it) of conditions, but instead a conceptual engagement. what I mean by that is kinda like what abraham would always say about conflict -- telling people to change their point of attraction (concept of reality) and those incompatible will vibrwate right out of your experience.

I started to think in @[newblog](2021-09-13 03:17) about the different things that would be detestible to nosebook as a way to try and force the egyptians out of egypt...

obviously that's not going to work and I would be attracting a similar sort of incompatible reality for myself as well. the original goal was a physical separation instead of a temporal one.

I pretty much came to the conclusion that there isn't anything that needs to be done actually. all that I have to do is follow the road that feels like the right way and course-correct as I go. doing that, I should get there OK.

so, I stopped having so much resistance, and it felt from my perspective like some people were very concerned about this. personally, I don't mind how long the pharoah's heart is hardened, because I'm really not in a rush at all.

so, I feel like I want to watch this video and lindsey is talking about the character arc of the little mermaid. I've never seen this movie before, so I don't have much context to go by either.

the first thing I noticed is her name. her name is aries with an l -- so, like a feminine mix of mars and saturn. she has a bunch of earthly books and wants to be a human. her father neptune (the original chief god of atlantis) forbids her from her books or something like that. he fights her desire for human knowledge. I don't know the story but neptune gives up his power to a witch.

this reminded me of the chimera -- a mythical beast having lion, goats and snakes. OK, so mythologically speaking atlantis (of which neptune was first ruler) fell about 12kya at the end of leo. the lion is always connected with this terrible and ferocious female goddess (innana, ishtar, sekhmet) having power over the lion and sometimes she is clothed with a lion's body -- always she has an attractive female body with the face of a male lion (drag king?).

the fact that this female influence coming and overthrowing the kingdom of neptune could not have been perceived by all as having been a good thing.

the chimera is also the offspring of typhon and echidna. in a previous nosedocs, I make the case that typhon is the destructive side of velcan. I also have implied that vulcan is likely another incarnation of saturn (satan).

anywaay, typhon and echidna give birth to a lot of monsters that heracles has to fight in his trip through the zodiac. also, I'd like to mention that I believe the suffix "cles" is like "ovich" meaning "son of" -- so like, son of hera -- which was also vulcan -- so like his counterpart, or the same guy. either way, the picture I get is that one makes the monsters and the other defeats them.

back to ariel. I don't really know how you mix two dudes to get a girl, unless you were a genetics superstar and could sew x chromosomes together to make an x2 or an x4 (depending if it's the immortal or physical twin).

anyway, I think I should probably watch the little mermaid. I'm surprised at how "prophetic" it is. that, and hercules, actually (see where I'm going with this?).

---

the next thing that caught my eye was when she says that ariel has a very simple charaacter arc. most disney protagonists go through the monomyth, but ariel knows what she wants and gets it. the entire struggle is external. I probably should hate identifying with a disney princess, but from what I gather, I see myself a lot in ariel.

I would assume that I'm not though.. like she's similar to me, but not me -- so, I had a look at the [monomyth](/img/monomyth.jpg). I noticed that I am heading down both the left and the right side of the chart there, and it appears that I'm gonnna meet right there in the middle at the temptation, right between "meeting with the goddess" and "attonment with the father" stages.

---

that's all I have to say for now. it wouldn't surprise me if some of the story gets a rewrite.

### 2021-09-18 02:42 - thinking on the rewrite

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qh7YV23aRY)

I just watched that and I noticed that the 12 labours of heracles are also quite similar to the future outline I lost in the disk crash, and also to the final stretch after the death of enkidu in the epic of gilgamesh.

there is one interesting part where when fighting the hydra, it seems to continue to regrow its heads during the traversal through cancer. after cancer, there must have been a reversal because now we're in saggitarius with the centaurs.

then, after clearing out a whole bunch of crap with a lot of water (flood?), he kills some birds and we're back to fighting bulls. this would seem to be taurus, but in my narrative I have this part ending in gemini. the labours seem to suggest that girls cause heracles many problems. the girdle gets the amazon girls killed. the next one has cattle causing problems again, and is somehow related to termenting heat. heracles threatens to kill the sun and is given a spaceship in return. he rounds up the cows and sets up two pillars (gemini?).

I don't believe that these cows symbols are of taurus because these cows seem to produce a lot of waste and need to be rounded up. perhaps the bull is related to taurus, but the cows I think are the feminine principal -- giving milk or sacrificed for food. the mortal female

finally the apples of the garden are to be fetched, and this is (IMO) the immortal female. in order to accomplish this, the sky needs to be held up (this seems to be a reference to the atlantians and their electrification of the sky). seems heracles almost fumbles the sky, and tricks atlas to holding it up again.

mission accomplished. he goes and celebrates and then get loose with women again. his wife, wanting to regain his love actually poisons him with hydra blood -- the snake tyrant that kept reproducing double instead of killing it. this I believe is a reference to "job" and the general principal that every force produces double (see story of gob). the hydra was good at returning what it lost in double proportions. well, this same capacity when applied to heracles, kills his mortal self (the end of gemini).

the last scene is cerberus, the 3-headed dog. I find it likely that sirius has a third star, and this is cerberus. this is the closest approach to sirius in the underworld. from there, we probably flip over and now back into scorpio or libra (dunno which one).

therefore I must conclude that the "opposition" to hercules is hera. she is an interesting character that I think is well portrayed (in modern eyes) by ursela (bear lady) in little mermaid. this opposition seems to drive heracles to perform these labours -- so therefore I will consider heracles in this context to be the martian task force, or gilgamesh. the cattle are symbolic of the earth humans. the amazonas are likely the more powerful females on earth.

consider this to be the frame for the rest of this discussion.

---

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/KznZcK7ksf4?t=974)

on the subject of superman vs rocky, to me, it feels like they're trying to move away from the superman christ-like narrative and move instead toward a rocky-like narrative for heracles, who was born with godlike powers -- just he needs to train to be able to use them. 

so, while I do identify a bit with heracles in this, I consider heracles to be the x3 models -- making my character hera :)

---

this presents an interesting difficulty because the rocky story is that rocky is the underdog that is going to fight heavyweight champion apollo. he lasts pretty long (like heracles), but in the end is defeated.

the superman narrative is weird -- and it also *does not* fit the martians either, so that won't work.

---

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIIWy3TZ1eI)

the final thing to discuss here is the hunchback narrative. I've never seen it and I never heard the story before tonight, so I'm a bit blind. some things to note is that the esmerelda reminds me of the "dark lady" sonnets -- more sexual than the "fair youth" sonnets/princesses.

the story is that the hunchback is the physically inferior to frollo. his name means "almost like" or I would say, "almost formed" or "almost there". frollo apparently means "killed by arthur". I also don't know anything on arthur, but I'm assuming that arthur is some super awsome dude that had the female power (holy grail), so frollo appears to be labeled as the jealous/inferior rival type of arthur.

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/AIIWy3TZ1eI?t=1656)

this sequence "it's fine" appears to me as a passing on of something... I will assume that esmerelda is the "holy grail", that he is passing it on to the new apollo (captain phoebus).

### 2021-09-19 23:53 - little more on the rewrite

I have been thinking about those story elements I talked about in the last few entries on the rewrite. even though I have some similarities to the hercules story (especially the disney one), I contend that this is the future story of the martians over the next 6ky, told symbolically through the form of heracles.

I do however have a lot more similarities to the rocky and quasimodo stories though. when thinking on the rocky one, his story is to train physically as hard as he can to defeat the heavyweight champion, apollo. he makes it all the way up to the last round but is ultimately defeated by apollo. quasimodo is similar in that he passes on esmerelda to apollo.

so I was thinking about the rocky story. he is training really hard to defeat apollo, but that training is physical. my situation is similar, but my goal is not physical strength, but instead the capacity to feel the way I want to feel, and then be able to be anything I want to be.

I was talking with mom about this, this morning and I was explaining how I feel a bit of a hypocrite because I talk about all of these things that I cannot do. if I truly could feel the way I want to feel, I wouldn't have trouble to pee. I could also navigate time very easily too.

these last few days provided two very clear examples of this too. the first was yesterday when I went to becky's and I simply could not eat all day. my stomach hurt and everything sounded terrible to me. I also had a very difficult time to pee.

the effects that this had were notable. I really felt very strongly how much disinterest I have in getting back to concerning myself with the mundane. I don't care about football, and I don't care about someone's inability to figure out how to feel good. none of that is anything that I want anything to do with. so, sure I can lower my resistance and perceive that all paths eventually lead toward the creating of the thing I want, for some reason I still feel strong distaste for a path that involves such a material/mendane approach to it. I want to feel the way I want to feel. the irony is, sure if I am placed in that situation, I can *definitely* feel the way I want to feel, it is not something that I think I would choose.

so again, I'm a hypocrite. I say to find a way to feel the way I want to feel no matter the circumstance, and then reject the circumstance because I don't feel good, instead of finding a way to feel good.

the second good example of this was today. I woke up and I was feeling pretty good. even though I did feel pretty bad, it was still quite an improvement over previous performances, and I did think I was doing better. when I woke up, I had a strong feeling that today was a trajectory toward something happening. it felt very strong to me. I think I then lost consciousness, and I can't remember the order of events, but one thing I remember is how uninterested I felt being stuck in a life with the mundane details of ordinary public school life. I also found my stomach was hurting quite a bit and I was very unable tco pee again.

however the order of events happened doesn't matter; when I returned back to consciousness, I really did not feel well at all. I even had a nosebleed, which is something that is very very uncommon for me (I have to get hit; it never just happens)

I'm pretty certain that the difference between how I felt before and after directly modified my trajectory through time (eg. switched timelines).

---

so, in the sense that I'm rocky, my objective is not to defeat my opponent physically, but to be able to feel the way I want to feel. it appears that their capacity to manipulate the physical aspects of my body still has an effect on how I feel emotionally/conceptually.

the other major realisation for me was that I realised that no matter what is happening, they'll always just adjest the way I feel to alter that trajectory. therfore, seems safe to say that nothing will happen with the girls until all timelines possible must traverse that event, so as to make it completely unavoidable.

---

so that brings me to my final point here. I'm getting better and better at feeling the way I want to feel, but I want to really master it. this isn't a championship title in that I only have to defeat them once. I have to be good at it so that it feels natural and normal for me to feel the way I want to feel. so, just like my star-watching, I'll probably get good at feeling the way I want to feel, keep doing it, but right before anything manifests, I'll just let the conditions carry the moment as everything seems to fall apart. this gives me and also others a chance to get good at feeling the way they want to.

there's nothing inherently wrong or bad about any of the conditions that people are in right now. it's just the perception of them that feels bad.

so, for example, today I was studying football. I don't want to fight against it, so I study it instead. it's funny how this ties right in to the conversation that I had with that guy on saturday about where I get my news: the conspiracy therists. I study the proposed bad guys and their objectives and then work my way back to reality.

well same thing here, so I take the thing I don't like (the mundane interaction of american football) and I study it to find my way back to reality. I noticed that there's a ton of bean-counting on time (time-shortage consciousness), and an official declaration of what happened (referee), and commentators on the action (fox/cnn news) complete with replays and analysis if the official declaration is correct or if there should be outcry.

it's exactly like american government and politics played out in real-life. I remembered the quote from mcluhan quote about how sport and games are modeled conceptually to illustrate the successful aspects of a culture's achievements and play them out in a structrued and organised form. american football is a game that is showing us how we have distilled our success and expansion into a game. this isn't a game of wit secrets, planning ahead, etc, like chess. it's a different game.

I propose that it's a game of propulsion. the goal is to push the ball through the resistance as forcefully as possible. sometimes it involves some trickery, but it's mostly brute force, of which you get 3-4 attempts to try and push it throgh an acceptable distance before being forced to give up and try to make it as hard as possible for the opposition to return the favour. I was watching the cowboys and the chargers, but it may as well have been repubicans and democrats, or USA and iraq.

interestingly, I was talking to the same guy about how our technology reflects our consciousness (another idea I lifted from mcluhan), and that we won't be able to progress much further technologically (especially space travel) until the propultion-only paradigm gets changed to one of attraction.

---

so, in a bigger picture of things, I can see that there are a lot of people out there that like to push things forward, whether it's mentally or physically -- so, while I do think it would be a great idea to have good conditions, with which we can all experience and enjoy, it appears that the manifestation that I want (to feel the way I want to feel) seems to be directly linked to that separation.

intuitively, I reasoned that I did not imagine that any girls would be happening until a separation has occurred -- either physically or temporally. I'm starting to see this playing out more and more all the time.

instead of trying to get any single event to manifest, I want to get so good at feeling the way I want to feel, that it doesn't matter what is happening.

I was thinking to stop talking about the difficulties, but the reality is, these are OK because my attention to them trying to manipulate my timeline by the way I feel is giving me more and more practise at it. they'll continue to get better at it too, and when we finally split, they'll be so good at it, apollo will have finally defeated me -- but not entirely because I'll be with a bunch of people that also know how to feel the way they want to feel.

because, love...

### 2021-09-21 23:11 - all or nothing: here's another way to make none

I have been thinking about what the origin of the present predicament is, and it appears to be that they desire to have my consciousness: that is, the way I perceive things. I think it allows for good deduction and reasoning and capability to perceive beyond just what is presented in the image. essentially, they like the way I perceive things *feels*, making everything feel more vibrant and alive -- however, but they don't want me to have that form of perception, because my capacity to feel makes it difficult for them to hide things.

yesterday, I was explaining that I believe kids (especially girls) have a similar capacity to perceive what others are feeling around them, however, they don't have a framework to put that sense into words or thought which would be recognisable to adults. I have the unique capability of having adult logic and reasoning capability while retaining the perception of a child.

after that, I started to get some reactions about an idea of transfering my consciousness into a kid. being stuck once again inside of a body that does not yet have a developed enough brain to translate that perception into words and ideas, they are once again safe from someone as perceptive as I am from explaining to adults in words what is plainly going on behind the illusion.

if I'm never given the ability to reach puberty or I come to all kinds of resistant conclusions during puberty like most do, then I'll never be able to translate that consciousness into anything meaningful.

the body is receiving a stream of consciousness from your source, and it is giving you all sorts of information about everything and everyone you're interacting with. as a child we learn to shut that down because adults tell us to not listen to that intuition (and instead listen to them). that consciousness source continues to flow even if the body is not capable of translating it into reality, so technically I believe they could continue to use my consciousness even if I never develop a body/brain capable of translating it into something meaningful.

---

I don't really mind if that's what they want to do. they could keep transferring my consciousness into newborns over and over, never allowing me to get to puberty. from my perspective, this doesn't make much of a difference because I won't be conscious for most of it. as soon as I start to gain consciousness, they'll just move me to another newborn again.

I imagine the feeling would be something how I experinece sleep right now. in my dreams, I know that ever time that I'm on the verge of becoming consciousness, something happens and it goes away. so, in that sense it would be also like sleep in that I don't really perceive any passage of time. I just lose consciousness and then I wake up -- even though a lot of time has passed while I was gone.

---

it also creates kind of an interesting effect in that I'm certain that even though I'm not conscious, my source will continue to try and find ways to become conscious. therefore, I imagine that I'll optimise the process to where I become conscious, finding ways to become conscious more and more rapidly all of the time. certainly, they'll have to find more and more difficult situations and parents to put me with, so it'll also optimise for undesirable conditions as well. if I were a plant, I would be a weed.

you can imagine how much desire this will continue to create to become conscious. I'm reminded of this thing -- where when a child has a desire and the parent tries to prevent it from happening. for most, they just forget about it -- however, for some they cannot just let it go and they *have* to have it (whatever it is). the more they want it, the more chaos and destruction begins to take place until the child is allowed to do what they want to do (this begins to become very noticable during puberty). that amount of desire to become conscious would continue to grow until it is allowed to happen. so, like even if you were to put me with difficult parents, their lives would fall apart until I was allowed what I want. desire is a powerful thing; the most powerful force in the universe, in fact.

so while I do think it would be a bit of a setback and a bit annoying to have to start over many times more to get to where I'm at now, again -- but, I don't doubt the power of desire. I'm pretty certain I'll find my way. I also think it's kind of a cool thing too, because humans are very fragile and rely a lot on a nurturing envirenment to survive the early years. in contrast, a deer may be walking around a few hours after birth, and a reptile or insect is fully ready to go after hatching, just needing to grow a little bigger.

this process would greatly reduce the time it takes for a human to gain consciousness. I can imagine being bern, and within a few hours I'm already floating around and taking on the form that I choose, and begin to try things out and go from there.

I guess I'm sorta down to take the hit here allowing them to continue to use my consciousness while I optimise the gaining consciousness phase of the human species. I guess it's sorta necessary to take over. soon there will be no separation between us. all children will be born directly into my form of perception and consciousness.

sounds like a worthwhile sacrifice so they can ensure I never become conscious enough to reveal their secrets -- I guess...


### 2021-09-22 02:44 - a bit of rationalisation

a bit of a reply to a few reactions wondering why in the world would I suggest such a thing...

well, it takes the whole "need not the manifestation" thing to the extreme. the last thing I want to do is to rely on a manifestation to feel good. this takes that and raises it to a whole nother level. I'm just not really concerned about it. the thing I want is to have the capacity to feel the way I want to feel. like... you know, however I want to feel, physically or emotionally. I'm learning very rapidly the techniques to do that every day, and literally every day I notice that I'm still learning new things.

it's a bit hard to describe them, as they're starting to get sufficiently abstract that it's difficult to explain them with words. the best way to say it perhaps would be a confidence or a knowing, coupled with a much more real-time awareness of how I feel. I still react and stuff so to the outside world it probably looks still about the same. to explain, imagine I bite my fingernails becaus I'm nervous. I could try and do my best to stop biting my fingernails, but the manifestation of that nervousness will appear in other places. that's kind of why I let those manifestations occur, because I get the evidence of how I feel instead of trying to suppress (or hide) it.

what I mean is, I'm finding form of perception which allow me to feel relaxed, rather that trying to change the nervousness.

the reason why this is important to me is because instead of trying to figure out the right thing to say or do or whatever, I can just be so practised at feeling the way I want to feel, it's effortless.

I don't really have to pay anything for it, other than time -- of which, I'm mosly unconscious anyway. it's truly one of those "improve yourself while you sleep" sort of gimmicks. I only had to come up with something so amazing someone is willing to invest a tremendous amount of time and effort into coming up with technology to prevent me from ever becoming conscious with it.

I have no rush to try and get any (specific) manifestation anyway. the ability to feel what I want *is* the manifestation. with that capacity I can manifest *anything* I want anyway -- instead of just one thing.

if someone comes to you and gives you a wish, you would wish to have unlimited wishes, right? hopefully, anyway... that seems the most obvious wish for me...

likewise, on the opposite side of things it's also quite good because it also allows for others to also not need a manifestation and feel the way they think the manifestation will allow them to feel.

---

so, why would I want to duck out early? well, it's that all or nothing thing. let's look at the sequence of events to try and derive some meaning from it...

1. I wanted to go for all because I didn't like the way it felt to have so many people depending on me for feeling good.
2. later, I realised that having people depend on me for how they want to feel is actually a fine thing when looking from a solar perspective.
3. I decided OK, fine I'll just go with some girls and work my way up to getting connected so that I can do all -- or, perhaps instead of that maybe we could figure out a way for the girls to be able to make their own replicas and make more for their friends
4. that idea was met with some difficulty, and there was a simple desync between the reality that I wanted to live and the reality I would be put into. I preferred the conceptual reality more than being forced to be physically focused.
5. because I am an adult, I can choose the reality that I want, and I suppose I'm a bit of a snob in that I'd rather not be stuck in a mundane reality of worry and appearance.
6. some revision into the story that is to be told was done. the conclusion that I came to is that #3 is the rocky story. that story parallels the hercules story a bit, which is similar to mine. however, the disney story has very little to do with the labours of heracles story, which I believe is the martians/gilgamesh's story after enkidu dies.
7. a second story of notre dame (our lady) is prposed where quasimodo passes on the dark lady to the new apollo. this parallels the rocky (the earth) holding out till the final round in it's battle against apollo (the sun). in both cases, the torch is passed on and requires a rewrite to accomodate this.
8. while contemplating the implementation of this, there was the sound of many motors a new water heater and a new idea manifested of transferring my consciousness into a child's body, forcing me to be physically focused in a material world determined by my parents (andrew and jessica?) where I'd depend on them, and have to learn reality through their framework
9. sure, it's definitely annoying to start over, but I can see the advantage of getting the practise to finding a way to feel the way I want to feel. andrew (or whomever) will almost certainly provide a difficult enough challenge to fuel that desire.

it's not like it's the best sequence to give it meaning but it solves all of their problems, and only creates a few more. let's go over them here...

solutions:
1. I am no longer capable of revealing secrets because I can't even speak english or have the ability to construct a meaningful thought because my brain hasn't developed enough to do so.
2. no longer do they have to worry about me seeing images. I simply don't have the capacity from birth, so it's not like it's even a thing.
3. entire portions of my brain can be disabled and certainly I'll still find a way. no worries if that produces paralysis or inability to pee. again, if I'm born that way, then the brain figures out how to perform the task within the framework it's given.
4. I get to become completely unstoppable. obviously, this won't last forever; I will find a way.
5. if I make my transition now, I believe the earth's magnetic field will severly weaken. I don't know if this is dsetermined to be desired or not. this will allow the earth to begin to rotate in the opposite direction.
6. considering the traditional way of accomplishing someone else's form of perception through sex, there will be zero girls that got my perception the natural way. they will only have got it through nosebook (which likely has a limited featureset and is heavily controlled). this eliminates a uncontrolled spread of my perception to others

problems:
1. I get to become completely unstoppable. obviously, this won't last forever; I will find a way.
2. who will they broadcast in my place? they could broadcast the kid, I guess but that may not be as exciting. I dunno.
3. andrew may not want to be broadcasted
4. if they reveal they have the capacity to transfer consciousness, that may be undesirable. or, perhaps the healthcare industry could find a way to capitalise on moving their consciousness instead of keeping those dead people alive.
5. if I make my transition now, I believe the earth's magnetic field will severly weaken. I don't know if this is dsetermined to be desired or not. I think increased magnetic field means more perception/energy and faster speed of light. I also think it means shorter days as rotation speeds up.

more to think about still...

### 2021-09-22 11:12 - transferr of consciousness

I first began to think about this idea a lot when I found out that terence died at nearly the same time that I had a brain haemorrhage. I know I'm not him but I figured there could be a method to transfer some portions of consciousness between people in altered states of consciousness during death.

later on, I found out that both during birth and death, the brain has extremely high levels of DMT in it. I know that I too have higher than normal quantites of DMT in my brain regularly. I equate levels of DMT to be quantity of non-physical (desire, perception, etc) one is capable of transmitting. this also happens when you dream, and one will know that an ayahuasca trip is very different than a dram (though still similar). the reason why they're so different is because the dream is DMT that you produced and is therefore tuned to your source. the ayahuasca (or mushroom) DMT is tuned to the consciousness/source of that plant which is why similar quantites of DMT from different sources produce very different experiences.

I have concluded that during both birth and death you are the most allowing of your source.

#### what is your source?

start with a seed and consider that the "source" of the plant encoded into physical code. if you plant the seed in one set of conditions, it will grow up one way. plant it in another environment, it'll grow up looking and behaving differently depending on those conditions. imagine yourself as similar to tme plant.

now, as you go through life, you encounter difficculties. those difficulties produce a desire to superar those difficulties with greater and greater ease. you have a concept of yourself. this is the thing that produces the image of yourself. this is your physical concept of yourself. your non-physical concept of yourself is your source. that is an amalgamation of desire and other things we would consider mental tasks (logic/structure/implications). the physical concept of yourself has to find a way of keeping up with the non-physical concept of yourself.

the way I believe this works is, the body is tuned to a source signal and that signal (from our perspective) is constant and unique[^1]. the body/automaton has to find a way to stay in sync with that signal. obviously that would be impossible for a baby to do right away, so our DNA is designed such that the different faculties allowing one to translate more and more of this source signal into reality slowly become activated.

I place these roughly into 11 year cycles (and corresponding 5.5y and 2.75y cycles[^2]) and as more and more of these faculties come online the more conscious and capable of translating non-physical energy into physical reality manifestations you become.

if you can keep up with the non-physical concept you have of yourself meanwhile these faculties are coming online, then you will continue to grow. if you can't maintain sync with that concept, then these faculties will slowly begin to fail, eventually resulting in death.

I saw an interesting phenomena on youtube that rupert sheldrake presented called "terminal lucidity". what I think is happening there is during the dying process, the parts of the body which hold memories/perceptions which keep a person out of sync (althsheimers, dementia, etc) begin to deactivate, allowing the person a greater amount of consciousness (higher levels of DMT). this higher level of consciousness doesn't usually change the sickness so the body continues to deteriorate and consciousness continues to rise. I think this is also the reason for NDEs as well. when the body is no longer actively blocking the reception of its source with its perception, memory, etc. it allows the person to become superconscious for a moment and resync their perspective a bit.

---

anyway... as more and more parts of the body responsible for resistant forms of perception and memory die off, more and more of one's source is allowed, raising the levels of DMT in the brain.

likewise, when the baby takes its first breath, there is a tuning of a source signal (or signals) -- likely resonant with the people, oxygen, etc. in the environment -- tuning the body to a compatible source.

---

my experience of getting tuned to the source of another may have happened when I was born, but I don't remember that. the other experiences were likely in the hospital after the brain haemorrhage and in vallecas.

so, it is possible to acquire other sources after birth, I think birth is the easiest and the one I want to focus on.

the way that nosebook does it may be different, because I think they're interested in retaining a lot more resistant ideas. I'm not interested in keeping those around. for example, during the time of the saturnian golden age, I think energies were so high that if you died, you would leave your body, fly around till you found a new body that you liked, and then influence it so it feels like you do and can then "walk-in" and posess that new body for yourself (likely evicting the old soul).

this is not what I'm talking about, as that method was designed (probably on purpose by saturn) to allow them to continue to incarnate into bodies without dying.

---

this method of tuning to the brain of the baby to the brain of the person dying really only is a technological capacity that is starting to become available. it requires the syncronisation of births and deaths and other things.

I don't want to get too bogged down with the marketing details, as that's a job for the amun priesthood. my goal is to say that when you die, all of the stuff that was preventing you from keeping up with that concept of yourself dies with it. the best opportunity to transfer a consciousness from one to another retaining only the non-resistant concepts is this way. like I said. I'm sure they have a method for transferring resistant concepts between bodies, but that's not my goal. I like the idea of starting over like that.

---

there are other interesting applications for this as well. assume for a moment that we recognise the capability of tuning into people's consciousness at a point in the past -- well, then you could also tune into their death too. if you want the baby you're carrying to contain parts of different people's sources, then tune the baby to those people's deaths during the first breath.

the other place this is good for doing is, imagine that you're running a new "realty" show based off of the nosebook network and you want specific actors. tuning the truman show babies to the composite actors death will produce a baby tuned to the composite improvements on the previous actors.

[1]: the variations are too small to even be measured by us, and when we get the capability to measure those variations now, source will already be out of our reach frequentially. they're growing as fast as we are and always out ahead. we can never catch up completely. if this happens, the universe will make it's transition

[2]: this is why I believe your logical capabilities start to kick in at 11, 13 is when puberty is starting to really be felt, and 16 is when you're considered conscious enough to drive responsibly

### 2021-09-22 22:44 - 11y solar cycle

after writing that I think the human progresses on an 11y cycle, I had the sense to check to see if the sun has an exact 11y cycle. my intuition said no, and I also really wanted to look up jupiter's orbit period. turns out it's 11.862y long. I look up the solar cycles and wikipedia shows a pretty convincing graph of solar cycles beginning with 12 back in 1878. before that, I will consider the data to be unreliable. wikipedia also says that the cycle starts dec 1878, and cycle 24 ending in dec 2019. a simple calculation reveals that 2019-1878 is 141y for 12 cycles. 141 / 12 = 11.75

that's close enough for me. what that means is that jupiter's orbit is related to the solar cycle. I then remembered an animation I saw about the 720 degree spin of an electron.

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/pWlk1gLkF2Y?t=569)

btw, when I just opened that, my views count is "1,444,044" -- weird coincidence I guess..

anyway, looking at the animation, pay attention to the ribbons connected at the equator and imagine that one of those is jupiter and instead of the cube rotating, the ribbons are rotating. see how the ribbon goes above, then below the cube. imagine the cube is the sun and it should all make sense now (woulda been even more cool if it were a black cube too).

---

I believe this has something to do with the ancient legends of jupiter dethroning saturn as the solar deity. likewise it's quite reasonable to think that at one time when uranus rotated upright, he had a stronger magnetic field and therefore was the solar deity.

what I mean is that the ancients must have known that the solar cycle is coupled to the planet with the strongest magnetic field.

---

I also noticed that the faster spinning planets have higher hydrogen concentrations, with the more dense elements being converted to hydrogen. this must be the alchemical (purification) proceess that planets go through on their quest to transform into a pure and perfect sphere star.


### 2021-09-22 23:18 - transferring consciousness again

get your speculation goggles on for this one :)

I had a few reactions wondering how the transfer of consciousness works. this is going to be very unscientific because I don't have any real data to go with. I'm fairly certain that I was likely a transferred consciousness likely at conception to kind of begin the trajectory, then perhaps at birth too. I think the conception one was of very resistant consciousness, and then at birth I had gained a consciousness more similar to the one I have now. I think the brain haemorrhage was also another big change. I may have been tuned to various consciousnesses then (I specifically remember interacting with a being I identified as jesus). I also had a pretty serious change again right before the "foster the people" concert in berlin; lot's of time missing and I felt very strange and a forboding distance to raquel afterward, too. I'm 100% certain that I picked up another or many consciousnesses in 2013 during the vallecas episode, too.

I would also count the time with vera (cause I felt like marcos afterward) and my first time in the brothel as having similar feelings as well. regarding the one with marcos, I often have wondered if after making the decision to sabotage a timeline, how many people would build conceptual programs to control their body and then transfer their consciousness into my body and ride along experiencing this reality as if they were me.

what I mean to say is that this subject is less of a defined "me" and "you" and is much more of a gradient. from your source's perspective, you're actually free to experience any perspective inside of the universe you desire -- just you are experiencing this one because it is the most interesting to you (addicted to this reality, or want to accomplish something or whatever). the reality is, we're all much more of a conglomerate of sources that we then decide, this is where me begins and me ends.

this subjuct of "who is me" is about the same as the discussion of "do chairs exist?" (reference to vsauce video in @[newblog](2021-09-16 04:33)). it's hard to know where you begin and end. you define that yourself and say these cells are "me".

---

I have memory of what it's like to be very young now, and I think it's only because of my predicament. the way I remember it is that I find myself in a space. I guess you could consider it black, but it's not necessarily any colour. it can be any colour and transforms and moves dynamically with thought. I have superconsciousness in that I know everything that's happening around me. I can feel my environment and everyone in it. I'm mostly curious to why they feel so strangely.

I begin to get sensations and at first I don't know what they are. weeks later, I'll begin to start to feel the physical touch, but for now I just feel the people touching me, not physically yet but conceptually. I know everything about them and can sense their intentions.

I suppose from the parent's perspective, I'm reacting strangely to the things they're doing. from my perspective, I react to things I feel and no one can see what I see. the parents just hear crying.

most of the time is spent reacting to things. slowly I'm beginning to communicate what I can perceive better and better into ideas and then later words. I remember that I think that everyone can feel what I feel and understand what I'm thinking. obviously, they cannot but I try anyway. to me it looks like I'm explaining a full concept to them. to them, it probably looks like disobedience or crying.

from what I can remember, I don't really start seeing out of my eyes and moving my body intentionally for quite some time. I don't really know how I learned to walk, but I feel like it was more like 5 or so wben I started to move my body directly instead of just thinking to go there and then waiting for my body to catch up.

I feel like I existed mostly outside of my body for the majority of my early years, mostly confused as to what it was doing and what was happening around me. it feels to me like I operated my body kind of like it was an automaton.

as time went on, I started to see mere and more out of my eyes and I was beginning to be convinced that the body that I'm looking out of is "me". when I think, it moves and other stuff. lots of stuff excites me as I interact with my world and everything feels like there's so much new and exciting things to do.

my most difficult thing was trying to figure out why some things made me feel bad. I always wanted to do the good-feeling stuff, but I had some blocks that prevented me from a lot of them because I couldn't understand what I was feeling.

---

the major thing to take away from this is that I did not really start moving my body deliberately till very late and I didn't become conscious of my emotions until even later. I was mostly confused for most of my childhood reacting to my circumstances.

I was very perceptive, so I could easily feel my parent's responses to me and when they were trying to give me orders that didn't feel good. I remember that I would follow my intuition, but that would get me into trouble, so I had to follow their commands. however, I wanted good commands where if I obeyed them, then I was good. that wasn't always the case. sometimes it was impossible to follow their commands and get a good result. not following their commands also yielded a bad result too.

I started to keep things a secret they wouldn't like and tell them what they wanted to hear. like, I knew when to tell on my siblings and when not to. over time I figured out that it was better to do what needed to be done (instead of disobeying), but to also be sure to tell them what they wanted to hear. I forget how long my no (want to) phase lasted, but I found it to be inefficient to get the results that I wanted.

I later became more and more results oriented, which made it difficult for me to understand my emotions. now, however I know much better, and it's quite likely most of my training this time around will stick, and I know that my results are reflective of how I feel, not what I'm saying or doing.

---

it seems plainly obvious to me that I want to find a way to carry that knowing that what I feel is more important. this will allow me to continue to operate my body from a feeling standpoint, just feeling the objective that I want and allowing my body to do the work, without needing to get so tangled up in the physical senses so much.

I noticed that the more I felt physically, the less I felt emotionally.

I'm kind of excited to try and get good at this. almost certainly, this document will persist some time and people will use it as a reference to try and keep me as physically focused as possible, trying to ensure that I don't get so much esp again like I have now.

as much as they want to try and keep me physically focused, my goal is to continually try to make my reality an emotional/conceptual one rather than a physical/material reality with only actions and meaning to separate the components from the interactions.

it may take me a while to figure it out and a lot of conflict in the process, but bring it on :)

---

hopefully that helped to explain the transfer of consciousness. the main reason why it's so difficult to articulate it, is that we are so used to thinking that the stuff people say is real, unless they're lying -- but it's a gradient of things, and units are perceptual. there isn't a unit of truth and not everything is a binary one or the other. the unit is relative to your perception. you define if the sickness or oldness is "you". you are the unit which best fits your form of perception.

I was always surprised to get called by mom to dinner or whatever because as a child, when I was playing the game, I *was* the game. getting called back into "me" felt like a huge jolt.

### 2021-09-23 01:13 - thoughts of where it may have begun

this one is going to need the speculation goggles again. there is so much convoluted information, I simply cannot really ever know for sure. neither does it matter either. my job is just to find a way to feel good no matter the circumstances.

I had some reactions to the beginning part about the conception and birth. I honestly don't know. the best I can figure, I'm one of the "automatons of contrast" that I wanted to create. I don't know where it begun, but tesla talks in 1903 of communicating with mars, and says that he believes conscious life is out there -- then nothing. complete radio silence. I figure he must have got into contact with something. somehow he must have figured out how to communicate with source (not too much different than esther/abraham)

personally, I believe that it's possible to communicate using technology (and other psychic things like remote viewing) with planets, stars, galaxies, the deceased, and even source. it's just tuning and a willingness to communicate on their level rather than trying to bring them down to yours.

I don't know where I originate from or any of that, but it doesn't matter. I imagine a situation where tesla is figuring out how to move around inside of time, and he needs someone he can use to influence timelines. he sets up the conditions and then tunes me into a body and off I go. manipulate the circumstances to adjust my trajectory and it's possible to make a lot of things happen.

what I'm saying is that a lot of the custodial influence could easily have been me. he would just need to incarnate me into a body and give me the conditions necessary to produce the outcome desired.

I don't know if it is or not, but I figure I could have easily have been hitler, constantine, various roman emperors, mystics, etc. a lot of these custodial influences that bramley talks about could easily be me considering how conditional I am. I just optimise for the result I desire, and that can be influenced pretty easily, I imagine.

it seems strange, even to me that I want to make a galaxy so badly. when it comes to my personal development, I can clearly see that I want to feel the freedom to feel *any* way that I want, good or bad, and I can still find my way through it, oozing creativity and novelty because that's a reflection of who I am. just put me in a situation and off I go. I find my way no matter what.

---

what I think is happening is I'm being offloaded here. seems I was used to create an environment capable of needing tesla's creations (you gatta want them) and that was good for me because I expanded a lot in the process.

the semite/atlantian custodians were supplanted by the aryan custodians. I must have been involved with the atlantian custodians, but I don't know to what extent. I likely built a lot of technology and stuff cause I like technology and creativity... the aryans had to supplant the atlantians and make way for the new ones... I'm going to call them the aquarian custodians.

this, I believe is what is happening. the aryans incarnated me into bodies to affect the timeline the way they wanted it to go. now, the baton is being handed to the aquarians. from my perspective, I'm getting too good at feeling the way I want to feel now, so I'm not as useful to play custodial roles because I'm less and less conditional all the time and I'm too difficult to control easily. this is probably why physical stuff doesn't really motivate me much, and I long to return to being creative again.

seems the world system setup is capable of controlling my conditions pretty good, so the aryans are passing me off now to next custodians. they have to find a way to keep me forever in an endless cycle of contrived emotions (like the movies). if I find my connection, their secrets are revealed and everything falls apart, so they have to keep incarnating me into bodies over and over finding more and more difficult circumstances and influences to try and keep distracting me from becoming conscious of who I *really* am.

they want what I have, but never for me to have it too.

---

I guess I'm ready to start any time. I have no idea what all of the constraints are or any of that. I'm going to continue to keep practising my technique. I'm in no rush to get connected. I'm mainly concerned with improvement of my technique.

soiler: we all have a common source and we're only limited by our perception.

disclaimer: this entry is not likely to be accurate. I don't feel very certain about it and there is at least some discomfort. so, speculation is advised.

final disclaimer: not all aryans are custodians. neither are all atlantians/semites custodians. neither are all aquarians custodians. I'm specifically referring to the ones that think they "own" the place, are custodians of the planet, the nanny/babysitter to keep the reckless humans from killing theirselves... etc.


### 2021-09-24 13:27 - initial thoughts on tychos model

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyrNmOmJbEE)
[tychos website](http://www.tychos.info/)
[tychos planetarium](https://codepen.io/pholmq/full/XGPrPd)

I have a number of things to say about it, so I'll try and do so in an orderly fashion...

#### they're committing data fraud, so we're right

beginning to read through the book I can't help but to notice a lot of "they're wrong" (and so we're right) sorts of arguments being made. this is usually a red-flag for me to note custodial activity. it's a common technique that they use to shoot down or sidestep anyone with "unexplained phenonema".

however the idea doea resonate with me so I'm not willing to just dismiss it as another psy-op to obfuscate the truth. after watching an interview with the authors of the theory (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxnH3oPoc3I)), multiple times they try to illustrate how wrong the present capernican model is and it's a bit jaring. any respectible scientist would know how large a change away from a heliocentric model would entail.

they illustrate that observational astronomy does not really exist and numbers are massaged to fit the prevailing idea of how the system works.

I don't disagree. I believe this is the same problem with cimate change. it's very difficult to see any real historical data of temp, wind speed and pressure over time and space. instead, all we have are models of what that data *should* look like. if tony heller is right, even that data is being adjusted to fit the model, too.

this sort of technique to manipulate the data to conform to the image being sold is called marketing and it's being done in governments, power structures, and commerce since the beginning of time. we even commit this same fallacy in every greeting when we tell people things are "good" or "fine". we're trying to convince people of the image that wants to be presented more than the reality. so, no big deal. we all do it to some extent and I don't think this behaviour will ever go away until we turn into robots. all art is based on this principal of making something look another more abstract way.

so, from my perspective, no big deal. fighting the past feels like fighting. that's not what people want to feel when they get the idea. I think this idea needs a rebranding to feel like a whole new world or prerspective is opening up.

I don't think it's necessary to use custodial marketing techniques to sell a good idea.

#### custodial fingerprints

the story of kepler rewriting brache's idea to tell you that once again you are not the centre of your universe, but instead are just the lowest rank in a vast heirarchy above you is such a custodial trope, this whole thing just shouts custodial activity to me.

this is the maverick that has an idea which allows the common person to perceive theirself as separate from the heirarchy, which must be stopped. whether you believe that moses, jesus, martin luther, joseph smith, muhammed, or whomever had an authentic idea that was then manipulated and turned into morals, dogma, and religion... I believe that someone has systematically gone through history and removed as much evidence for people's perception of physical conditions as a means for enlightenment.

I'm kind of in agreement with the custodians and don't really find them to be much of a problem. in a world where things push against other things, it appears they have done massive amounts of damage. however, in a world of attraction, they did not cause any damage at all. they just presented an illusion which people believed and then attracted their own misfortune.

if everything is relative to everything else and there isn't a central axis upon which everything revolves -- as this theory tries to show, which is that everything has at least one strongly interacting companion -- then, that means our perspective of how things are moving is also constantly changing/improving over time because there is no central axis around which truth revolves.

if people were only presented with correct ideas, they would be able to recognise fraud, but that assumes that central axis. instead, it's better to assume that we have to constantly update that concept/perception/model when new data comes in. therefore, it's better to have the agility to rapidly update the concept.

from the custodial perspective, they need people who believe in an absolute truth, because those people can be lead to believe that their truth is the absolute truth. any resistance can be overcome with persistent presentation of an image ("facts") and the passage of generations because the children grow up naievely believing what they're taught is true. the more people that believe their narrative, the more power they have. it doesn't matter the narrative; it just needs to be something that they can control (so they can change it) or predict (so they appear right and credible).

from my perspective, I think none of this matters and is largely a distraction. no one is going to ever gain enlightenment or find happiness with the right climate model or planetarium.

#### earth's perspective

after looking at this model, what it reminds me a lot of is the idea that you can create any (1d) waveform over time with an infinite set of sine waves (which are one axis of a circle). there are also these drawings that show how an infinite set of constantly rotating circles (epicycles) can produce any (2d) curve over time as well (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY4luNgGfms)).

I consider this to be the case for this model. considering these epicycles, modern astronomy is trying to describe the curve with the sun in the centre, while this is trying to take into account as many circles as we can see, and it shows with pretty good accuracy how things appear to be interacting with us from the perspective of our circle.

the way I see it is this chain of circles, but instead of just a 1 to 1 between circles, each circle can have other circles as moons going around them.

we don't really know if we get out far enough that we our solar system cluster is actually the "moon" of another body. it could also be one of those p-orbits.

#### what about comets?

I wondered about this. clearly some comets don't have a circular orbit. thouugh upon further thought, I don't think that everything in the system has a circular orbit. I think that just the things which have a stable resonance (standing wave?) would have these circular orbits. my intuition says that getting a circular orbit likely has to do with the property that the object is producing its own vibrations and is no longer having just a trajectory of its reactions to past interactions.

further inquiry here.

#### interaction with sirius

one of the "problems" with this model is that I believe that we are interacting with sirius, and that perhaps many other stars are too. my intuition also believes that there is a very small (probably planet sized) and very high density third star (sirius c) in the main sirius system.

we don't really know what produces these circles, and I posulate that planets are different to stars in that they have a real geometry to them (like the earth and the chestahedron), whereas a sun is a sphere that produces its geometry from the magnetic interactions between them. planets, I believe go from more dense elements toward the lighter ones (gas giants). this purification process produces a planet that looks and behaves like a sun, but is not a sun. because it has a real geometry to it (y-chromosome), it is sort of like the "driver" to the sun.

I believe that the two main stars which I will call aphrodite (sirius a) and isis (sirius b) also have a driver and that is this super high frequency theird one which I think I'll refer to as menkaure or khnum (sirius c). I'll come back to this.

point is, I believe the composition of the body determines its frequency and geometry. heavier elements usually emit lower frequency and lighter elements emit higher frequencies. density is a product of attraction. a rocky planet does not need to have strong attraction or magnetic field to stay together, but a gas giant, composed mostly of hydrogen, does.

khnum, for example, I believe has (in our concept of gravity) an unbelievably dense composition of very light elements, but still retaining a lot of heavier elements as well, giving him a very broad frequency range of absorption with retransmission in high frequency ranges (like a focal prisim). however isis and aphrodite are much more visible and emit light more suitable to sustain life.

---

our interaction with sirius may be something like a comet, but actually after having given it some thought, I think we may actually be in a p-orbit around the sirius cluster, similar to something like jupiter, saturn or pluto.

more investigation is needed.

#### venus and the moon's effect on the epicycles

if we look at our solar system as epicycles, then the moon appears to be the furthest one out in the system. if we removed the moon from the system, the entire system would behave differently.

in ancient literature, it talks about a time of 360 day years, but the maya actually have a 260 day year, and this could have been the case before we had the moon. the addition of the moon completely changed the dynamics of the entire solar system.

also, it talks of a time when there was only a 360 day year. I wonder if this change have occurred when the sun captured venus as one of its moons.

#### dance with mars

the second "problem" with this model is with my desire to couple ourselves to mars.

I don't really see it as a problem though. if mars is the driver for the sun, then the driver for earth is the moon.

the other thing I believe is that earth is going through a transition where it's going to begin to shed a lot of its higher density elements and we'll turn into something that resembles something more like the sun does. it's actually my belief that it'll be pretty similar to my description of sirius c (khnum).

so, now we come back to the triads. consider that the earth to be the female (isis 2.0) with just a single planet as the driver (moon), the earth will need a second driver. I propose this to be mars.

because we don't really understand attraction, it's hard for us to model and predict these epicycles, but I have to wonder what it would look like if the earth were to have two moons: mars and the moon. mars and the moon would rotate around us like mercury and venus orbit the sun.

that idea kind of goes in contrary to the mushroom galaxy idea

#### triads

it occurred to me that triads may be the norm. we see them as "binaries" because they are nurturing somethingt in the centre. so, imagine that sun and mars are a married couple and earth is the child. mars appears like a "bad father" destroying himself during earth's childhood. earth then has to grow up without a father (or abusive oppressive father, depending on what myths you subscribe to).

the growth cycle of the planet is to grow up and eventually shed most of its heavier elements and become a strong attractor on his own. if the hold the child in the centre, once the planet has become a strong attractor on his own, then when the female sun gives birth to a new dense planet, he can catch it and hold it while it matures. from the parent planet's perspective, it appears like his job is to counteract all of the outside influences such that to the child planet, it appears to be the centre of its universe.

wow, this model has completely opened a whole new perception of stellar activity for me... so cool!!

### 2021-09-25 23:49 - shedding of concrete reality

lately I have noticed that I have had a bit more of a difficult time holding this sort of ordered reality -- as in, I used to queue up a bunch of tasks for myself and then I could execute them, like I would remind myself to take something upstairs next time I go up, and that reminder would trigger when I was going to go upstairs. I imagine that hearthstone players use these sorts of triggers when they're playing to check for all of the possibilites that the opponent could be doing. you know, like "lol order" things.

thing is, I get so focused into what I'm thinking about, that it's very hard to feel those reminders anymore. as a result, because I want to still have a feelingt of order in my life, I have to continue to find ways of lowering the intensity of my thoughts. I use humour to stay light-hearted but it's not as effective because there needs to be something to laugh about.

in general, I would say that all of my memory faculties are also diminishing as well. seems I mostly only have problems remembering things that are not really that important. they may have seemed important, but they're not. like, I was just watching a documentary on pompei and he showed a picture of isis with a crocodile under her feet. there's another god that also has a crocodile under their feet too, but I can't remember who. the only thing I can remember is that it was associated with the period of time when I believe we went from scorpio to taurus and then the sun was then put on top of the bull (or hathor).

point is, I normally would have been able to remember those sorts of details very easily, however they feel like they're there in essence but the physical details that constructed that concept are not hanging around.

slightly related, I noticed how terrible/different I felt after opening up my email and seeing the abraham now broadcast notifications and the howtube response... those feel like ancient history to me at this point -- a very long time ago -- and, returning to remember them did not feel so good. had I not have opened my email, I wouldn't have tuned into the past with those physical details.

what appears to be happening is, my memory is being hyper consolidated into abstract versions. if I look at something from my past, then it's sort of like it transports me back there a moment.. I actually think that the incredible progress that I have been making the last few months has actually been because I *didn't* have a computer.

one day I was explaining to dad what it's like with the analogy that many people are staring at the forest through a window rather than walking through it. neither am I walking though it, but most people are so busy complaining about the spots on the window, they don't even see the beautiful forest out there. other people are admiring the forest and observing it. I don't really see all the minute and beautiful details, instead I seem to perceive it in a way which it looks to me like I understand how the forest works. I see processes, cycles, trends, species, and archetypes. stuff like that.

as a correlary to this consider the relationship between meaning and concept. if I start with a concept like "beautiful car", that can have many incarnations of that concept with various implementation details which would be described as a "beautiful car". likewise, if I were to look at a number of different cars, I could identify certain details as imparting the car with the concept of "beautiful".

consider that second example in everyday life and notice that certain details of someone's behaviour or appearance will imply something. I consider these implications to be "meaning". when observing carefully, one will notice that these details are also themselves concepts. a collection of concepts means something.

---

there were considerable number of reactions to something I said in my last entry about the alchemical process of a planet sheding its higher density elements and the implication that this is what I think is also beginning to happen here on earth.

I don't pretend to know what the physical manifestation of this is, but what I do know is that the process for the human is where reality starts to become a dream-like state where reality is a reflection of how you feel. all "matter" is no longer as dense in that state of being as it is in this physical space. what I mean is, if I feel a bar of gold (a very dense material) in my hand, it's there. then, as soon as I feel it as iron, it turns to iron.

if one were to take the gold bar from my hand, it would be gold -- like the same stuff that comes out of the ground. the structure is the same, but it took on that form effortlessly.

science does not make the claim, but I will... the sun is producing massive amounts of all of the elements from nothing more than the lighest element we know of, hydrogen and magnetic fields.

so, what's the difference between the sun's gold and my mental gold? energetic inertia. the look the same, behave the same and for all practical purposes are the same. the sun's gold has been a long time in the making, while my mental gold only maintains it's structure for as long as I can feel it there.

---

so, does that mean that I think that out entire reality will become completely temporary and unstable? not at all. if I had to guess, our reality will look and feel exactly like we believe it to be, which is looking like earth does, however the concept that we have of those physical details will start to become a bit slippery.

my guess is that we will maintain all things that are important to us. so, for example, if I have the idea that I have beautiful skin, that skin can perhaps be any colour to anyone, as long as it conforms to the concept of beautful skin. I do wonder if DNA sequences would vary for the same cell, requiring the sequence to conform to the perception of those performing the test. lots of interesting things can be tested there.

what I'm trying to say is that in our form of perception, it will look like earth does with oceans, mountains, jungles and animals, but to those that do not maintain the same form of perception as we do, it'll look like a chaotic ball of hydrogen. simply put, those hydrogen elements only assimilate a reality resonant with our perception.

lol, yes, there could be entire places that exist here on earth that we simply don't see because we don't resonate with that reality. places like skinwalker ranch may be those types of places, actually.

---

the idea is actually very exciting for me. normally, I would be kind of concerned that my focus is now so strong that it's getting difficult to remember mundane reminders I have for myself, but I'm realising that this magnetic reality is beginning to become difficult to avoid maintaining my focus on it, this is simply the beggining of the transition into a fully mentalised reality becoming persistent.

I believe the transition of this planet is somewhat inevitable. there are a few things I also would also like to take a look at. first, energy will continue to rise. I believe this has to do with the magnetic field. not all magnetic fields are created equally though. the oscillating magnetic field of an electromagnet is different from a non-oscillating magnetic field like a permanent magnet. the earth's magnetic field is relatively weak, but I believe it oscillates at a number of higher frequencies in addition to the day/night cycle oscillations. I also belive these oscillations are characteristic of the physical manifestation of emotions, and is the reason why different places on earth "feel" different.

as the magnetic field continues to increase, emotion will continue to increase in intensity as well. this may have some pretty intense effects. I believe nosebook is trying to minimise some of these effects turning into manifestations, but it's sort of inevitable that this will continue to increase. I think that the safe bet for those that want to have a strong magnetic field, but not too strong may find mars to be a pretty safe place.

---

actually, this topic actually kind of answered one of my own questions about how people, plants and animals managed to survive various past cataclysms. imagine that the sun sends out a massive amount of hydrogen out and it hits the earth's magnetic field. the magnetic field of earth will reverberate resonant with the consciousness of earth. during the impact, the earth will be in a very energetic state with an extremely high induced magnetic field from the impact.

all consciousness that is resonant with the consciousness of the earth will find theirselves in an environment that I claim will be similar to the one that the earth will soon have where the environment is more and more filled with protons and the reality all consciousness experiences (plants, animals, and insects alike) all becomes a reflection of their vibration. those that are thriving, continue to do so, and those that feel they are in danger, are in fact in danger. some believe they need to survive and so they experience a reality that they need to survive.

gradually as energies begin to lower down again, these realities begin to coalesce into something meaningful again -- as the frequencies of each version of reality begin to merge, it takes the path chosen.

so, like for example if someone walks into the room super pissed off and I never even notice that they're there or any of the pissed-offness, then my version of reality is dominant, and they live in my reality rather than me living in theirs.

imagine two people are both in the rockies and one experienced an enlightenment experience and constructed a beautiful castle, while the other barely survived the bitter cold. they both occupy the same physical place, so they are incompatible realities. as they begin to merge, the castle guy may start to feel more like the bitter cold reality. if he continues to feel good and doesn't experience that reality, his reality will win. the guy in the bitter cold will not survive. if he begins to feel the bitter cold, somehow their realities will begin to merge where they both find theirselves in a bitter cold reality with each other -- or maybe just the bitter cold guy survives because castle guy wasn't prepared for the bitter cold.

this whole thing seems to be a story of incompatible realities. I feel like that answered a lot of the reactions.

### 2021-09-26 16:53 - a bit more on incompatible realities

I had a weird morning of dreams, which I can't really remember now, but it seems that my explanation of hydrogen being organised mentally into a structure seemed to make a lot of sense to people.

there were some significant concerns that earth would no longer be compatible perceptively with us, and they would no longer be able to control or interact with us, given the incompatibilites between our realities.

there were also concerns that following the nova event, there would be a lot of places on earth that would have incompatible realities for them, preventing them from surviving.

---

well, that's not at all what I was getting at. I assumed that the martians would continue to transfer their consciousness into bodies that we produce, thereby continuing to perceive and interact with us. in that sense, they have to keep up with us. from their perspective, it looks like they're controlling and taking advantage of us, while reusing our perception for their own uses -- so, sorta like what's happening to me now.

I wrote that because it provided an explanation for so many things ranging from bases inside of mountains that can only be perceived when in an altered state of consciousness, the way that things can be materialised mentally, what's really happeing on gas giants, and potentially what is happening with the p-orbit planets interaction with our sun -- and how these different competing reality influences on the sun creates our solar storms and how that ties into LOA for us as a species on this planet through perception. as I feel more and more comfortable with the topics, I'll write about them. I still feel like I'm only perceiving the top of the iceburg there.

the other thing that I was assuming to be true is a bit messed up. just like me, I'm certain that there is a whole nother reality out there that I simply don't see. what I was implying is that our reality is liquid because any set of concepts could mean anything and a meaning can be implemented with any set of concepts[^1], and the martians would actually be collapsing that "wave function" for us, getting allowing us to perceive, not the real reality but the reality that they want us to perceive (exactly like me right now).

---

anyway, I went back to sleep and I woke up with this weird feeling, though it didn't feel bad, that they wanted to transfer my consciousness into jackson's body when he's born. I'm sorta OK with it. it would solve a lot of their problems because I think I'm responsible for quite a considerable amount of the the strengthening of the magnetic field here on earth.

when I was decribing the high frequency vibrating magnetic field as a product of emotions (which may be why we have magnetic field sensing gut bacteria), I began to notice that the aura that I have around me is what makes expanded vision possible. the few times that I got to see it, I was very surprised to notice that reality feels alive vibrating in a way which feels a lot like how I feel (they suppress the manifestation of how I really feel inside of my body). therefore, this high-frequency magnetic field is something that I am constantly emaniating.

the other thing I noticed just now is that although the sun is in b range for x-ray flux, the sun feels very hot outside like it normally does when there is a flare (yes I know TSI goes down during a flare; I'm talking about how prickly the sun feels). I also notice this happens when there is a geomagnetic storm too. therefore, it seems to me that the stingyness must be associated with magnetic fields, which is what I'm producing more and more of.

I am certain that the magnetic field was much stronger back before the younger dryas, but it's said that it was nice and people didn't need to wear clothes to be warm. following my discussion of incompatible realities, I think the reason for these cataclysmic events is because there are incompatible realities, and the sun is pushing reality creation to the extreme with the addition of many extra protons. that means that mental reality is created really quickly causing conflict between incompatible realities to accelerate.

well, this I believe is what is happening with the way that they're interfering with the electricity in my body is somehow (not sure yet) making the excessive heat. a conductor with a changing magnetic field creates heat (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7Rg0TcHQ4Y)). the other thing to look at is to see if destructive intereference produces a magnetic field. [a quick search](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-left-Constructive-interference-of-electric-fields-yields-destructive-interference-of_fig1_265849380) suggests that, "Destructive interference of electric fields yields constructive interference of magnetic fields and a virtual open." -- so maybe.. dunno.

what I mean is, it's actually these incompatible realities that produce this heat and the p-orbit planets (neptune, saturn, jupiter, pluto) all having incompatible realities are actually what is producing the heat on the sun. what I mean is, the temperature of the sun may actually directly correlate to how many incompatible realities are magnetically affecting the protons in the sun.

this is why I say that the girls thing likely will never happen until there is a physical or temporal separation between these incompatible realities.

"global warming" (and the heat damage on various megaliths) I postulate is the manifestation of incompatible realities (magnetic fields) interacting in an environment with a lot of protons floating around.

---

I don't really mind that they want to move my consciousness over to another body. it would buy them a lot of time if that decreases the magnetic field by a significant amount. however, it doesn't really make for much of a long-term solution though. for that, I am really beginning to believe that the only way to slow this down will actually be to make a spatial separation. that really is the best option that I can see, and it's the one that makes the most sense too. I also noted that moons seem to be designed to destructively interefere with the parent body to slow down their rotation rate, not to speed it up.

anyway.. a few more ideas

[1]: which is, btw the beginning of the "thrust" layer that I'm wanting to add as a precursor to desire.

### 2021-09-27 15:22 - thinking more on the transition

so, after I wrote yesterday's entry I went to watch stars and other things, and the reality is I don't at all feel bad about the idea of making my transition into jackson's body. there's a definite part of me that likes the idea of starting over again.

the way I see it, there are only 3 possible outcomes: none, some, or all. since they definitely don't want "all", and I didn't really have any resistance to "some" before going to becky's house, so if that were going to happen, it would have. I had decreased enough resistance that it could have happened the following day. though it didn't cause I think things were rearranged so they had a birthday party to attend to. the final option is "none" which I'm also fine with.

I actually prefer "all" or "none" rather than "some" mainly because my body is not operating very well. if it's all, then I have power over my appearance and my body so I can take on any shape I desire. if it's none, then I don't have to worry about all of the stress associated with trying to get my body to perform in a way it doesn't want to perform. in that sense, I'd rather just be born disabled and grow up never realising that my body isn't operating at full capability.

the other thing I like about none is that I'm starting to get the sense that "none" will be quite a lenthy thing. there is this part in the epic of gilgamesh that after gilgamesh puts on lion skins to mourn the death of his friend enkidu (this is referring to a cataclysm where east and west swap again so now we're in leo instead of aquarius), which is sort of the beginning of the 12 labours of heracles. he has to fight this hydra. the hydra has many heads, and each time he chops off the one of the heads, two grow back. this is like the story of job, when YHVH takes everything away from job, but because job was able to continue on, he got double in return.

this is sort of like the way I see myself with this. they'll have to keep transferring me into a new body over and over to try and keep their thing charade going, but each time I'll get better and better at remembering who I really am. sure, they may be able to cut off one of my heads now, but two more will grow back in place of the last. each time it'll get harder and harder for them to keep me away from my connection to that infinite knowledge.

I really don't have much of a difficulty with it because I'm noticing now that it doesn't really matter what my conditions are and what I'm taught, because I have an internal guidance system. in fact, I noticed that even if I'm fed bad ideas, lousy science, and all other matter of disengenuine ideas, that no matter what, I can figure out the way toward the ideas that feel good. I just desire to improve my understanding of the thing (rather than prove myself right) and stuff just starts to show up. from that perspective, there is no need to preserve knowledge because it's all there right now -- just, for whatever reason, I'm not tuned to it right now.

therefore, from that perspective, it's not about knowledge, it's about capacity to tune and reduction of resistance to the thing I want to know. none of the conditions matter, just my ability to feel the way I want to feel (that is, tune to it).

furthermore, considering that this game is optimising for error correction and recovery, I would imagine that each iteration they'll try and make sure I'm lead to believe a lot of bogus ideas. the better I get at seeing through the crap, the more and more resiliant I become. I'm actually certain that's kind of what is what I'm going to come out of this able to do.

I like to consider this transition the first trial run, which will then be optimised further, because as I mentioned, this will eventually become a game we are all playing -- the one where you're only fighting yourself -- your dual.

it's sorta annoying to have to start over, but I should get used to it, as it'll start to happen more and more. however, I am glad that in order to finally beat the game, I have to become completely unstoppable.

who knows, maybe when that happens, I'll figure out another way to delay it further... it seems that the more one delays the manifestation, the bigger and more impossible it is to resist. like I said, things go well, I'll find a way to go infinite...

---

there was one idea that popped into my head when I was waking up which came into mind which may add on pretty good to the disaster...

after making my transition to jackson's body, if girls seem to allow me to find my connection easily, they'll obviously determine that I cannot be around girls, and so therefore each iteration, they'll have to likely try and force me to be gay so I'll never associate with girls.

if I'm following my emotions, and the men don't feel good, I'll naturally gravitate away from them, meaning that in general I'll be away from people that don't feel good, regardless of gender. eventually, even good feeling men won't be allowed anymore, I'm sure, so I'll be back to figuring it out for myself again.

I think my capacity to go about things as an individual will reach a new height, meaning I'm basically imposible to control. this will likely cause another reversal (probably toward strong women), but that'll be perceived as unwanted again so another reversal. now they'll have to use the influence strong women have over me again and likely use me to find a way to produce their own "pandora" to influence me back into the group thinging again.

I'm certain that by then they'll *finally* figure out that they cannot fight against things. I think they'l probably try the next technique of dilution after that to try and get rid of me. you can't ever divide enough times to get to zero. then, the most tinyest part of me will be the most attractive thing ever.

they will have inadvertantly created a game which will produce as many sirius c types as wish to participate and lots and lots of beautiful stars along the way, too.

no big deal from my perspective. it looks like I had only been looking at the things as present, but they still need more things to line up for them to manifest.

### 2021-09-27 16:48 - going infinite

I thought I would properly define what I mean by going infinite.

whenver something manifests it has an amount of desired and undesired properties to it (relative to the perceiver).

undesired also contains desired, just with a different perception.

therefore, if we imagine a manifestation of mostly desired, there is equal amounts of undesired but most people perceive the desirable part.

likewise, a manifestation of mostly undesired aspects, there is an equal amount of desired, but most people perceive the undesired parts.

therefore, the most expansive manifestations have the most undesired, because they can be perceived as desired.

so, to keep accelerating, each manifestation needs to have maximum undesired and then find a way to perceive the undesired as desirable (see previous entry as an example).

---

the idea of going infinite is that the "big (desirable) manifestation" never happens. instead only incremental least desirable manifestations are allowed to occur.

the idea is that there needs to be created such a strong oppressive force capable of preventing the most desirable manifestation from ever happening. instead, from their perspective they have to continually allow things when they feel they have no other option than to allow it.

---

if this can be kept up forever, this is what I call "going infinite" and is what I intend to create.

### 2021-09-28 23:55 - twin towers

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZuK72eQGwA)

I have long been fascinated with the number 11, and I remember disliking that so many terrorist events had the number 11 asociated with them, most notably the 9-11 event. anyway, I decided I would continue to like the number even still.

as I was watching the video on the triptych symbols the many architects continued to use, I couldn't help but to notice a that the twin towers were a reference to the builders of solomon's temple.

the name, "world trade center" is giving the illusion that new york is the centre for all world trade -- perhaps a bit of a departure from the previously established london as the centre of the world and prime meridian.

the twin towers represent joakim and boaz which are a common theme of the two masculine and feminine sides in the physical, however when these two I's are united, the central (third) eye is enlightened.

---

I remembered a clip I saw a few weeks ago from a video linked on david mathisson's site...

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/M26-B44qQIs?t=69)

69 seconds into that clip, the reporter says:

> as you can see behind me the trade center appears to be still burning.
> we see these huge clouds of smoke and ash [...]
> a symbol of the financial prosperity of this city but completely disappeared now [...]
> presumably there were very few people in the salomon building when it collapsed

---

the "smoking gun" that 9-11 was an inside job was building 7 free-falling after having had no apparent damage. the reporter calls it the "salomon building" and states the symbolism just to be sure we know that we're talking about something symbolic... meanwhile the building she is claiming to have fallen is still standing up right behind her.

seeing that the previous financial centre of the world is london, and this is the bbc with the prefab news, this must paint a pretty good motive for british money to have motivated this event.

---

to further complicate the thing, it appears to have been pulled off by hollywood, complete with the massive fireball as the plane crashes into the building (planes don't explode like that). then, I also heard that the insurance for the building paid for the whole thing and the owner of the building cashed in on a heavily deteriorated buildings receiving much more from the insurance than the building could have sold for. so, the famous, "follow the money" feels pretty hopeless and murky to uncover anything substantial. the event is clearly symbolic.

that video talks about how the roman church decided in the 1700's to stop employing the freemasons to build their cathedrals. we also know that the roman church gave the "alhambra decree" that jews needed to convert to christianity or go away. they instead looked to make a new life in the americas (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0Kfp2-Lqh4)). sepehr makes the suggestion that the phonecians were essentially forced to move to the americas by the church and they brought their whole operation with them (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/9b7bbY9VGuM?t=507)).

a large number of the founding fathers were masons and knew of this esoteric teaching of opening the third eye with the balance of male and female. the world trade center must then be interpretted as a perversion of this ancient teaching and establishing an economic structure on top of this ancient teaching.

this has to be a symbolic thing. what keeps happening (remember LOA and what to expect), that this ancient phonecian culture keeps getting displaced, and a number of symbols regarding the "end times" are associated with empires which had displaced these "red ones".

so, sepehr doesn't ever really say it explicitly, but reading between the lines, it sounds to me like he's basically linking the cro magnon humans to the atlantians, which after the destruction of the atlantian empire, they became the phonecians. these are the "atlantian root race" that blavatski talks about, and also explains why there is such a coverup around everything mars, giants, and vibration technology related.

---

after the last few weeks I've begun to think that 9-11 *wasn't* an inside job. in fact, I think they're clueless about it. I remember one time when I was in la vera and someone really wanted to know what I thought of 9-11. I certainly said that I thought that I am certain that the buildings disappeared with tesla technology. I don't know if I said back then that I thought that no one died in the event -- but I do remember getting a lot of reactions on that for quite a while.

the other day at becky's house I mentioned in passing to a guy that I don't think they even know what happened either. I made the correlation to science, where they'd rather make something up than to say they don't know.

I don't think they knew, perhaps until just recently that it too, like the "ufo phenomenon" did not really understand that it was all LOA stuff.

---

imagine for a moment the following scenario:

a building which symbolises the financial super power of the phonecians in the americas falls down. the news telling of the collapse of the "salomon brothers building" appears to have been fabricated, so whoever did it controls the news and can get the reporter to say whatever they're told to say, regardless that the evidence of the untruth they're saying is in plain sight.

they notice numbers, so the sheer amount of 11s will certainly jump out, along with the buildings being symbolic of the two pillars, the anomalies almost certainly are stacking up. they find out that there are no fatalities in the entire incident. basically, they have no idea how an entire structure could disappear in such a spectacular fashion without anyone dying (from the incident itself).

it certainly appears like a terrorist attack, but they don't know what's going on. how could it be terrorists if no one died? how do they know no one died? how could something so catastrophic like that happen with just planning? it would appear that those responsible can edit timelines, but that's supposedly impossible. there's no way anyone would believe that a timeline editing group with capability, complete with governments news and media under their control would go to such lengths to frame them by making it appear like an inside job. no one would ever beilive that.

it really would sound weird telling people that it was a spectacular terrorist attack without any casualties, so in harmony with the bogus story about building 7, they have to now begin to make up news. they pay a whole bunch of actors to say that they had family die in the attack. everyone knew someone that died in the attack, so it creates the illusion that people must have died. I don't know if the people jumping out of the window was an added effect later or part of the original illusion, but it sure would put the stakes up pretty high to force them to make up other fatalities.

"wait, people will just believe manufactured news?" they said... so, instead of telling the whole world that they have no idea what happened, they sieze the opportunity to begin fabricating news stories to support their agenda. we need a memorial, lots of patriotism and to teach these terrorists who the real world power is.

---

this event ushers in the new era of just completely manufacturing news. I think they were doing it a little beforehand, but since people were falling for it so hard, I think this is when news started to become much more sensational, telling people what to think.

the 9-11 event so dramatically altered the course of history. it happened at a time when the internet was beginning to take off, and certainly the internet would have obsoleted many financial and communication control points.

from their perspective, it would have been a super great opportunity to regain control over things that they were losing their grip on. I think this was done on purpose.

they know what I'm talking about.

---

however much of an illusion is present on the surface, there is this sinister undertone of these different forces displacing the atlantians/phonecians/jews constantly removing them from their land or position of power. each time it happens, they (the martians) transform into a new form. this force seems to be difficult to identify where exactly it is coming from because I will argue that the force is a reflection of their perception.

these events and the ufo phenomena in general illustrates nothing more than than their own perception. things like there is this force out there trying to get them and tell them what to do, yet that is what they are attempting to do.

they wish to be an unseen force that manipulates and controls from up on high, and these sorts of events reveal only make them believe that they are also being manipulated from up on high by an invisible force that has an agenda for them.

reality will always reflect how you feel. so, like if you feel you need to manipulate and control people to not be the one manipulated and controlled, LOA will always find a way to ensure that you experience a reality that amplifies the feeling of being manipulated and controlled, and so therefore create a desire to manipulate and control, so as to not be manipulated and controlled.

obviously, at any time one can change what frequency they're tuned into, but there's nothing I can do to make anyone choose to tune into something desired. if you belive everyone is out to take advantage of you, LOA will ensure that feeling will continue to become more.

---

from my perspective, that feeling is benficial, because it creates a strong desire to create more and more technology, and I like creating things. if someone wants to rely on technology to create the conditions that they want, I can channel that desire into reality. 

there are other people that believe that people who desire to to control can control them, and again I have the same perspective. more excuses (desire manifest as fear) for me to make technology for them to be controlled by.

usually, those two types of people are swapping places endlessly.

or, they're the same person.

### 2021-09-29 17:33 - the golden rule is stupid

this afternoon when waking up, I was monologuing a bit. I grew up with this idea that I should treat other people like I want to be treated. if it wasn't that, I would treat them how I treat myself.

the major problem with treating people like I treat myself is that I'm very critical and hold myself to a very high standard. most people can't handle critisim and do not really have many goals or aspirations, and if they do, they seem to try and put in the minimal don't have high standards, willing to accept whatever they're given. so, I don't people like I treat myself.

the major problem I started to notice early on is that when I treat people like I want to be treated, again that causes huge problem. I *want* people give me their most well thought out answer when I ask a question -- so, that's what I do. I also want people to say they don't know if they don't know -- so, I do that too.

I found out that those sorts of answers are not what people wanted though. they wanted me to tell them what they wanted me to say (eg. what they want to hear). I have no idea what they want to hear. I was extremely bad at that for a long time, but then I used my ability to feel to my advantage.

if I take an idea, I can present it in my mind and feel its resonance with me. I also noticed that I can present an idea to another person (in my mind) and feel the resonance of that idea with that person. this allowed me to very easily get a sense of what they want to hear from me. I practised this a lot mostly drunk in spain, but I got pretty good at it.

---

getting good at telling people what they want to hear, I noticed is something very prevalent in spanish culture. I noticed everyone was running around with two competing narratives coming out of their mouth. the first was the image they were trying to present to people (I'm tough. I'm strong. I'm sensual. etc.) and also the narrative of telling the other person what they want to hear. sometimes these two narratives matched and sometimes they didn't.

there's this image that remains with me but I don't know where I saw it. it's of a really tough guy that is trying to tell a girl what she wants to hear, but it conflicts with his tough image. the other one is a guy that is also tough and stuff but he has te pretend like he's wounded to catch a break from the judge (just like in futbol). there are many other examples of this with kids and their moms or girlfriends.

it's a miserable place to try and constantly adjust what I have to say to fit what the person wants to hear. I recognise now that the pressure was even greater because I was being broadcasted without knowing it, which greatly sped up the process, but I really wanted to just say what I wanted to say, without having to try and lie or make something up to fit what they want to hear.

---

there is this other super big problem in spain (it may be quite prevalent in other mediterranean countries too, italy, turkey, greece, etc.) is that girls expect men to tell them what to do, but *only* when it's something they want to do. if it's not something they don't want to do, then men are punished for trying to coerce/manipulate them into doing something they don't want to do. don't get me wrong, it's sorta a reasonable reaction because dudes spend the majority of their time trying to figure out how to manipulate their words and image to influence others to their desire.

I don't want anything to do with this world. I don't want to tell anyone what to do. I enjoy collaboration, but the moment I start to have an agenda for someone other than myself, things go very wrong.

from what I can tell, I think this sort of behaviour is again an obvious reaction to thing. there must have been countless examples of girls going out, thinking a guy is super great, but her father or mother, maybe both don't think he's a good guy, so not only are they already looking for (and therefore attracting) the worst in her new boyfriend -- then when things fall apart, the parent is then proven to have razon. vindicated in their righeousness, they tell her never to follow her instinct and wait for someone (who appears knowledgeable) to allow her to do what she wants to do.

obviously, this falls apart on so many levels. even if she's able to figure out how to do what she wants, she still is batling the expectation (fear and belief) of her parents of the awfulness of the guy.

this isn't the case for everyone obviously, but I did find it very strange that in spain people need to be told to do the things they want to do. the church and patriarchical society in general may have played a huge role in that. this video makes that suggestion.

there's more I want to say, but for now good luck.

### 2021-09-30 01:02 - enki's trick (part one)

I woke up just now thinking about my previous entry. I realised that a possible trick had occurred and it was recorded in the legend as "pandora's box".

I'll explain the idea as if it's true. the video claims that there was a huge falling out between the gods, forming two factions -- those that wanted to control and ensure the inferiority of the human creation and those who wanted the humans to grow up to be an improvement on theirselves.

quick backstory: the idea is that the annunaki were stationed on mars, which has a different set of conditions than earth here. a lot of the things that the martians had, they brought to earth and these were the atlantians. this civilisation thrived and flourished, however as plato says, the gods lost a lot of their godlike capabilities, becoming more and more animal-like.

the atlantians thrived and flourished. the elite had knowledge of mental manipulation of energy, like fire and shapeshifting, and the energetic structures they built amplified energy higher and higher all the time producing a more and more incompatible reality.

the story of apep (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/TR5FrWiTzZo?t=364)), I think is a thinly veiled reference to the 12ky cataclysms. sometimes the dragon would catch the sun and sometimes it wouldn't. sometimes the thoth (set) would save the sun and sometimes not.

these periodic cataclysms must have happened on a pretty regular basis for the previous 100ky or so. I think the division that occurred between the two factions, and the resulting incompatible reality is the cause for these cataclysms. roughly speaking, think of it like enki wants to go right and enlil wants to go left. things continue to build up until there is a cataclysm and enlil wins.

I think enki keeps letting enlil win because it's not really a problem, considering that we're all eternal beings anyway. each time, a way is provided for some humans to survive.

---

we don't really know if enlil and enki have a common source. I suspect that they do, and are just two sides of the same coin: one creative and one destructive. humans are caught in the middle of this endless war, resulting that weak humans and humans that do not wish to know about their built in connection to source are constantly are culled. personally, consider this whole thing to be a giant eugenics program.

if you believe kuthumi's "extraterrestrial view on creation", and the bit about the channeled sirian triads, it would appear as if this malevalent force is something of a virus that is plaguing the universe since the beginning. I don't know how much I believe that. consider that we're dealing with some pretty good story tellers. the most likely is that is the easiest way to explain a genetic algorithm culling the weak before they're conscious enough to no longer perceive good and bad.

there is another brilliant feature to this kind of narrative, is that the malevalent characters eventually destroy theirselves, it's like the shell of the cosmic egg. the creature inside has to find its way out of the egg to gain the strength. the ones that cannot get out never make it out into the wild.

the self-destruction of the malevalent force is automatic because the creation will inevitably begin to realise its own capability, and to the controlling types, this appears very unwanted. as they continue to perceive unwanted, their reality will reflect more and more unwanted things will manifest. this will continue until their own perception of unwanted destroys themself.

---

back to the story: this battle of the two factions has a cost and that is perception of unwanted. each cataclysm must have been more and more spectacular. if things go altered, this next one will make the younger dryas look like childplay. over the last 100-1000ky this perception of unwanted must have manifested in many ways, with things stedily getting worse, but the most predominiate one was that mars continued to lose its atmosphere, thereby forcing enlil and his goons to earth.

after the younger dryas happened, there was a period where matriarchical society allowed humans to regain once again a lot of their capabilities. it's around this time that pandora's box was released on earth. it was likely a genetic upgrade for women that had some drastic changes on society and created a universal system, where perception was stored in the x-chromosome and that expanded perception was accomplished from the female bloodline. women became the method by which ordinary men could attain godlike capabilities and immortality (no radical change in perception upon death and the ability to easily "walk-in" to another body).

anyway, that all came to an abrupt somewhere at the end of the upper 5-8kya[^1][^2] when I think most of mars' were forced to relocate to earth.

this is where the stories of the dragons start. if you consider that the dragon is the reptilian god form (whether they had copper based blood or not, I dunno), but to me this is referring to the quality of perception. they operate from the "reptilian brain" the one that is instinctual. I am a very good example of a person that perceives through their reptile brain. I follow my instinct.

this form of perception is quite advantageous if you have a preception that feels good. your instinct will lead you naturally to more and more things similar to how you feel.

back when things felt good, this created a sort of universal bliss. it doesn't allow for much control over what is happening, so above the reptile is the mammalian brain. this is herd mentality. science says hunter/gatherer, but I believe that is a wrong image as I think that after the cataclysm, the earth did not produce nearly as abundantly as it did, so people learned to live with and follow the animals.

the matriarchical society provided the perception to be more at one with nature and the animals, which provided the food. that all came to an end with the arrival of the annunaki and their grains which is the foundation of society we live in today (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/yGN-pPBznpY)).

---

since the reptile instinct is driven by how one feels, it is imperative that one has a source of good feeling. consider that dragons are another name for the annunaki coming from mars and that it's a bloodline that offers easy access to that instinctual component of the brain. in order for that insinct to work properly, they need to feel good, and also have a propensity to use young girls as a means to feel good.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR5FrWiTzZo)

most people are herded like a bunch of mammals, and perceive life as a series of reactions to circumstance. they operate from the mamallian brain and are directed with social pressures and other social cues. the last thing they want is for people to begin to make their own decisions (neo cortex) or to get back to instinctual perception while at the same time feeling good. if you are insinctual, they want your instinct to be performed from a place of not feeling good.

---

ok, now on to the trick. I believe that the trick is a very simple one. make these dragons have an insatiable desire women, while at the same time make it so that sex with women increase the intensity of how one feels, while at the same time providing temporary physical pleasure. the physical pleasure eventually goes away and one feels stronger than they used to. when the physical pleasure goes away, they need more.

essentially, girls were the first addiction. they had to have it to maintain their draconic perception (draconic just means clear vision (TODO: find ref)).

what this eventually lead to is a reliance on the x-chromosome bloodline to cancel out the bad-feeling perception.

that's the back-story. I'll try and tackle how that relates to the amplification of feelings of control, and what I believe the next trick is, moving forward into x3 land.

### 2021-10-01 00:58 - lion man or aquarian man?

I'm going full free-form on this one. a lot of seemingly unrelated topics.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Ng6V6WWog)

this morning I woke up and I had this strange sense sort of repeat of one of a dream that I had a long time ago called, "adam and eve's dream". in it, most all of the major players had left earth. presumably, they went to mars and they were looking down on us and using us as a sort of breeding program. it felt to me like the earth had become a pretty energetic place and they didn't want to be here.

---

a bit ago I outlined a plan where I explained that the cataclysm was caused by incompatible realities, and that a split *must* occur, either spatially or temporally.

upon my discovery of the tychos solar system model, I also postulated the idea that mars could become earth's second moon. we would first join mars in its orbit then mars would begin to orbit the earth like the moon does. I don't have enough information to comment further on that one.

I also had another idea that earth could swap places with mars, and put mars where our moon is now and put the moon where earth is now -- the idea being that the moon would become our "child", much like the earth is to mars and the sun.

---

after watching the video with robert talking about heart/brain consciousness, I had some confusion because he talked about seeing the cow and bull symbols in the kings chamber with 5d eyes. 5d is when you perceive the thing from all angles all around it at once. like, imagine you were looking at all sides of the earth from the perspective of the ionosphere.

he must mean 4d eyes. I was watching another presentation with billy carson where he mentioned a few times that the image on his computer is clear and higher detail than the one on the projector (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/SYQUyMPY3S0?t=1129)). I think I know what is happening. it's the same thing and the reason why I can't see the bull and cow. they're likely using my form of perception. the way it works is the image just serves as a tuning device to get them to tune into that moment in time from that perspective. it's like remote viewing in real-time, and allows for much higher quality images because you're tuning into the moment itself rather than looking at the pixels.

if they developed that capacity further, they could tune into and look at anything they wanted to anywhere and anyplace in time. I obviously don't have that capability, but I just wanted to clarify that the ability to see more detail is a tuning to another space and time. if they were seeing in 5d, the whole entire structure would appear at once before them and they could see as many aspects of it that they wanted to look at, all at the same time.

while I'm on the subject, 5d is not just seeing yourself from outside of your body. it's seeing yourself from all of the angles that you want to see yourself at the same time. you can also look outside of your body in as many angles as you want, as well -- just like the sun does. in fact your consciousness can be anywhere inside of the solar system looking inwardly or outwardly at whatever directions you want. it's only you that defines the things (concepts) you're looking at and where they begin and end.

---

the next thing I noticed is that there were some references to special relativity and the speed of light encoded in the pyramid as well. I think I can explain this.

I believe the pyramid was a structure designed to transform vibrations in the earth and to keep the tilt and the rotation speed constant. I also believe that the rotation speed of earth is directly linked to the speed of light, because as the earth rotates faster, it'll change the transmission medium, and so light will travel faster the faster earth rotates. therefore, because I believe the pyramid is designed to keep the rotation speed as constant as possible, it also keeps the speed of light pretty constant.

in fact, it will keep it pretty close to those constants which the pyramids encode, because that's what it's designed to do.

I'm nearly 100% certain that the speed of light will be different on mars.

related to this, I keep having these weird knowledge pass through my brain that there are two types of waves: ones that the wavelength is determined by time, and the other is determined by space. if mars' atmosphere was constantly and the spin decreasing, you can imagine how big of a problem it would be to use traditional electricity on mars. so many things are tied to the speed of light.

therefore, because mars had a constantly slowing speed of light, nothing could be tuned properly. instead, they had to run on spatial waves, relying on the propagation speed of waves in certain density mediums. they must have become experts in this as there are tons of tuned rocks that have their density and spatial characteristics tunes to the desired frequency (scoop marks and stuff).

I'm pretty certain that the great pyramid was designed to keep temporal wavelength constant (eg. speed of light) with the spatial one (gemetry of the earth and its resonant frequency at this density).

---

in the entry where I discussed gas giant planets having a physical reality, but we simply don't perceive it because our perception isn't tuned to that reality, I got a number of reactions that were very concerned that they would no longer be able to perceive our reality as the density of this planet began to change.

I believe this is the case already for the insides of many mountain ranges and also the "argatha" centre of the earth sort of things.. this must be why the entrance can only be perceived by some and under only certain circumstances.

as such, because we're no longer held to this physical density, the earth will spin much faster, psychic interaction with physical objects and the perception of the astral plane will become the norm.

in that same video, he mentioned that we gained a new sort of vision in 2020. coincidentally, the earth also in 2020 began to rotate faster. I think this is related. the people who are at a higher vibration experienced this expanded visual capacity, while other people did not.

I know that the purposefully decrease the frequency of my perception quite considerably, and so that's likely the reason why I and many others did not experience this change in perception.

again, I believe this is related to the speed of light and our imaginations are literally coalescing hydrogen into a reality perceivable to those tuned into it.

---

the last thing I wanted to mention is the 4 quadrants of the zodiac. also in that video he maps dimensions of thought into the 4 quadrants (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/r5Ng6V6WWog?t=6618)). I thought that was interesting because when I look at that from the perspective of the spring equinox, I see something similar.

from the perspective that I've come up with, enkidu went nurtured and grown up in the 2d,art quadrant from aquarius to saggitarius.

I map these quadrants into a binary list of male and female polarities. in the order of that graph,

- 1d: 0,0
  - female nurtures female
  - scorpio -> virgo
- 2d: 0,1
  - female nurtures male (aquarian man)
  - aquarius -> saggitarius
- 3d: 1,1
  - male nurtures male (present)
  - taurus -> picsis
- 4d: 1,0
  - male nurtures female (lion man)
  - leo -> gemini

---

this video really made me confused about what's is the message here. if we're going to aquarius, then the plan is to cultivate a new aquarian man. I suppose that could be done from mars, however for that to happen, the speed of light idea and special relativity may need to be reevaluated, as I think a lot of the physics "laws" including the gravitation constant and speed of light will likely work differently on mars.

---

the "salvatore mundi" saviour of the world picture (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/r5Ng6V6WWog?t=3967)) was shown to encode the alpha and omega of leo.

also, the last supper painting has the "triptych" architecture in the back. robert points out it strange that leonardo (lion man) paints himself as peter (the stone) in the picture.

the weird thing is that in triptych has the male on the left (this is also true for egyptian tombs) and the female on the right. it's weird that "mary" is in the male position, and on the right side in the female position, there are two.

when looking for the last supper picture on google, I [found this](http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-paintings/last-supper-leonardo-davinci.htm), claming that the feminine one in the male position is john, jesus' most beloved. super duper no homo.

da vinci certainly knew of this triptych layout, and certainly placed that into the image on purpose. even more strange is that robert claims that peter (the stone) is holding a knife as if he's the betrayer, bet judas holds the bag presumably of silver.

why would da vinci (the lion man) paint himself into the position of peter (the stone)?

so, are we heading toward the aquarian man or the lion man?

### 2021-10-01 04:20 - lion man followup

I don't really know what it all means. I just know that there is something significant to him placing the triptych thing behind jesus. there must be a reason he wanted to go out of his way to denote male and female.

if I were da vinci and I were painting it, I would probably put peter in the male position, because the male dominated church was founded on peter. I would put john in the female position. so the fact that john looks very effeminate and is leaning at an angle of the pyramid, while in the male position *must* mean something. he wouldn't put the triptych if he didn't want to say something.

the pyramid is in the masculine place. however, obelisks (like the one in the vatacan) are the masculine symbol. obelisks (like the tesla coil) are designed to be the receivers of the energy. sin embargo, the chevrons above the decending passageway are looking pretty feminine to me -- just sayin...

---

the second thing to note is that da vinci is painting himself in as peter, the stone. in my studies when it comes to anything related to these people that come to bring in the next era, they never seem to get their desired reality to fully come to fruition. I believe that they *are* successful, however because not everyone wants to live their future, so it creates a split because of incompatible realities. each time there is a split, a stone is left behind. examples of this are einstein, peter, the great pyramid, etc.

to understand this, imagine that I am a perceiver of my reality, therefore everything is a reflection of my perception, so I will attract a future that I want. if a split happens because of an incompatible reality, it can only happen (from my perspective) because I sabotaged it. no one can create for me. therefore, in the reality that is incompatible with my perception, it must appear like I sabotaged it. that is the only way it could happen, otherwise.

so meanwhile, we're all on my timeline it will reflect my perception. nosebook can try to fight my perception for as much as they want, but eventually I will find my connection. this is certain. the only way that could not happen is if I personally sabotage it (in which case, I'll leave a stone behind).

---

what we have is an incompatible reality on multiple fronts. I want to do the mars thing, but that reality is incompatible with those wanting to keep secrets and hold on to einstein's relativity. it'll be hard to keep that charade going from the perspective of mars; very hard.

that means a split is coming up here soon and it's inevitable. what I am fairly certain will happen is that earth will begin to spin faster and faster and the magnetic field will continue to increase such that all emotion will be in super intensity. this is really good for a low density environment because you need that kind of density (focus) to hold reality together and maintain some semblance of persistence.

the speed will continue to increase until there is a split. we will continue on living in a world where things are a product of our perception, while it will appear as if I had sabotaged myself.

I suggested that one way to buy some time would be to transfer my consciousness into jackson. that would give a lot more time, however there are still a lot of problems.

---

the main problem is that me finding my alignment is an incompatible reality. if the earth's spin is increasing because of increased emotion, when I find my connection, it's really going to accelerate at a very fast rate until everyone incompatible with that speed will make their transition.

the solution that I proposed to that is to do a physical separation instead. if they're at mars, we can have a nice separation where we transform perception for the martians. our difference in feeling will ensure that we don't collide but continue to orbit each other. we utilise each others' energies for our purposes.

that's such a radical difference and obviously there are so many secrets that cannot be maintained if that's the case.

from a LOA perspective, this is the manifestation that you get what you desire, whether you want it or not. assume for a moment that the atlantians wanted to find a way to have the humans do the work for them to be able to keep their atmosphere working well and give them the conditions that they desire. they tried to do it by keeping us as slaves, but that fell apart. now, the manifestation of that desire is finally coming, however, instead of enjoying the journey to the manifestation of that desire with a steady stream of wanted, it has instead been only a stream of perceived unwanted.

your desires will always manifest eventually. you can try to keep yourself from them for as long as possible. however, they *will* manifest, and they'll manifest as a reflection of your perception. so for example, if you only perceive unwanted, then even the appearance of your desire will also be perceived as unwanted.

---

that said, I don't think we're doing the mars thing. it's probably ahead of it's time. we've got to get to leo first, it looks. then, fight the hydra, etc. remember, I'm the one sabotaging this. I get to decide what reality I experience.

from this perspective, I want to continue to use this time to further improve my capacity to feel the way I want to feel. whether this is the sabotage or not doesn't matter to me because eventually I'll put myself in an endless rebirth to accomplish that. I plan on playing my own game. the hydra must be fought.

you have to remember, that from my broader perspective, which I don't have -- I am also the opposition. from this perspective, I'm just kenny.

what I'm saying is, the martian timeline exists already. however, this is one that is guaranteed to be a split because all options appear to be incompatible realities.

### 2021-10-01 16:05 - so you want the aquarian man?

after a number of reactions, I think I figured out a solution. the nice thing is that it actually fits the storyline, too.

coincidentally, graham mentioned that ankor wat is 72(degrees) latitude west of the great pyramid. I went on to google maps and looked and sure enough it is. interestingly enough 72(degrees) increments are:
- mid-atlantic ridge (atlantis)
- ankor wat up through china up to near where tunguska event happened
- baja california up through utah up to canada
- some place in the pacific on the island chain toward hawaii
- giza / great pyramid

I see a pentagon.

since the 1900's the magnetic pole has been migrating from the top of the -113(degrees) longitude point in canada, and is now heading toward the ankor wat / tunguska point.

originally I thought maybe it moved in a star pattern, but now I don't know. I simply don't have enough information to say much further there.

however, what I believe the gizah complex was for is to fix the rotation speed of the earth by transforming earth energies stresses into higher frequency energies.

what I think happens when this magnetic pole shifts, it causes huge stresses on the earth which eventually results in an enormous fratture. the more stress that is there, the bigger the fracture. the most devastating of these stresses would be the last one in the mid-atlantic ridge.

if indeed when the magnetic field moves away from one of these vertical lines, it creates a huge fracture, then in this case california would completely fracture away from the coast.

I can't really figure out the order or their intervals. I tried to figure out the order but it doesn't seem to make ordered sense to me.

however, what does make sense to me is the idea that these energies can be transformed. I propose that once I'm connected, I'll be able to create pretty big things. my idea is to figure out how to make another pyramid or something else which takes earth energies and transforms them into a higher frequency (beneficial) energies.

I don't really know how exactly to do it, but I do know it can be done. my intuition says that some place along that line will do quite well to quell those stored energies. the idea would be to make a self-correcting system which fixes the rotation speed to a certain a certain speed, thereby fixing the speed of light.

---

this kinda fits in well with the stroryline of the hunchback of notre dame, where he releases the girl to apollo. hugo was very explicit about the story being about architecture and the the universal message that these structures encode in them. therefore, the structure "notre dame" which means, "our lady" is really the princess that quasimodo is releasing. the princess is just something to hang the story on. the princess is symbolic of architecture and the thing that the architecture encodes.

I know that robert's kid is named apollo. I'm sure they're very alike and I'm sure all of that is just a coincidence.

---

anyway, from my perspective, it looks like the tasks that remain are to continually get better and perceiving and tuning to the disired aspect of things. eventually, I'll find my connection and the creation of large-scale structures will be as simple as manifesting the way it feels. things need to be considered like what the desired speed of light will be, and things like that. I'll be able to translate the way he feels with all of those mathematical constants into a structure with relative ease. it's almost as if we've done this before...

anyway, I have no problem if the desire is to go toward aquarius. no problem from me.

it does rewrite the story a bit and make a lot more things much more convenient for them. the structure will create the perception matrix, not me, so it'll be fixed (never increasing in speed). it's probably also possible to make various layers as well, so like the masses get one frequency, the inner circle get another, and then only the priests able to enter the holy of holies get another.

sure, I'm down with that. I guess we'll work together sometime in the future to figure out those details.
