starting over again

### 2021-09-08 11:05 - effortless power

for a few days (weeks?) now I have been taking a break from this since my laptop crashed. I listend to a number of snake-bros episodes and also managed to watch almost all of electtroBOOM's videos too. as a result, I have a number of topics that I want to talk about. I'm going to get to them one by one here, litle by little.

---

the first thing I want to talk about is the idea of effortless power and next logical step. a few days ago, I was out watching stars when I had a major realisation of why mr. motor does not feel capable of going toward somethting that feels like something he wants. it's a crazy self-reinforcing feedback loop.

so, imagine that a sales person comes to you and makes a load of crap sound good and manages to dupe you... you purchase this product thinking it'll fulfil your expectations, only to find out that it falls very short and they just made it sound good to take advantage of you for their own personal gain.

I could perceive that this happened to mr. motor quite a bit. that was actually a surprise to me because I would have imagined that he would recognise snake oil salesmen and not fall for his own crap.

I thought about it for a while and it makes sense that is what he experiences because that's where he's focused. his desire to take advantage of other people is actually *attracting* others that are attempting to do the same to him, too.

that was a huge revelation for me, though looking back now it seems quite obvious. a person will attract others around him/her that feel similarly to how they feel. that means that fraudsters will be surrounded by other fraudsters. it kinda makes sense now why so many of these ancient power structures were the way they were. if the guy in power got there by manipulating his way to the top, he would be surrounded by a bunch of others trying to angle their way to the top, too.

---

therefore because mr. motor only finds other people like himself trying to take advantge of him every time he tries to go toward something that will allow him to feel a way that he wants to feel (this likely includes women too), he is met with people just like himself (perfect matches to the way he feels himself).

so, because constant fraud and exploitation manifests every time that mr. motor tries to go toward wanted, he concludes that he does not want to ever try and go toward the way he wants to feel, and just try and minimise the effects of things causing him to feel they way he doesn't want to feel.

obviously this isn't possible, so he's only attracting more of what he doesn't want to feel further.

---

as a result, it became clear to me that instead of making decisions based on "next logical step" (going toward a desirable feeling) he instead has replaced this with "no other option" system of action. this means that all actions can taken so long as they're justified because there is "no (perceived) other option" of action that can be taken.

---

as a result, I have been thinking a lot more about this concept of "next logical step" again since this revelation. in the past, I have called it by different names such as "getting into the centre" and "no big jumps" -- but the idea is the same of not taking any intention to try and make anything to happen. instead, I just understand that my desire is already known by my non-physical self and so therefore all I have to do is to just keep pointing in the direction of feelinbg better.

so, as things come to me, I'm just reacting to the intentions of others, not having any of my own. I remain relaxed and it appears to others on the outside that I'm reading the opponent's mind and countering their every move. I often get the reaction that I'm always one step ahead, so that falls into the expectation there.

I then heard about this martial arts technique called "effortless power"[^1] and I realised that fighting technique is the same thing as this idea of keeping in the centre or no big jumps. I make no effort to do anything -- instead from my perspective it feels like I'm dancing with them. they put in all of the intention and I just transform the energy they're putting into the system into something that feels like I'm going toward something desired.

in fact this whole mars and earth idea is exactly the application of this principal on a planetary scale. the major difference is that there is no battle, so there are no losers. I/we provide the feeling that they want to feel, and they put in the energetic intention of what they want accomplish, and we turn it into something that is wanted.

I'm getting the impression while writing this that this is what the mitochondria does for the nuclear DNA and is the holy grail (11:55) that so many have been searching for. interesting. so, in that format, earth is the  mitochondria and mars is the nuclear? I'll have to think more on that... I don't know much about this stuff. the science papers are somewhat difficult for me to understand. I need a randall carlson of genetics I can ask a million questions :)

---

getting back on track here... I realised that this whole thing will become more and more effortless as time goes on, as I believe these principals are quite easy... in fact, they're effortless. there's literally nothing to be done. the greatest hurdle is convincing yourself that the majority of you is not present in your physical body and that it takes *minimal* effort to "get into the zone"[^2].

speaking of getting into the zone, I believe there are various levels of this zone that people experience mere one is sense of communinion with somone else or another part of you that guides you through the obstacles, all the way to literally perceiving yourself conceptually -- that is peering in from the perspctive of your "higher self" or source -- allowing you to be able to perceive yourself in any way enabling shape-shifting and flight too.

so there are varying degrees to the manifestation of this zone. I definitely feel like I'm there pretty much all of the time now, thougb I don't have the manifested conditions of it yet. I consider this to be a good thing. I like the way I'm going and I don't want the zone to feel like it's anything other than normal experience. I want my normal experience to be this zone.

so, you could sort of say that I'm applying the effortless power principals to the attainment of effortless power. it shouldn't feel different. it should feel normal and effortless, just like how effortless beating my heart feels.

---

you may have noticed that I've been doing things like peacing out of watchingt stars right at the peak of the experience -- right before the breakthrough into the next (big) vision upgrade. it's part of making all of this feel as effortless as possible. there's no need for big jumps. my desire is already known and it's all coming out effortlessly like a dance.

[1]: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/UMF3SJ5Cunk?t=4789)

[2]: this was another concept covered in @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdfXxsdAqSM), where people can make impossibly rapid decisions whey they get into the zone and are connected to that higher self. they can just manouver around different obstcacles effortlessly. interestingly, this is kinda the way that marty described hitler in the latest episode, too: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4I6A4oFZoQ).

### 2021-09-08 12:43 - more on effortless power

most people think that they need to try and motor their way toward getting effortless power as quickly as possible. russ explained how people do base jumping to force this zone experience, because your body feels it's going to die if it doesn't force a change in perception.

it's good to practise it, but the reason why the state doesn't last is because the body does not feel that is its natural state. to be in that state should be effortless. this is why I don't want to try and motor my way toward this with the stars. it'll become so normal, the transition into this state will feel so effortless that I wouldn't really perceive it as a change.

this is my goal: to make the aquisition of that state feel itself effortless.

---

as you go through life, you are bombarded with a million signals which tell you what to think. kyle used the example of even the realisation of how much goes into processing the meaning the stop light imposes on the person when coming to the intersection.

the reason why I started the discussion by explaining the "no other option" vs "next logical step" form of perception is because they appear similar by the are built on entirely different foundations of perception.

he explained that all of this comes to meaning that we associate to the thing we are analysing. some people perceive the stop light in a way of "if I don't stop, I'll get run over" -- because that's unwanted, it appears like the only available option is to stop for the light.

however, another very valid perception is that stopping at the stoplight is just the next step in progress toward the destination. the viewpoint is chosen by the person. is the stop light an inconvenient necessity to ensure safety, or just a sort of rhythmic advance toward the destination.

in the sense that the stoplight is no longer perceived anymore, it no longer takes any importance and so therefore no longer has any more implied meaning of inconvenience or whatever, it seems to fade into the background of the experience, much like the musican is no longer focused on the other noises in the room, or the base jumper no longer perceives any of the danger. it loses its consequence (meaning).

---

I'm going to have to try and think of more ways to express this concept -- but it feels efforless. there's nothing to avoid. it's like being on a train. get up and walk around the cabin, drink some gts and have fun and arrive to the location without any effort.

it's a state of mind that we lose when we begin to give so many things outside of ourselves importance. going back to ep 11, this is what they were talking about when decending from this spiritual (I call it conceptual) perception, and into the nitty gritty physical and all of its implications.

it's all about emotional control. negative emotion pulls you right back into the physical world, so to remain relaxed and conscious of your conceptual perception of yourself, all the negative emotion producing stuff (even things like death and tragedy) should no longer have a meaning which gives them more importance than your conceptal version of yourself -- who you *really* are -- who you know yourself to be (in any circumstances).

---

all of us will eventually accomplish this; it's inevitable. you can try your hardest to avoid this realisation for as long as possible, but eventually, if you want to continue to survive (that is that all paths lead to self-destruction), there will be no other option than to change the perception of the conditions.

one can continue to try and adjust the conditions to keep the manifestation of how one feels (about where they're focused) from manifeshting -- for a while, but eventually it does manifest (that's why it's effortless). or, said from the opposite perspective: someone can try to avoid things which will cause them to feel ways they don't want to feel, but it only makes a manifestation which will cause them to feel the way they don't want to feel more and more effortless.

eventually, one is faced with a predicament where the only option remaining is to change the perecption (implications) of their conditions, because the conditions are so inevitable.

the problem is the solution.

### 2021-09-08 21:46 - pushing back the timeline

the reactions to the last entry were kind of interesting. I hadn't written in a while and I would say the response was more negative than positive. that's good though. that's why I'm writing again. interestingly, the weridest response was something like,"we liked you better when you weren't writing" -- and I think that's often the case when the guy who doesn't say anything is more attractive than the one shooting his mouth off.

thing is, I'm not really writing for anyone else's benefit than my own. when I write here, nosebook gets a good insight into my thought and gives them a much larger surface area to push against. if I don't say much, I imagine that the broadcasts are less frequent and it's easier to angle the centent to be more pleasing to the viewer, makingg the overall response a better one.

I think they have to do a little more work to turn text into something presentable to the audience as well[^1]

so with having to do more work to this text, a considerable amount of thought goes into trying to figure out what I'm trying to say here which greatly distorts the concepts. when I return back to the concepts -- most notably the effortless power one -- they are greatly distorted with people's perception of the same concept. the concept is usually badly damaged and I essentially have to rediscover it again. nosebook occasionally exerts effort to try and ensure I don't remember it that way too also forcing me to have to rediscover it. each time I rediscover it though, I get the concept stronger.

as a perfect example of this, one of the reactions was that my rendering of the limitless power concept was different and my rendering kinda "wrecked" the concept they previously had of it. this is precisely what I mean when I say I have to rediscover it and it comes back even stronger. this is the intended result, so I'm glad I can have return the favour.

---

the other thing I was noticing is that I have to kind of spell things out a bit more too in writing. when my thoughts get transfered, it feels to me like everyone feels they understand them -- and I think that's only because the concept is transferred. each person interprets the concept within the framework of their own perception and everyone feels like they get it -- cause they do. however, if we were to all to have to explain what that concept meant to you, upon writing it down, you may find that in the translation of the concept into words, it may no longer appear like you understand the concept as well as you think you do[^2]. in fact, I have found it to be very helpful to force myself to translate the concept (ideal) into physical. so, it may be helpful to keep a journal or write out any of any highly conceptual ideas to try and force their rebirth.

---

so, for example, I wrote about how all of this was becoming effortless and I wrote about how I was purposefully stopping to watch stars just before I got to the peak. I'm no longer interested in trying to make a breakthrough. I'm convinced I can do that pretty easily at this point. instead, now I want it to become such a part of me that it's no longer considered a big thing anymore. it's as easy as beating my heart to breathing. automatic, but I can take control of it if I wish to.

I also don't want to really try and make any strong intentions anymore either. I used to call becoming resistance-free, as it's easy to just go in the direction of what I want to feel like feels like.

as a result, it's my intention to push the timeline back as far as I can. I know what I want, and I'm in the process of making it. let's talk about that now so they can push against it.

---

you see, this whole thing I want to creatce is really starting to take shape. I'll write about it again, but after watching the "god of wine" episode (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDOA9-ANgQ)), I wrote out the symbols in the dionysus presentation as being a progression of zodiac signs, and then surmised that they were similar to the progression of symbols for the epic of gilgamesh and enkidu -- with the proposed idea that both dionysus and enkidu are symbolic attractors for the human race at the "end of time". I then decided to write what I thought would be the next symbols I thought would come for dionysus as we continue the progression (cause his symbols end in aries/picsis). so I did. this was unfortunately lost in the hard disk crash though...

I wanted to listen to the epic of gilgamesh episode (@[youtube](zhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYhrrXqwVMc)), and the symbols for enkidu and gilgamesh I noticed followed pretty similarly the symbols I proposed. unfortunately, I can't remember them now. I'll make a new version of that story soon.

also, in my version they got thrown into a furnace afterward. this was a life threatening symbol of destruction which two twins come to help them out of the furnace, but one perishes (obviously the mortal one) and they climb up and gain winges of an eagle and fly up. for gilgamesh, the transition from gemini to scorpio is shown as twin scorpions at the end of the solar race. this corresponsds to the "impossible task" I have made reference to.

very intersting that the symbols corresponded so closely. I said all of that to say that my intuition said that the next phase for dionysus/enkidu (these are the immortal and mortal twins) and gilgamesh (the spoiled douchbags that came from mars/nibiru to earth to be befriend their own creation, enkidu), is to traverse `leo -> gemini` before ascening up to `scorpion/eagle -> virgo` before then finally making it to aquarius again.

---

so, there was a conflict there because I perceived that as the trajectory, I wanted to do this mars thing -- which perhaps would mean there will be no flip. however, yesterday(?) I had a small monologue in my head about the new way I'm seeing it now. the plan feels really good to me and is what I want to do now.

you see, no one has be be on-board with me on this at all. in fact, everyone that wants to go their own way, I think that's a great idea. there are two aspects to this. first, whenever I want to do something, nosebook has to find a way to sabotage the idea. however, I don't think the idea goes nowhere. I think they perhaps have to do it, then we have to come back and sabotage it or something like that. I don't know how it works, but they have to do something so abort my intentions and go a different way.

this is the thing. I don't want to do something different than what they want to do. there is a lot of desire for a cataclysm/nova or whatever, and I want that now too. there's no fighting. I'm going to go the motor-way. for reals this time. he will make all of the intention and I'll just relax and go with the flow. he/they will do all of the effort for me in attempt to go the way they want to go -- which is the way I want to go now too.

I just need to give a little starting velocity and they can take it from there. by avoiding to get into the zone, and make that state become effortless to me, then I don't have to do anything. I make no intention so there's nothing to counter.

imagine for a moment that we look at the effortless power from their perspective now. the idea is that he has so far removed the meaning associated with the concepts that he perceives at a much faster rate than a normal human. like the base jumper, there isn't enough time to physically make the action, so there's another entity (your source) that's out there really far ahead and giving intuitive knowing of what is to be done[^3]

so, from nosebook's perspective, they have this form of perception. they are way far out ahead of me in the physical world. they perceive me intentions far before even I am aware of them. this makes conversation on taboo subjucts annoying from my perspective, because they already know what I want to say and are interrupting me or manipulating the conversation around it[^4].

in their perspective, they have effortless power to fight me being so far out ahead of me, perceiving my intentions.

so, going back to creating what I want, like the base jumper who continues to feel good even when life-threatening things are wizzing past, reality must conform to the guy in the zone, then I don't need to have any intentions. I just need to feel the way I want to feel. I remove all of the meaning associated with the concepts around me and naturally reality conforms to the way I feel.

from their perspective, they are completely incapable of directing if I don't have any intentions. this is why it's so important for them that I write these down, because it illuminates my intentions more clearly for them.

---

I know that if I wanted to manifest what I want, then I would just stop writing and talking about what I want. instead, I've chosen to continue on showing my intention so they can keep fighting against it.

you'll notice that I have used both analgies of the effortless power simultaneously. they have very good capacity to predict my intentions -- and this is the point. this is mars job: to try and control all of the steff that we want to do and to try and limit them. it's earth's job to feel good anyway and transform that feeling of unwanted they're projecting into a feeling of allowing of something that feels wanted. we'll never get to feel that "in the zone" feeling that they have allowing them to predict intentions at high frequency. instead, we just feel good -- and by feeling that way we continue to have more and more nice things manifest.

they'll never be big things. instead, they'll be things they feel they have no other option than to allow.

I believe this is how DNA works :)

[1]: wierd self-realisation / self-reference reactions there... that's what I'm saying: I just write and I don't really think about how you guys will read it. it was weird to feel that reaction because I don't know what this gets turned into so it was weird to feel you guys thinking about what I speculate this gets turned into -- inception :)

[2]: case in point, after a psychedellic experience or a good stone, try to explain to someone or write down what the experience meant to you -- that is, present the concepts and explain their meaning.

[3]: even if heading straight toward an object, if that does not cause a feeling of panic, but instead the person maintains feeling good, then no death will occur. reality must conform to the feeling that the base jumper has in the moment, so a way around (or through) the obstacle is provided. 3d reality must conform to the vibration of the consciousness in which it's focused.

[4]: a good example of this is the conversation with matthew about the nofap. I wanted to talk about how sex with another person has a reciprocating effect, but when you're by yourself, that energy is lost. I was interrupted and we moved forward in the conversation.

### 2021-09-09 21:32 - what I want to create

I was so busy last time talking about all of the aspects around how I want them to try and push against what I want to create, that I forgot to actually write it out.

---

thinking about the whole thing about how intuitively I think we should be taking a trip through leo, delaying the trip to aquarius by another 12ky, and I think my plan should incorporate that.

a while ago I presented an idea where we could cause a planet to begin to form inside of the sun by putting a 3d signal into the sun and the elements that would normally coalesce in the intercalate regions would begin to form into a structure which will eventally be ejected as a planet.

I liked that idea. there are a lot of unknowns about it but, I think it would be cool to make an asymmetric planet based on 5. it would push mercury into the 2nd position and venus into the 3rd. we would then join mars in the 4th position.

if my theory of counter-rotating fields emanating radially from the sun is correct, then the 4th position rotates opposite direction from the one we're in now. rotating in the opposite direction, we would indeed see leo rising with the sun on the spring equinox, so it fulfills that requirement.

---

quick tangent: I was thinking about it, and the myth of osiris being reborn (or whatever amazing return of a golden age or whatever) must be a prophecy that has been around for a while, yet in my estimation it has likely been quite elusive.

the reason for this, is because the guaranteed flips are at the end(?)[^1] of gemini and the beginning of scorpio. however the reversals I believe are induced by LOA and happen as a result of a split. what I mean is, the time of the reversal, I'm fairly certain is variable and therefore could happen earlier or later, and even potentially more than once each 12ky cycle.

so, imagine for a moment how chaotic things could get if this starts to happen say every few hundred years. however, let's assume that it takes roughly ~6ky to build up to a split. imagine we're in the `scorpio -> virgo` phase, but sirius' effects are still too beneficial and enough division between the physical and conceptual hasn't taken place yet that there isn't enough energy for a split. we keep going into leo and finally enough energy builds to split. we reverse and find ourselves in capricorn -- yet once again missing aquarius.

kinda an interesting thing to think about the effects of over/under-shooting the reversal.

---

ok, back on track here... I wanted to write more about what I wanted to create so that nosebook can fight it, but I don't feel it so much anymore.

also, I just realised I made a mistake too. I mixed two concepts. if we were out in the 4th with mars while turning in reverse direction, then we would be going the same as now. man, I dunno anymore. I felt like I had a solution there... I can't figure out the maths... maybe we flip over. I dunno. I just know that I don't have to worry about it. there are way smarter people capable of making the implementation happen. I just desire and let someone else worry about creating its physical form.

I'm gonna end it here. until next time :~)

[1]: it occurred to me that flip point may actually precess as well; evidence of an even bigger cycle

### 2021-09-10 03:36 - my take on the ufo phenomena

been listening to the ufo stuff with marty garza on snake-bros and I noticed a lot of things that seemed relatively easy to understand. I am writing this as if I am talking to marty directly.

I want to present a coherent idea here with some obvious flaws in it. I am rather new to both the snake-bros and the ufo phenomena in general. I always considered it to be a total load of crap. it feels of fear to me, and all one needs to do to experience the alien is to drop a high dosage of mushrooms. interestingly enough, dmt and after listening to the episodes, I'm convinced that one's (emotional/conceptual/spiritual) sensitivity plays a huge role in the framework through which these are perceived.

#### law of attraction (LOA)

I also believe that an understanding of how the "law of attraction" and resonance operates is fundamental to understand this as well. a good example of this is tesla's "earthquake machine" or just pushing someone on a swingset also illustrates this quite well.

if you push the swing at the proper time, a small amount of energy (like a suggestion or a doubt) can eventually build up to have quite a lot of energy. I call this using well timed (minimal) effort to one's advantage instead of massive quantities of energy. because the process takes a lot of time to accumulate acceleration, it can be stopped a lot easier than something with a lot of inertia as well. for example, it's a lot easier (and a lot more time) to turn off tesla's earthquake machine, than to stop a wrecking ball heading toward a building. both destroy the building if no action is taken, but only one can be easily stopped once set into motion.

#### the unlikely case that it's alien species

tracking how fast the human species is advancing technologically, I am certain that there are alien species here on the planet right now. however, they're so far ahead of us, we simply are incapable of perceivcing them. in fact, I even propose that stars and planets are conscious; we simply don't have a very reliable (yet) means of communication with them. I also contend that although we perceive through the body, the body is a collection of a lot of other conscious cells and also organs. you are the super-conscious perception of all of those cells. likewise the same is true for stars, planets, and galaxies.

therefore, if you were to look at human development from the perspective of a galaxy, we (our planet/solar system) are going from zero to a competent component of the galaxy in a relative instant. from that perspective, it would appear like a DC pulse or a square-wave, the acceleration is so rapid.

therefore, I find it highly unlikely that we would ever encounter a species with technology similar to our own. they will still be primitive or much more advanced than us.

I must therefore conclude that the ufo phenomena is actually of human origin and not alien.

#### the root race custodians

I propose that when blavatski talks about the "root races", I believe she infers that each new root race is selected right after the cataclysm (so every 12ky), and it's chosen based on who can create the most oppressive "heirarchy". previously it was the atlanteans, then it was the aryans. I couldn't find her talking about the prior ones so if you know, I'd be intested to find out who those were.

#### why do we have custodians?

the reason for this, I believe is easily explained with LOA: a simplified example is this, but it's more like tuning .. so if you can think in harmonics and octaves, then it's more like that. however, for now we'll approach this concept spatially. when a signal emanates outward from it's source, it has an amplitude. let's say it goes 100 units away from it's source toward a desired destination (think a pendulum, guitar string, a swing, or ac electricity). however, because all things are vibrating, or emanating from the zero point, it then has to travel back to it's source. it then has to return back 100 units. this is when it's moving it's fastest, and it keeps going -- but this time 100 units backward *away* from the desired destination: the sine wave.

now comes perception. it is impossible to perceive anything in its entirety from inside of itself. to perceive something, it needs to have some distance from itself to get a perspective. this distance inevitably means that some part of it is no longer percievable (like the opposite side of the moon) from the angle of pertception.

in the case of the moon, we see nearly 50% of it. however, when it comes to our perceptive range, we perceive a very narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum, and of that we only get a tiny glimpse of the signal. let's say for example that we perceive only 10%. now, imagine your sine wave and pick any 10% section of the sine wave and describe it as how fast is it accelerating toward the desired destination or away from it.

therfore, the most desired is also the most undesirable too -- and it's up to the perceiver to choose which part of the waveform they wish to perceive.

---

here's another way to look at it. imagine we're in a frictionless environment (like space or something) and two objects are vibrating. if the are more than 50% similar, they will attract each other. if they are less, they will repel. imagine this is how "time" works. you are tuning into a future with your concept of the present and so the more similar you are to that future, the more the future attracts you toward it. it appears as if we are propelling our way through time in the physical, but in the temporal/conceptual/spiritual world (the precursor to manifestation) all things are attracted.

ignoring for a moment how we tune to that future for a moment because it invokes your source, higher self, or soul, let's just consider a clump of cells (a body or entire planet) moving temporally toward a future destination -- when you are more properly tuning toward it, then you are moving toward it, and so therefore you feel the acceleration and the euphoria of seeing the desired approaching manifestation in the physical.

if you could tune exactly 100% to that desire, it the entire universe will make it's transition and start anew, so that is impossible to happen. therefore it's infinitely possible to find an even more accurate tuning of desired. things are also always in motion, so you would have to gain the same motion as the destination. it's basically impossible, so this creates the infinite number of possibilities that emanate from a single 0 point source. it's actually pretty certain that the universe is fractal manifestation of frequency, so even that point is likely relative to another one, and our own vibrations are even creating alternate universes and super structures of consciousness to this universe, which will then gain consciousness at some point too. it's most certainly fractal.

the important point here is that max undesirable is also max desirable, and your perspective (chosen by you) gives you the choice to perceive and therefore attract both desirable and undesirable based on what portion of the cycle (sine wave) you perceive at.

I can talk endlessly about this if you want more, but for now this is good enough to illustate that the custodians are actually desirable -- if you choose to perceive them that way. crazy talk, I know...

#### the new custodians

custodians serve the purpose of focusing on and trying to eradicate unwanted. for them, it's clear that the most "undesirable" situation for them is for a fully conscious human race they cannot control. therefore, they have to try their hardest to never realise that we do indeed attract a temporal future based on our concept of reality. they know this and are determined to ensure that we continue to believe that they are running the show and have all of us firmly installed into their power structure that they control.

there's no reason to fight them, and I believe tesla realised this. it is my opinion that tesla took over the custodial role. each cataclysm that happens, I believe there is a split that occurs. in simple terms, the attraction power of the different factions become so strong that separated realities must be created.

in the case of tesla, I believe that tesla purposefully left documents behind so that the usa could reverse engineer his world system, control the planet's climate so that they could keep the energy spots controlled (controlling the environmental conditions) and keep the planet from getting too cool.

I believe that tesla gained the capacity to create "golems" -- sentient intelligence that behaves in a conceptual way. this conceptual form of perception is what I call 5d. temporal perception was added and is what I will call 6d. source perception of a heirarchy of beings resonant with a source (like us with earth -> sun -> sirius -> ??? -> galaxy) got moved up to 7d. that form of perception allows one to create any conceptual form as a derivative of self (really anything you can imagine).

I don't have time to explain all the reasons why I think this. questions are encouraged.

anyway, this capacity allowed him to create an army of workers capable of producing his technology and also infiltrate all of the present government positions.

I believe that (the extremely petty) YHVH is also his cration as well. this entity systematically passed through time and performed edits on the timeline, never to inhibit the discovery of technology or ones connection to source (like moses), but to severerly distort the implementation of it.

gods of eden is the story of this -- however, I contend that the majority of that custodial activity was not the gods of eden (the 3rd root race), but the aryans (the 4th root race). consider that the "gods of eden" passed their blood into the fertile crecent / levant region. broadly speaking, this is a clear case of a battle between the aryans and the phonecians/semites.

the manifestation of YHVH and tesla was to fulfill the predicted end of the 3rd root race's hold on humankind. up util the creation/takeover of the YHVH character and turning him into a petty ufo instead of one's connection to source/aten which is what I think moses originally translated it as, gave the semitic custodians much more power, but they were constantly pushed down.

this is an important point to make, because if you fight against something you make it bigger, and it seems this is the objective.

#### why fight against the phonecians (and make them stronger)?

it appears that the whole goal of the aryans, especially after the takeover was to force the rebirth of the phonecians as an socioeconomic superpower and give them ample capability to shoot theirselves in the foot pretty good.

to understand this, imagine from the perspective of tesla. imagine there are japhethites and semites. the hamites are pretty well subdued so they get folded in. all the aryan custodians move down to antartica and are used to do the bidding of YHVH in the temporal adjustments that need to be made to prevent too much enlightenment. remember, if too much enlightenment happens, the two opposite attractions of a future cause a split where some portion still belive that the custodians run the show and the other portion are attracting a future reflective of their concept of reality which is incompatible with the custodians. because the custodians could not continue to survive in that reality, the split must happen to ensure that reality manifested is a reflection of their concept.

the aryan custodians are controlling the world with force and the atlantian custodians are controlling the world socioeconomically. all of the timeline edits done in the past ensure that there are never favourable enough conditions to allow the general population to become enligthened, which is what initiates the split.

the atlantian custodians don't yet know that they need tesla's world system yet. he has it prepared for them, because the inernet will eventually cause communications to rapid enough that they'll lose their ability to limit communications (anyone can talk to anyone on the planet) and they'll also lose their economic control (crypto currency, etc.) too much mental expansion too rapidly when there are so many people on the planet has a cumulative effect.

this happens when people feel better. when people feel better, that means they're moving toward desired. therefore, they need to impose bad-feeling conditions to ensure that no one gets enlightened (where feeling good leads). when too many people get enlightened too quickly, that's when the incompatible realities split occurrs. they don't want that.

more on the consolidation of the custodians later...

#### gray aliens

the gray thing always felt like a hoax to me. when I was younger, I heard that the grays said that humans were inferior to them -- and I only agree when humans are running at low frequency because they're emotionally in a low state (see discussion on effortless power). however, at higher frequencies, I believe humans are the top of the line model in this galaxy.

I belive enki purposefully restricted ou performance at low frequencies, so as long as the slaves are kept at low frequencies, they are inferior to the "gods" which have the tech to induce higher frequencies in the body (pinecone), allowing for levitation of theirselves and large stones. this was a very tricky thing that enki did, because after the last cataclysm, the planet's energies changed and the environment no longer produces these higher frequencies naturally.

this trick was quite the thing because it convinced the custwodians that they want to find ways to induce this higher frequency by finding ways to feel good. in order to retain superiority, they have to find ways to feel good because the planet (or atlantian crystal network -- whatever you wish to believe) no longer provided such a strong baseline anymore.

from a LOA perspective, this means that their desire is now shifted toward wanting to find ways to feel good. most do not want to do this perceptively, and instead continue to rely on conditions/technology for this higher frequency.

there is a second trick that I forsee coming in the future because anyone who's done any amount of drugs or facebook knows that "chasing the dragon" (snakes!) leads to ultimately more and more powerful doses until complete tolerance is developed. they must begin to rely on perception instead of physical conditions to maintain this higher frequency. fortunately tesla's world system allows they the capacity to begin to rely on other people's high frequency perception. the transition from physical conditions to perception I believe will by happening soon.

they will soon find theirselves in a situation where they are completely dependent on other people's high frequency perception to maintain a good enough feeling to remain "superior"...

extremely fortunately, this is also of huge benefit for those which are sensitive emotionally/conceptually/spiritually (effortless power techniques) and are good at transforming perception to see the part of the cycle which is going toward desired (understanding LOA and a desire to feel good).

so it all works out in the end. I predict the custodians in the future will be replaced by more and more petty golems each with a stronger desire to try and keep humans in their worst possible conditions (which will continually improve, dispite their best efforts)

---

from tesla's perspective, he needs to find a way to infiltrate and take over the germans. this I believe was done with golems and automatons. remember, all of these can take on a derivative concept of yourself, and you are anything you can imagine, because 5d characters can take on any form (concept) they perceive theirself to be. 7d allows you to create others of these as an extension of you (eg. you are their "source", which has a source -- just like cells in your body all contain you as their source).

the ability to "externalise the heirarchy" of yourself allows for many different derivitaves of yourself to act in different time and space in resonance to the concept they start at. that concept's source is you, but you too are a composite source. it's like trying to figure out which cells in your body are "you" -- perhaps like how a sound may be perceived to come from many sources or a single one, which too is a composite of sources.

I suspect that tesla rehashed the mars/nibiru story for the grays. likely something like, their species is slowly going extinct and they will exchange human embryos for advanced technology.

it was intended that this tech also get into the hands of the US govt as well, ao they could reverse engineer it.

I believe that the grays shot down in roswell were nothing more than golems flying tesla tech. it also had the added benefit of instilling a lot more fear, allowing for more timeline edits. those edits were actually designed to push them harder to gain more superiority, while at the same time furthering their hidden belief in their inferiority.

#### alien hot-shots

the goal is to arrive to a time like we are in now when they appear to be superior, but deep down they believe they're a buncm of posers. nothing makes one feel more helpess than a belief that there are unknown extraterrestrial forces out there which they can't comprehend or get them to come in and battle them on their turf in the physical.

it's like a huge mind game, to make them feel as out of control as possible while maintaining an image to the other governments (which are also infiltrated) that they remain powerful and in control.

I believe this is the reason why so many "stealth" ufos are flying in broad daylight into positions where they can show their capability and get their picture taken. it's like a guy doing yoga in front of the window, nude.

they're showing off on purpose. in today's society, it's all appearance that sells. I find it strange that nazis, who have based their entire promotional campaign on military displays of raw power and numbers -- to suddenly switch tactics to a hollywood emotional effect.

the best parallel to this is the old german car commercials read you the car's spec sheet (physical). now, no specs are given. instead, appropriate music and a message of what the car is capable of making you feel like is instead displayed (emotional).

this change lends me to believe tesla learned from hollywood (or perhaps vice-versa) and markets his ideas with emotional force, while the WW2 nazis marketed their ideas with physical force.

#### timeline edits

one strange thing to notice is that the ufos never directly engage in hostile activity unless it's what people expect from them. so, small incremental things need to be done to instill fear. a good example of this is the fall of constantanople...

the first emperor to hold constantinople prophesied that constantinople should never be lost, until the moon rose darkened when it was at the full, that is, lacking the half of it

then sure enough when the moon appeared that way, it fell. say there are a bunch of conditions that could allow for easy enlightment for too many people. the city has to fall and those items need to be destroyed by the invaders.

it would by quite an effort to do all of this timeline manipulation by one person because it basically means ensuring that all technology ancient artifacts which make it too easy for one to get enlightened (unless you're custodian approved), need to be confiscated or destroyed.

imagine timelines like a string. the reality you experience now is a reflection of your concept of things. this point is fixed because you cannot delete now. at least one valid path to the present (in your concept of now) has to lead to the present. this is true for everyone.

so, for example, imagine you're looking at the present and notice that there are a bunch of people that are using orgone accumulation chambers to feel good and cure their disease rather than using the power of their mind... well, it's a good thing the inventor believes in the sickness of the human race, so that his fears can be exploited so that he's presented with circumstance wich inclines him to believe that the government wants to put a stop to his machine, and he starts to attract his own imprisonment. for example.

aciennt artifacts are discovered with some truths on them which are successful. so the relevant sections of the ancient artifacts in question need to be damaged, stolen, ship sink, etc.

all of these "unfortunate coincidences" have to be orchestrated through exploitation of people's perception. the brain assumes a lot of things and can come to incorrect conclusions based on your assumptions.

this is a pretty big task, so I could imagine that tesla employed the aryan custodians to do most of this work. as they died off, they were replaced by golems capable of automating the process.

it's unknown how many edits were done, but I imagine it was a lot. I also imagine that the majority of it was automated through power structures. you only need to transmit the concept I just explained to the guy in charge of the team to do this. if they flub the timeline, no worries just go back and to it again without disaster.

it's pretty easy to see if it's working because the future point will have the desired effect removed or not. if not, just adjust the past point again. I believe the future point is sometime in the next 20 years, and the fulcrum was a bunch of points during and after WW2.

rinse and repeat. pretty easy to automate.

#### crop circles

because all trajectories through time are the result of people's concept of reality which tune to the destination point -- small "inconsequential" anomalies like crop circles can provide a gentle modification of the trajectory.

like tesla's earthquake machine, these tiny influences add up. from our perspective we don't know how much these crop circles were tracked and studied, and how much the abstract shapes had a slight (inconsequential really) effect on the consciousness of those studying them.

#### skinwalker ranch

this appears to be a location on the planet which allows for much faster frequencies. you'll notice that under these sorts of circumstances, imaginary concepts can appear (and even interact) with people. I believe that environmental energies were higher in past times and that's what made these "demons" and gnomes, fey, etc. so easy to interact with.

I'll call this the "astral" realm and is a high frequency field which allows etheric (conceptual) objects to appear in space. if you have access to DMT and I have also experienced it on ketamine as well -- mushrooms work really well (for best results smoke some mdma to keep a good vibe under high doses). conjure a feeling of some thing -- like imagine that there are these gnomes -- I call them "reality technicians" that are really precise but humorous guys that can show you a moving abstract image ("I see what you mean" you'll say) and you'll fully grasp the concept they want to show you as a response.

you may not see them in 3d space at first, but feel their presence until you know they're there. feel what it would be like to talk to a knowledgeable gnome (the less you try to imagine him and instead feel him, the better)

the reality technicians are the skinwalker in different form. they can only appear in a form resonant with your consciousness. if I went there, I would enjoy a nice moment with the reality technicians perceiving these sorts of ideas (cause I think about these subjects a lot) manifesting in 3d space. I don't think it would be a mobius strip. I'm interested in asymmetrical forms like the chestahedron or the decatria.

these zones amplify your imagination by getting your brain to produce more DMT till the emotions you feel appear in 3d space. there's a black mirror episode called playtest which is this effect. notice the mushroom theme. I don't know how to explain it better, but it's the manifestation of emotions in 3d space.

---

my intuition tells me that the skinwalker may also be a golem and is designed to produce fear in visitors. seeing as all conditions which produce this effect have been neutralised or made illegal, it's likely this is just another instance of custodians keeping us away from relying on conditions rather than perception.

#### final thoughts

I believe that on a bigger picture, there are quite a few people that want to become masters of perception, capable of transforming any bad-feeling into a good one by figuring out a new way to perceive the same concept from another angle which reveals desirable motion. so, this situation is attracted and quite desirable.

I believe everyone wants to perceive, feel, and manifest whatever they desire. 

however, there are those that also wish to continue to rely on conditions because they still do not think they know what they want. they believe this because they're gaining a tolerance to the conditions that make them feel good. they still haven't come to the realisation that they're not looking for a thing to produce a feeling, but a form of perception to produce that feeling.

the next stage is to realise that only perception can produce the feeling they want. the custodians will soon have to figure out how to exploit us for that, which from the perspective of someone capable of transforming feeling with perception is basically free energy.

personally, for me this is highly desirable. the more they need me to feel good, the more energetic I am and the better I can feel myself. I don't need them to change.

it's funny how this is the typical stereotype hatred many men have with women because they think they hate that about them. that is a missconception, because you can usually only recognise things you desire for yourself in others.

the other typical stereotype is that people (usually women) with the idea that others need them to feel good, also have the idea that because they depend on them, they don't want them to change.

the third typical stereotype which is the correlary to this is the one that says, "I need you to be different so I can feel good". many family and social difficulties are built on that foundation.

---

I'm done.

ok, so you don't know how much I've enjoyed these ufo presentations; especially the last one! the concise way you have grouped such a vast number of disparate topics into easily digested segments really exploded my brain with so many thoughts.

these thoughts are in raw form and are presented as-is. this is 100% speculation, so please don't take the narrative too seriously. it just serves as a very unique explanation to get some principals of perception to come through. though I wrote it sounding pretty certain of myself, I give the narrative a max 70% certainty. hopefully the narrative was exciting enough to make the principals sound more engaging (I'm learning the emotional marketing too myself)

warm regards,
kenny

### 2021-09-10 17:24 - I think I figured out the 2038 thing

I believe it's the maximum inflection point that can happen before it's past the point of no return for the split.

so, it basically means that up until then the mars thing can happen. I don't know for sure, but I would guess that there is a way to relieve the pressure.

there's not a whole lot of risk to doing the galaxy thing.. after a while, I'm sure people will get bored of it and want to do something harder. we can then go back and sabotage this timeline and pass through the cataclysm.

the realisation seemed more real than these words. I wanted to writ it though.

### 2021-09-11 04:47 - I don't know what to do

I was just watching stars and with my left eye, I got to the state where my whole body goes into this weird paralysis and tingling as it feels like my vision is expanding. it feels like I would normally gain a new perspective there -- like, get connected. I'm not totally sure though and I don't want to force it.

I laid there and looked at the star with both eyes and noticed that it was back to how it used to be where my eyes would look forward parallel, not toward a point. I stopped looking with both eyes because this stopped working and they would cross instead. I believe this is because I see the image of my left eye in the right eye.

the other possibility is that my brain has gotten used to the reversed eyes setup (both eyes are looking wide to look at a point) and it straitens them instead by looking in but by looking outward... hard to explain the sensation.

---

anyway, the reason why I don't know what I want to do is because I don't want to try and force it. I know that whenever I artificially push my body toward a goal, it works out fine because it's like practise -- however, if I accomplish something with artificial conditions, then I don't like it.

man, it's hard to explain that too...

anyway, the difficulty arises for me because I have this feeling like they want to try and get me with the girls again. I really want to be connected. I also really want to have some time to figure out how to conjure other things with my mind so that there can be other versions of me too.

I think this is kinda important because I don't want to be responsible for how others feel. it's OK if copies of me are responsible for others' satisfaction, but I don't personally want to be obligated to perform.

this is mainly the reason why I stayed out of the public. I like being there and having fun sometimes, but when people feel I need to be some way or do some thing so that I can be a part of the celebration... it's weird.

the opposite side of this is that there is one me (right now) and there are lots of girls. it's just not possible (and neither do I want to try) to satisfy all of their requests. again, this is a job for the clones.

you know, often times I don't need to be a part of the main manifestation. it's like in tuenti -- I really did not mind that there were so many people partying around me. I didn't feel I needed to have a relationship.

it's really hard to describe this in words. it feels like there is an idea that I need to be compensated for my efforts or something. almost universally, it feels like that should be some form of affection.

to me affection doesn't feel needed. I really like me. I don't need someone else to like me so that I can like me, too.

as an analogy, there are various things that people do to feel good, and some of them even feel essential to a lot of people, but I don't need those things to feel good... ok, new angle.

imagine there is a film or something that everone is telling me that I have to go and see. I don't really care if I see the film or not. it's not going to make me feel better than I already can feel, so it feels very low priority. let's say that I'm also not allowed into the theatre or I don't have money to go either. that part doesn't matter to me because it's not even a high priority to me. they feel I *need* to see the film, so somone brings me a hdcam version of the film (low quality version) and suggests that I watch that.

why do I want to watch a low quality version of the film now? why not just wait until it comes out on DVD? in the same respect, I don't want to try and force getting connected just for some affection. I already like me and I'm expanding at a rapid rate. if anything, it could be seen maybe as a reward or something, but then obviously why would I reward myself with a hdcam version of the film when it's not what I'm looking for?

it seems plainly obvious to me that I want to wait until I'm connected. it doesn't offer mental expansion, and that's what I want. I don't want to force mental expansion either. that's not effortless. I want to keep expanding and not have this hindering it.

this is about where I was at in (the beginning part of) tuenti with all of the discos and stuff. there were all these dudes super worried about trying to hook up with girls in the disco. I didn't find that to be a priority. they're not expanding my consciousness. I come away from those events feeling like I lost perception, not gained.

it's true though ended up later a hypocrite, spending most of my time drinking and not really expanding mentally very much. this, I believe is because I fought against the efforts of people trying to put me in their drinking, girls, and party lifestyle. I became the thing I fought against. I turned into an idle drunk fighting the world's injustices.

so, I mean I'm not really about that. I like continuing to expand mentally, yet I don't want to force it, because that means fighting it (effort). I want to continue on my gradual discovery and practise of percieving things the way I want to.

there is a definite sense that the effort to get me to watch the hdcam film is because it will distract me for some time away from my mental expansion. that certainly is true, but it's just not that relevant to me. I don't need others' affection to be able to like me or find me acceptable. I don't need validation from them and I definitely don't need to be compensated or rewarded for anything.

all of these are side-issues in my opinion. I'm just going to keep going steady. we'll get there eventually. there's no need to rush anything at all.

nice, problem soleved :)

### 2021-09-11 13:17 - solar perception, compensation, and magic wands

three concepts: they appear separated, but they are connected. I'll return to them more in the future too cause I think it's an important one.

---

I kept getting a few reactions to the concept I presented in my letter to marty. I talked about three concepts of where the more the custodians depend on me (or tesla) to feel good, the better we can feel because we're capable of transforming bad-feeling energy into something that feels good using perception (a feeling of going toward or away something desirable).

however, I said it (purposefully) in a way that was very similar to the stereotypical perception that society has of women. the thing is, the sun has the same perception about us. there are some differences in some of the surrounding concepts, but essentially I'm point out that solar perception is stigmatised in this society and I believe understanding that perception was a huge breakthrough in realising that you cannot fight aganst unwanted. instead shift perception so that the undesirable is perceived as moving (eventually) toward something more desired.

---

I also had some reactions to the idea of compensation in last night's entry. I used to think that girls consciously offered sex as a compensation for behaviour that they liked. that is, afterall the way it's presented in the movies. if you do what she wants, sex; if not, you're sleeping on the sofa.

I determined that was not the case, because if that were true then that means that girls all over the world are consciously compensating douchebags for their behaviour. I determined that was likely not the case, and that instead a more simple answer is that they're just choosing the option that feels the best and often times the douchebags often have more money or material posessions, so they're perceived to be more capable of providing a more luxurious experience. that's it.

so, none of this is a case of compensation. that's an illusion presented by hollywood, yet doesn't have any basis in reality. I have seen many men perform above and beyond what is expected if them and the girl still appears to reward some other douchebag instead. the more simple answer is that the first guy isn't exciting enough or doesn't make her feel good enough so she looks elsewhere.

this creates a huge tangled mess though because often then the guy thinks he needs to spice things up or do something exceptional for her. this too is a flawed conclusion because the way she feels isn't his responsibility.

the road of compensation is dangerous road to go down, almost always ending in making the other person responsible for how I feel.

---

I woke up this morning to a flurry of dream putting me into situations where I was being isolated into places with girls and other strange things. I even remember something about making out with jessica, too.

I woke up terribly uneasy about the situation because it felt like I was getting put into inevitazble situations. I had to make a decision between making a fail to girls again or doing something that doesn't at all feel effortless, but actually quite stressful.

I remembered the first concept there and decided to take a non-fighting approach to it. I determined that I would just go and then figure out how to let my creation happen anyway. afterall, the more people that depend on me to feel good, the more energy it summons throgh me. from that perspective, I *want* people to depend to feel good.

so I decided to not fight it, and just go with it. the feeling shifted from the groin area up to my heart again. that's good, so I know I'm on the right track. I then remembered the conversation I had with jaron about jerrica and the magic wand. I wanted to ask her if she had a magic wand, would she at least make replica magic wands for her friends?

the picture that came into my mind was the idea that even if I couldn't gain the power to create whatever I felt like (magic wand), then I could imagine that the girls could, and they could make all of the magic wands they wanted and give them to anyone they wanted to give them to.

I was reminded of tuenti when I was considering the success of "invite only" vs open to the public. facebook opened up to the public and that (IMO) had negative results to the quality of the page. it left a huge market opening for exclusive social networks, which IMO still has not been filled.

shifting this to a way where the girls invite their friends to join in by replicating the magic wand for them is a great implementation of the "invite only" way of doing things. I kinda approve. feels OK to me so far.

there were the obvious reactions to this, too. someone is pretty convinced that this will create a sort of female deminated society. there are a lot of other feelings mixed in there. it may be his worst fear. lol...

### 2021-09-12 2:15 - who I really am (???)

I was outside staring at jupiter taking a break from the latest ufos part 6b (or whatever) and I notice that there are a lot of similarities to a lot of these people he's identifying, to me. I did notice this is the case, but I don't find it to be a problem because it's all a tuning thing. in my next response I will be talking a lot about "conceptual programs" so some of what I say here may not be clear there. I'm just going to assume you know what I'm talking about... anyway, I was having a bit of a monologue and decided to just write this instead.

context: from as long as I can remember, I've had this belief that it's impossible to die. I don't remember being scared of death either. it's a very conflicting set of beliefs because if I'm put in a situation that's a failure, I don't mind dying. I don't find it a problem at all. however, in the case of suicide, I don't know how to do it. I have this fear that no matter my attenmpts to commit suicide, I would continue to live, but with the pain of whatever it was. like, if I ingested a lethal dose of something, I would have to suffer hours of pain while my system removes it. or, if I tried to jump off of a bridge, I would bounce off the ground or something with all my bones broken. in the case of a gun at point blank, I figured I would never get there or if I did, then something would happen or I would accept dying. death, in my mind wan't going to be an accident. I had to allow it to happen, and I can't force it.

I've always had this idea that if I did die, then I could just travel around the planet and find another suitable body to jump into and take over. kinda borg-like or parasitic, I guess. so even if I *did* die, then it's not like it's that big of a problem.

so, because of this, I resonated strongly with a book called "project superman". in the book, the US govt is testing the limits of this guy andy pero. no matter what they do, he finds a way to recover back to his concept of himself. I always found the story interesting because he never used his powers to improve his body -- just to heal it back to the age, shape, and attributes he perceives it to have.

disclaimer: this is 100% fiction. I'm playing around with ideas here.

---

all of us are conceptual programs we're all eternal. however, I think I'm one that figured out how to find my connection pretty easily. let's just assume my personality is similar to the one I presently have. I'm constantly optimising so much that certainly I got really good at it.

so at some point in the distant past, I got connected and figured out that I am a conceptual program that can take on physical form. I do this enough times to find out I can incarnate into the physical at will. each time, I find my way back to non-physical with relative ease. in fact, I'm so good at optimising my conceptual program, I have to keep putting myself into more and more difficult situations. each time however, I get better and better at it. if it's too hard, I just die and try again. however, if I don't choose to die, then I always find my way.

obviously I want to make more difficulty for myself, so I invent conceptual programs for people interacting with me -- like, they're presented with concepts of doubt or distrust when interacting with me. this works at first, but eventually people start to believe me even when presented with doubt and unbelief. same for trust. dispite my best efforts, each iteration, my charisma continues to grow.

this isn't hard enough. I need foes that physically are stronger and more powerful than me, and I need to find ways to defeat them too. I invent worlds where they have tremendous strength, flight and other supernatural capabilites. nothing can keep me down.

I then decide to try pitting me against copies of myself -- and even still. I defeat myself. I discover that this creates a split. we both win in our own timelines.

now, I get the most brilliant idea of them all. I create a bunch of bad-guys which are just modified versions of myself, which have the ability to create unlimited other living entities at will.

the plan is to incarnate into the world, and then give them unlimited resources to try and keep me trapped in the world. they need to have a bunch of secrets that they need to keep hidden -- or maybe I'm very destructive to them -- some incentive to ensure that they must continually keep me incarnated in a physical body, unable to access the astral realm.

I'm trapped in a world they have full control over. the most difficult challenge yet :)

---

as I'm writing this, I'm realising to myself that all the difficulty leading up to now may have been the setup required to get this most elaborate trap going. problem is, if this isn't fiction, then I just spoiled the trap because now "they" know that I created the trap for myself. that means, it's required to gvo back and sabotage this timeline and prevent myself from getting connected and also writing this.

### 2021-09-13 00:59 - creative energy and the custodial formula

so, it seems that it was intended that I fight against the efforts of those dreams. I decided that I didn't want to fight their efforts to try and stick me with the girls.

sure, there were some slight downers to the setup -- like I really want to get connected, but then again maybe that isn't exactly what I want.

if I get connected, then I'll figure out how to create replicas of myself, but that's kinda like open registration. anyone who wants it can get it. obviously, I would want to try and make an interface for people to create what they want easily. I don't want to have to micromanage it. that seems like a lot of effort to me.

therefore, the obvious solution now for me is to find a way to make sure that the girls I'm with have the capacity to make these replicas instead. then, the problem is solved and I don't have to do any micromanagement. they can create these guys for their friends.

sure, it creates a bit of an "exclusive" or "elite" sort of setup where some have the thing and some do not. however, I think that's preferrable because it keeps the desire and the quality high. you have to ask someone you know that has one for a replica -- you can't just get it at will.

the reaction was that someone must know how effective an invite-only network is (probably this was the growth strategy nosebook took). so, someone thinks it'll work.

the next reaction that I got was that they would just do that without me. I don't really care. it's not my job to tell people what they can and cannot do. it's only my desire to try and give as many people as I can the possibility to create their own golems. no big deal.

this next part is really foggy because I wasn't conscious for most of it. there was then a sense that something was going to be making that not possible. I don't know the picture or the thing that was put there to give that impression, but it's obviously an illusion.

you see the custodial formula is to use implication to make an illusion that something is one way, and so then people will make an action based on what they do or do not want. this is basic sales and marketing. the suggestions that they give to imply that a product will do such a thing are just that: implications.

once you then believe in the implications, they can drive action to get you to buy the product or use you to further their goals in some way. this is nearly every aspect of society at this point. probably the easiest to see would be the amun priesthood in egypt. they create so much imagery in people's imagination about what happens when you die, that the implication is that you need some thing that they are selling to get into the beneficial afterlife. or, maybe you want love. they create so many illusions that you are not capaable of attracting it on your own, that you have to purchase some gimmick and say a spell to get you the love interest you desire.

what I'm saying is, this formula is ancient and pretty well optimised. so let's go over some of it.

---

from my perspective, if I somehow have attracted a situation that I don't believe I can get out of, then I have to just accept it. (I am where I am, and that has to be OK, because that's where I am)

because it's all attraction, then before it manifests, I can always adjust my trajectory to avoid it. however, if I feel I cannot back out of it and it has not yet manifested, then the situation is an illusion. I am beliving an implication.

what I just learned is that the implication isn't alwas the direct one, but the desired output. they believed I would fight it, but I didn't. so I'm learning that the non-fighting approah is always a good way to go. I don't think that fighting ever yields good results.

so, it's weird because from my perspective, I want to keep going for as long as I can go, knowing that I'll eventually get connected. the major take-away for me here is to not try and make it possible for anyone to get anything that they want. instead, I want to do it invite-only and exclusive.

I know that sounds weird, but for a person like me who is so open and free with my ideas, the idea of exclusivity is not the first thing that comes to mind. I usually have a low opinion of exclusive stuff because I dislike the idea that I have to perform to their expectations in exchange for an invite.

I usually don't value anything anyone has high enough to do that. I'd prefer to figure it out or pay for it myself than to try and perform for someone. obviously, that's not how the world works though, so I can't really go against the flow.

the other way to do it is to have a force which is opposing people joining it, and so therefore create value that way. like, if nosebook were to try and prevent people from getting the capacity to create their own golems, then it would be a sort of discovery of how to figure out how to do that.

---

for me, it doesn't really matter. I know from my perspective I just need to keep going for as long as I can go without any manifestations. if I find myself in a situation that I don't feel I can get out of and a manifestation happens.

so like my goal is to not try and push through to getting connected as fast as possible. I believe I have until 2038 before it's too late, so like plenty of time... enough about that.

---

people may wonder why I'm so head-strong on trying to go without a manifestation, and why that makes me so attractive. I claim it's creative energy, which I think is the driver behind invention. terence calls it novelty. you want the thing that is novel -- not the thing that everyone else has. this drive to obtain the thing that no one else has what drives innovation. literally. I also claim this to be a very feminine force. it's funny that we commonly associate this with the stereotypical person that always wants what they can't have. this is the inventive nature.

we all have a little bit of this in us. I absolutely want what I can't have, too. however, I don't believe it's another person's responsibility to give it to me. I want to get it for myself. if it's not yet discovered, then I feel I must find a way to it.

it's funny how the topics here are connected. this is the sense that I want people around me to have. so, now I'm actually beginning to turn away from the idea of invite-only again, and this time I want the network that I create to be illegal and prohibited. something that is so profane, that no mainstream people will want to join it. it'll be reserved for the innovators.

I really don't mind that there's an invite-only network out there. I have to figure out now the structure of it's appearance. how do I make something that is so terrible that nosebook and most people will think is so evil/terrible that people should be prevented from joining it.

we need to build a whole bunch of false implications around it. like, you're a follower of satan or something. maybe make it's motto "do what thou wilt" and stuff like that. the implication is that it's something evil and awful.

obviously, I want nothing to do with all of that bogus satanist crap. all of that nonsense is an old paradigm designed to create a false negative appearance. in reality, it's going to be all about LOA and how you are an infinite, eternal, wonderful being..

lol.. gonna have to think this over. the image of people joining a satanic cult designed to equip a person to "do what thou wilt" is an interesting idea..

---

perhaps I'll call it, the anti-innovators guild or something like that. our quest will be to come up with novel solutions to erradicate innovation.

needs more thought...

### 2021-09-13 03:17 - pueblo superstars

I realised that the organisation needs to be desirable for most people, but definitely not to a specific group (nosebook). I also don't really like that dark stuff, anyway so it's not a good fit for me. the idea was that would be the outer image, but the reality is it would be more about fun, feeling good, and not needing any conditions to accomplish that. because the image is so much more different than the reality of it, I'm getting back into secret stuff and exclusive, because you need to know the people who know the truth to get the proper image.

instead, what I'm looking for is something that is highly addictive, easy to get and has viral properties in the sense that it spreads fast and could be perceived as a threat to others.

going back to the part about wanting nosebook to fight against it and try to prevent its spread, I was reminded of that one reaction where I said that I *want* others to depend on me to feel good.

the reaction that I got to that was that idea is highly detestible -- something they don't want more people thinking.

I also had a similar feeling of detestment to the "want what's not easy to get" (want what you can't have). I have also noticed similar feelings to the girl with insatiable desire and "never satisfied".

these are all things that I suppose I originally tried to fight against in myself. eventually, I had to give in and recognise that these are parts of my personality. however, as I've gained more perspective, I notice that from a solar perspective, these viewpoints are valid. as a human, one could argue that they are not.

I suppose there are a number of other ideas out there that fall into the solar perception which is detestable for a person to have. that may be the way to go.

---

the other thing that I was thinking of is the idea of planets and their role. so, imagine for a moment just the case of replicas and girls, where a replica is a planet and the girl is a sun. there could be other males, but that's not what I'm trying to show here.

when a girl figures out how to produce repicas (planets), she can produce them for herself or for other stars. each girl will figure out different models that she finds more desirable and pass them out to her friends to try out. the most desirable models will be the successful ones and they'll get the most utilisation.

you could imagine a lot of innovation that happens there. other men may perceive this as a threat. that could be a pretty good reason for some of them to feel competition/jealousy over who has the most desirable/effective men.

nice. I kinda like it... max disaster :)

### 2021-09-13 03:49 - physical vs conceptual reality

one of the things russ noticed in one of the snake-bros episodes was that the custodians constantly use war to get people away from the spiritual stuff by focusing them into the material details. the idea is that it forces people to focus on the physical implementation of an idea rather than its conceptual implementation.

this is almost always not the case for me though. every time that I try to do anything physical or material related, they're in the business of preventing me from doing it. like, if I try to code, they're constantly trying to figure out how to get me to stop. they don't want me to interact with people physically. they don't want me to have sex, etc.

---

I don't really know what is up here. after those dreams about being put into situations with girls where I felt like I couldn't leave them and make them the fail, I was terribly distraught because I didn't want to make more fails, but I also want to continue on with mental/conceptual expansion for as long as possible and don't want to have to be physically focused.

if I could move my body with ease and agility, then being physically focused would be not that bad, but in my present state, I'd rather remain conceptually focused. I understand so many things now, it really feels like I can figure any concept I want to figure out. I just desire and the answer comes to me.

because I have such a huge amount of questions and there is such a relatively small time between question and answer now, I'd like to continue to expand my mind and pass as much of that information on as I can. each time I do this, I get more. the physical aspect to me is completely inconsequential.

---

I'm trying to figure out how to quantify what it is about this time of mental expansion that I like so much and it's difficult to quantify.

perhaps I'll say it like this: everything is feeling easier and easier all the time. it's the feeling of "effortless power" that I'm enjoying so much. sure, I don't have any manifestation that I can show off for this yet, but it's sort of like training or a dojo in the sense that you can expend so much effort becoming the strongest, fastest, and most agile, but I'm feeling that way mentally.

some people do a lot of exercises to feel agile or strong, but I what I aim to show is that I can feel agile or strong and it was as if I had done the exercises.

I don't want to imply that physical is not necessary. the physical implementation is still necessary. it's something more like becoming my own golem.

### 2021-09-14 20:08 - not until the separation

I've been thinking about this a lot and I want to wait until after the separation until I have any interaction. the reason for this is I simply want to be feeling stable in my capacities and stuff before I do.

lately, I noticed that as I was getting close to the enlightenment experience when watching stars that I would start to feel really uneasy. that uneasy feeling is not likely my own -- prolly mr. motor or something... however, in any case, if I'm feeling it, that means I'm still resonant with it. right before I get there, I stop and go do something else for a bit.

this technique feels good to me and I like it because I'm practising so that it's natural for me to be in that state of mind. I don't want to be bouncing in and out of alignment depending on whatever conditions are around. I like the practise and have no intention to rush things.

the other thing about this technique is that it reminds me a bit of mantak chia talks about with the cosmic orgasm. each time, the goal is to get close but not go too far, each time building up energy further. then, finally when it can't be held anymore the orgasm experience is one of gaining consmic consciousness. it effect wasn't my intention because orgasm doesn't really take any skill or technique -- but, watching stars does. it's more a practised frame of mind and a confidence that is a normal thing to do. I liken it to riding a bike, walking, or driving a car.

I want this state of mind to feel natural for me. I really am not in any rush at all to get there.

---

I want to be able to say the same for girls too. I still do not at all feel comfortable with it. it feels too much of a big step and it feels very unnatural still. what I mean is, when I feel comfortable with it, then I'll go for it.

what that means for me is, I want to find my connection and get used to that first. my first goal is to figure out how to make replicas of myself and let the girls play with them for a while. meanwhile this is happening, I want to work on an idea that I haven't talked about much but it's basically another network, but it's powered by the sun.

nosebook operates in the physical world. it transmits a signal into your physical body which then produces an image in your imagination. my system will be the exact opposite. everyone will automatically have one tuned to them. you will feel certain concepts to interact with this network (instead of thinking -- you feel), and then these feelings get transformed and amplifed in a conceptual program which then causes you to feel a way in response, when then that feeling will produce an image in the imagination or a feeling in the body.

it's a conceptual network rather than a physical one. it will naturally create spaces for people of like mind to interact. so, like you don't need to go out and try and find these people in real life -- but instead can interact with them in these spaces.

there are other ideas I have as well, but that's the easiest one to describe.

what this allows me to do is to gain confidence in my capacity to feel the way I want to feel, and I don't have to worry about all of the other stuff.

---

this is really far-out, but I was even thinking of making a whole plot-twist here. I have been talking about how I don't want to be physically focused and want to remain conceptually focused. so, imagine that I enjoy the feeling that all of the different replicas of me feel like and the enjoyment of perceiving all of this from an emotional/conceptual perspective that I make my transition into this conceptual network.

essentially, I am the network. I keep it running and ensure that everything is continually expanding and new things are constantly being felt. I'll have an unlimited supply of physical beings that I can supply the physical realm with. as fast as people can feel the new being it can be created. in fact, that I know of, *any* physical thing can be conjured at will with this sort of setup. all those participating in my network will be able to create anything they feel into reality.

it's kind of an interesting concept. it's so far out, I don't really know where to begin thinking about it, but the cool thing is I don't need to worry about it now. first, make my conceptual network, then I can figure that part out.

---

anyone can do or have anything they feel they can do or have. however, for me, the most interesting part about this is not this physical manifestation. I like the idea of being whatever I want to be.

this is only the beginning.

### 2021-09-15 01:31 - a bit more on the conceptual network

I wasn't trying to imply that I'm planning on making my transition into the conceptual network -- only that the thought was quite invigorating to think about.

the third panel in my mdma vision cards has my saying to a crowd of people, "this is a machine capable of desire" -- because I have wanted to, for a long time, to be able to create autonomous machines capable of desire. I even thought about it a bunch last night -- where you progam a small machine with a manifestation frequency (like dimensions in time or space) and the machine has to figure out how to get there...

I've also wanted to, myself, merge with the machines. the thought of having a form of perception that operates in the MHz or GHz ranges sounds incredible to me. I often thought of this as some sort of device that could condense or simplify the information around me so that I didn't get so much information overload and could reduce or enhance perception on certain things that interested me.

point is, I've given this a lot of thought -- however as I've goten better at this, I realised that 90% of the stuff I wanted this improved perception for can be accomplished in the conceptual world much easier, and it's also far more ergonomic, too.

---

so, the idea of essentially merging with the conceptual worl is enticing to me. I would become a living network that kind of holds the physical layer together. a sort of like secondary source. obviously I can't replace LOA, but there are a lot of different things that can be done...

first, let's just look at normal operation of manifestation of things in the physical world. you feel a thing and the system picks it up, transforms it and then sends it back to you. this all happens instantaneously -- just like LOA -- so no delay on anything. any transformation can be programmed. as in example, you could program it to send you back a feeling of calm when you feel anger -- or maybe like a slight vibration in your muscles -- whatever, really.

when it comes to privacy, it's as private as it can possibly be. only you are you, so only you can access it. you can do pretty much whatever you want with it too. if you want to manifest a hot babe every time you feel horny or lonely, you could do that too. really all things are possible.

I imagine that most people will choose to manifest replicas of theirselves, or specific golems designed to perform certain tasks.

---

obviously not everything will be possible at first, because many things will still need to be discovered and identified. it also is subject to the rules of LOA too, so the vibrations you're trying to inflict on others will also manifest for you. so, like imagine for a moment that you try to destroy something someone else has created... it's not really destroyed, and you're also manifesting for yourself a reality that feels that way too.

imagine then that you want to program a transformation to that destruction. you still need to perform the destruction and also the transformed result to make the transformation, so it wouldn't really be a surprise for them.

let's say someone plays a practical joke and makes a transformation that every time they laugh, you pop a boner... well, you could just transform that transformation too into something else -- like maybe giving them a boner back.

all things can be transformed. also death soon becomes impossible. if you "die" you can just realise yourself again in any body that you desire. you don't even need to die to realise yourself in any body that you want. you are not the physical body. you can have as many bodies as you want and do as many things as you want to do at a time.

---

so, you say, then what's the point if there aren't any stakes. ah, good observation. you would create worlds where there is the illusion of permanence and death and then incarnate into them to have that experience.

I imagine that most of people's time will be spent creating games and worlds where you can win/lose the game. or, they would be interested in making meme realities, jokes and other out of place things which are surprising but not likely that useful.

since I run the network, I would be the custodian... welcome to hell :)

---

the reactions to this are funny. I wonder which is worse -- the mars idea or this one... lol


### 2021-09-15 13:00 - concept vs meaning

I woke up this afternoon to an explosion sound in my head. in the dream, I was pointing out how hollywood takes certain symbols (physical details, actions, etc) and puts them into a sequence, to condition you to belive that whenever you see one symbol, followed by another symbol, then a thing will happen.

this technique has been used for a long time to teach kids what to expect in certain situations -- like what to expect from strangers in tme forest in little red ridinghood. this technique is the foundation upon which all prophecy is built and hollywood employs it everywhere.

it's designed to program your mind to perceive similar symbols in your own life and then come to expect the result that happens in the film.

because most of our lives we learn by watching, many people (including those that make these films) believe these implications are the way that reality works. in fact, a lot of them are reportraying past events from an implication standpoint -- like maybe a past relationship or whatever -- so, people watching begin to expect the same sort of behaviour out of their mate, if they notice similar "signs" of that behaviour.

---

this is what I call the 3-7 form of perception. you pay attention to physical details (7), and then come to conclusions of what will happen based on the percceived logic or implications of those details (3).

aftter raquel, I was caught up in this very badly. like, very very badly. I saw a bunch of things happening (actions) and physical hechos that I then made implications about what was happening. I was totally driving myself so crazy with it that I attracted a very life-changing event -- vallecas.

prior to that I got my first glimpse of abraham and they said that all manifestations that are happening can be traced back to the way I feel. I started to remake a lot of the prior associations I had, and instead of looking at physical details, actions and hechos (things that happened), I looked at how I felt. I started to see pretty quickly that every one of those details were a reflection of the way *I* felt.

I started to value how I felt more and more, so I started to feel better the best way I knew how which was drugs, alcohol, and programming. unfortunately, I still had a lot of those implications hanging around still and I found myself in vallecas...

a number of times I recovered from these bad feelings and could find ways to feel better, but I would then find myself in another situation which would reveal false implications.

for example, when I went to valverde I noticed that people were looking through my eyes, and I started to realise that my eyes are being manipulated. every time that I would go from 3d to 4d, it would go away; the spot in my eye would move around; my vision would get better, then worse when I slept. obviously someone was preventing me from getting to the state I wanted to be at (4d).

the implication was that I was no longer in control over my physical reality. someone could put sounds anywhere, shock my body when I saw any images in my eyes, or whatever to ensure that I couldn't get the manifestation that I wanted (to see creations in my eyes and build incredible things like tesla in my imagination).

because it appeared like they had my physical reality subdued, then the implication was that I would never be able to get what I wanted. it also implied that I had to *fight* the oppressor (just like in the movies) and the righttous man hero would emerge victorious.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRL3wx-ZKsg)

obviously this is totally not the way to go about it. the idea of fighting it only made it worse, and I eventually felt my power slipping away so far that I was entering into a state of depression.

after a complete disablement of my left-side, I found myself back here in the USA. this time, because I felt powerless to get what I wanted, I had severe depression because the implication is that I would never be able get what I wanted. they were using my own capabilities against me. thankfully abraham insisted on reminding me that "it's all attraction" -- and admittedly, I knew they were right, but it was annoying to be wrong about my rightous quest to get the capacity that I had discovered.

I figured out how to watch stars and improve my frequency, so I should be able to use the thing I discovered... right?

---

I've come a long way since then and now those ideas seem very outdated. it doesn't matter what they're doing, and in fact, those things aren't what I really want, anyway. I don't really care about that stuff. nowadays, I have figured out the power of being able to feel any way that I want. that's a lot better than some stupid capability of seeing images or whatever. I'm learning that the concept that one has *is* their reality.

the common way to produce this concept is through pattern recognition and the implication of the next expected result in the pattern is what will manifest.

these concepts either feel good or they don't feel good. if they feel good, they are in alignment with the way you want to feel.

---

I suppose I still have quite a few implications still floating around in a lot of places. I know they're just concepts though.

I'll return to this. I want to think more on it.

---

there is an idea that I have which all paths, lead to the future you. with some taking longer than others (imagine lighnighmg going between two points. it never goes in a straight line). the only thing that prevents you from reaching the destination is an inability to maintain alignment with it -- like say maybe it's transforming too fast or something.

however, all paths do lead to the same location -- just some appear to take more time because they traverse a longer distance.

so really, it's much more about my ability to tune rather than the path to get there. obviously some paths are more desirable than others, but again that has to do with my tuning, and not the environment or the conditions.

still needs more thought...

ok, so there's a difference between feeling physically good (pleasure) and feeling emotionally good (joy or happiness). I probably have a lot of implications still that degrade the feeling of physical manifestations.

I have a lot of people around me still that believe all sorts of things about relationships and when they see certain key things, they freak out. a good example of this was the idea of "wanting what you don't have" or "wanting people to depend on you to feel good". these have huge implications in a lot of people's minds that don't have the same implications in mine.

more thought is definitely needed :)

### 2021-09-15 16:44 - magnetic field of earth

the reason why the magnetic field of earth interests me is because I think the rotation of the earth is directly correlated.

the part about the two satellites being pointed just off of the east coast and the other being pointed just off of the west coast is that the shapes of those curves show that a stronger megnetic field is induced on earth when the sun is straight overhead (perpendicular). that means that as the earth rotates, the sun generates a magnetic field on the surface of the earth which then, if we imagine the core of the earth to be a dynamo, the higher magnetic field will pull the rotor toward it. something similar to this must be how the earth rotates.

therefore, I will consider the crust of the earth to have a rotating magnetic gradient around a rotor (prolly a rocky core of silicates) and this operates like an AC motor.

if I plug a motor into 60Hz electricity, it will rotate 60 times a second (3600rpm). this means that the rotation of the earth roughly matches the frequency. this will yield a roughly constant rotation speed, with the earth rotating as fast as the gradient moves around. everything should be constant -- neither slowing down or speeding up.

however, we know that the earth's rotation was slowing down until 2020 when it started to speed up slightly. I think this has something to do with the magnetic field strength. I wanted to know if the field strength is weakening or not because if my theory is correct, it should be increasing in strength and that's why rotation rate is speeding up.

---

to demonstrate this theory, imagine a standard 60 Hz motor plugged into the wall. run it at 120V and it goes fine. now, lower the voltage gradually and notice that the motor is having trouble to turn as fast because the field isn't strong enough to pull the rotor fast enough.

if we change the setup to one where there is a setup similar to the one where the sun induces the magnetic field, a stronger field will cause the rotor to turn a little bit faster each revolution (accelerate). likewise, a weaker magnetic field will decelerate until it reaches a constant velocity proportional to its field strength -- assuming a constant load, of course.


### 2021-09-16 04:33 - go figure it out

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vik5dL1WfPw)

I have felt a lot of uneasiness going on around going to becky's house. there are a lot of assumptions and stuff.

about that -- the thing is, I think it's OK to talk about these concepts and stuff...

I just listened to the latest snake-bros podcast (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw9BVqDK4Qo)) and I'm totally digging that they're figuring it out for theirselves. they kind of invigorated my inner trickster a bit. I really like that they're doing all of their discovery and stuff. it's really good.

my whole thing is I want to open up the "spirit realm" (or whatever... conceptual realm) so that others can see it. once people begin to have interaction with that, I think a lot of these mysteries will become pretty understandable.

I kind of sit on the fence on this because on one hand, I want to give people magic wands so they can create all the crap they want -- thereby greatly accelerating the realisation that stuff isn't the goal. there was this one part in tesla's autobiography which always stuck to me about his gambling addiction. his mom gave him the money to spend, knowing that only by spending all the cash was the only chance to allow him to make his own decisions.

I'm of the opinion that you have to let people shoot themselves in the foot. it's essential to the learning process. this is the same way. while, I know that that would severely interrupt nosebook's desire to tell people what they can and cannot do, this realm is opposite of the physical one. you cannot do a lot of things here, so the limitation is resources. there, you can do anything you can imagine -- so the limitation is your creativity. almost all creativity is a remix of an existing idea, so this is all about trying stuff out, failing, revising and trying again.

it's a really difficult thing to figure out... if everything is possible, what do you try? imagine you were tasked with trying out the different combinations of DNA (a very large number) to create a new species... it's difficult to explain this concept easily...

in a slightly related incident, I was watching an [ontological discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXW-QjBsruE), and I noticed that I have very strong opinions about what things are and are not (very ironic joke considering the content of the video), and I had this realisation that it must be so annoying for people to hear me say, "no, it's like this ..." and then state my current understanding of the topic as if it were fact.

sorry, that's the way I am and I don't really want to try to see it any other way. I have to make some assumptions to make any progress -- otherwise I go in circles cause I can never be fully sure of anything. I do recognise there is uncertainty to the things I'm saying and my opinion changes all the time as I continue to find a more general implementation of the concept.

from my perspective, though I think my perspective is correct, I don't want to impose that perspective on anyone. I'm willing to offer my suggestions and my current understanding of it, but I don't want it to become doctrine. my own ideas change so rapidly, I could never afford to have something that I believe is unchangable. even source (or God, or supreme deity) I believe is also changing, expanding, and improving. there is nothing that is static and immovable.

so, even though I'm nearly 100% certain that there will be some beady-eyed opportunists that'll take some of the things that I say here and turn it into a system that reinforces their authority on the matter, I don't want to have any part in that. there are a lot of people that want to be told what to do and how it works, and those guys are for them.

those people are not for me. I'm willing to offer my ideas, but figure it out for yourself, ya know. I don't have all of the answers because no one ever will have it all figured out -- just better and better explanations of it.

I like that people are figuring it out for theirselves. I believe that's what this domain is actually designed to have.

---

the reason why I said that is because I was thinking about the custodians and stuff and how it all fits in here.

imagine for a moment that all of this is a simulation, and it's a sort of genetic algorithm designed to harden the system.

if a virus came to your system, knocked on the door and said, "I'm the good guy; let me in" your friend may ask, "how do you know he's the good guy?" "well, because he told me he was, of course" -- that sort of thing sounds silly, but that's about the extent of "security" people have with most channeling.

to make the game more difficult, LOA is a real thing, so you get what you're tuned to, so someone who is on the lookout for a monster around every corner is going to find a lot of monsters, and that distrust actually attracts them. it's like they can smell it. you want to be on the lookout for the desirable things. however, a person who is naive will also get duped a whole bunch of times too.

the system appears to be optimising for someone who is naive so as to attract desirable realities, yet can recover easily/rapidly from any setbacks. intuitive enough to recognse the undesirable without even interacting with it or attracting it in the first place, and also capable of figuring out the nature of reality as a reflection of them so they're able to amplify the desirable aspects.

that can probably be said in a better way. I'll think about it, but one thing I seem to be noticing is that the reality around us is in the business of deception.

---

I guess what I'm saying here is that I want to keep offering as many ideas as I can, which I'm sure are not *the way*. they are *a way* -- of many possible ways. nature loves redundancy. anyone who says they are the only one true way has drank the custodial koolaid and are part of the simulation designed to compromise the easily infiltratable.

all of these phenomenon are just mega amplifiers of your concept of reality. need a saviour -- the galactic guardians will save you from your crappy reality. want some power? try this ritual.. how about 200X boosting your internet connection?

lol.

### 2021-09-17 03:19 - and the lord spake unto moses...

...that *the LORD thy God* shall harden the heart of the pharoah and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land therein..

naw, just kidding... right? the last few days I've been continuing to lower my own resistance. the thing is, the whole girls thing doesn't feel as bad anymore, so I'm not really fighting it so much anymore.

I still think it'll be a rather bumpy ride though. my main reason for wanting to hold off for as long as possible is that I wanted to try and figure out my own way toward getting the mars thing going.

since, I've come up with the concept of passing on the magic wand. I thought maybe originally I wanted it to be invite-only, however I've changed my mind to making it a conceptaul thing. I still like the idea that girls can invite others to join the conceptual network, but I don't think that's a necessary thing anymore.

I still haven't worked out all of the details on that, but I do want for more replicas to be created, though I don't think this'll happen very soon.

what I'm learning is that this isn't necessarily a battle (it's not a battle -- just I don't have another word for it) of conditions, but instead a conceptual engagement. what I mean by that is kinda like what abraham would always say about conflict -- telling people to change their point of attraction (concept of reality) and those incompatible will vibrwate right out of your experience.

I started to think in @[newblog](2021-09-13 03:17) about the different things that would be detestible to nosebook as a way to try and force the egyptians out of egypt...

obviously that's not going to work and I would be attracting a similar sort of incompatible reality for myself as well. the original goal was a physical separation instead of a temporal one.

I pretty much came to the conclusion that there isn't anything that needs to be done actually. all that I have to do is follow the road that feels like the right way and course-correct as I go. doing that, I should get there OK.

so, I stopped having so much resistance, and it felt from my perspective like some people were very concerned about this. personally, I don't mind how long the pharoah's heart is hardened, because I'm really not in a rush at all.

so, I feel like I want to watch this video and lindsey is talking about the character arc of the little mermaid. I've never seen this movie before, so I don't have much context to go by either.

the first thing I noticed is her name. her name is aries with an l -- so, like a feminine mix of mars and saturn. she has a bunch of earthly books and wants to be a human. her father neptune (the original chief god of atlantis) forbids her from her books or something like that. he fights her desire for human knowledge. I don't know the story but neptune gives up his power to a witch.

this reminded me of the chimera -- a mythical beast having lion, goats and snakes. OK, so mythologically speaking atlantis (of which neptune was first ruler) fell about 12kya at the end of leo. the lion is always connected with this terrible and ferocious female goddess (innana, ishtar, sekhmet) having power over the lion and sometimes she is clothed with a lion's body -- always she has an attractive female body with the face of a male lion (drag king?).

the fact that this female influence coming and overthrowing the kingdom of neptune could not have been perceived by all as having been a good thing.

the chimera is also the offspring of typhon and echidna. in a previous nosedocs, I make the case that typhon is the destructive side of velcan. I also have implied that vulcan is likely another incarnation of saturn (satan).

anywaay, typhon and echidna give birth to a lot of monsters that heracles has to fight in his trip through the zodiac. also, I'd like to mention that I believe the suffix "cles" is like "ovich" meaning "son of" -- so like, son of hera -- which was also vulcan -- so like his counterpart, or the same guy. either way, the picture I get is that one makes the monsters and the other defeats them.

back to ariel. I don't really know how you mix two dudes to get a girl, unless you were a genetics superstar and could sew x chromosomes together to make an x2 or an x4 (depending if it's the immortal or physical twin).

anyway, I think I should probably watch the little mermaid. I'm surprised at how "prophetic" it is. that, and hercules, actually (see where I'm going with this?).

---

the next thing that caught my eye was when she says that ariel has a very simple charaacter arc. most disney protagonists go through the monomyth, but ariel knows what she wants and gets it. the entire struggle is external. I probably should hate identifying with a disney princess, but from what I gather, I see myself a lot in ariel.

I would assume that I'm not though.. like she's similar to me, but not me -- so, I had a look at the [monomyth](/img/monomyth.jpg). I noticed that I am heading down both the left and the right side of the chart there, and it appears that I'm gonnna meet right there in the middle at the temptation, right between "meeting with the goddess" and "attonment with the father" stages.

---

that's all I have to say for now. it wouldn't surprise me if some of the story gets a rewrite.

### 2021-09-18 02:42 - thinking on the rewrite

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qh7YV23aRY)

I just watched that and I noticed that the 12 labours of heracles are also quite similar to the future outline I lost in the disk crash, and also to the final stretch after the death of enkidu in the epic of gilgamesh.

there is one interesting part where when fighting the hydra, it seems to continue to regrow its heads during the traversal through cancer. after cancer, there must have been a reversal because now we're in saggitarius with the centaurs.

then, after clearing out a whole bunch of crap with a lot of water (flood?), he kills some birds and we're back to fighting bulls. this would seem to be taurus, but in my narrative I have this part ending in gemini. the labours seem to suggest that girls cause heracles many problems. the girdle gets the amazon girls killed. the next one has cattle causing problems again, and is somehow related to termenting heat. heracles threatens to kill the sun and is given a spaceship in return. he rounds up the cows and sets up two pillars (gemini?).

I don't believe that these cows symbols are of taurus because these cows seem to produce a lot of waste and need to be rounded up. perhaps the bull is related to taurus, but the cows I think are the feminine principal -- giving milk or sacrificed for food. the mortal female

finally the apples of the garden are to be fetched, and this is (IMO) the immortal female. in order to accomplish this, the sky needs to be held up (this seems to be a reference to the atlantians and their electrification of the sky). seems heracles almost fumbles the sky, and tricks atlas to holding it up again.

mission accomplished. he goes and celebrates and then get loose with women again. his wife, wanting to regain his love actually poisons him with hydra blood -- the snake tyrant that kept reproducing double instead of killing it. this I believe is a reference to "job" and the general principal that every force produces double (see story of gob). the hydra was good at returning what it lost in double proportions. well, this same capacity when applied to heracles, kills his mortal self (the end of gemini).

the last scene is cerberus, the 3-headed dog. I find it likely that sirius has a third star, and this is cerberus. this is the closest approach to sirius in the underworld. from there, we probably flip over and now back into scorpio or libra (dunno which one).

therefore I must conclude that the "opposition" to hercules is hera. she is an interesting character that I think is well portrayed (in modern eyes) by ursela (bear lady) in little mermaid. this opposition seems to drive heracles to perform these labours -- so therefore I will consider heracles in this context to be the martian task force, or gilgamesh. the cattle are symbolic of the earth humans. the amazonas are likely the more powerful females on earth.

consider this to be the frame for the rest of this discussion.

---

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/KznZcK7ksf4?t=974)

on the subject of superman vs rocky, to me, it feels like they're trying to move away from the superman christ-like narrative and move instead toward a rocky-like narrative for heracles, who was born with godlike powers -- just he needs to train to be able to use them. 

so, while I do identify a bit with heracles in this, I consider heracles to be the x3 models -- making my character hera :)

---

this presents an interesting difficulty because the rocky story is that rocky is the underdog that is going to fight heavyweight champion apollo. he lasts pretty long (like heracles), but in the end is defeated.

the superman narrative is weird -- and it also *does not* fit the martians either, so that won't work.

---

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIIWy3TZ1eI)

the final thing to discuss here is the hunchback narrative. I've never seen it and I never heard the story before tonight, so I'm a bit blind. some things to note is that the esmerelda reminds me of the "dark lady" sonnets -- more sexual than the "fair youth" sonnets/princesses.

the story is that the hunchback is the physically inferior to frollo. his name means "almost like" or I would say, "almost formed" or "almost there". frollo apparently means "killed by arthur". I also don't know anything on arthur, but I'm assuming that arthur is some super awsome dude that had the female power (holy grail), so frollo appears to be labeled as the jealous/inferior rival type of arthur.

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/AIIWy3TZ1eI?t=1656)

this sequence "it's fine" appears to me as a passing on of something... I will assume that esmerelda is the "holy grail", that he is passing it on to the new apollo (captain phoebus).

### 2021-09-19 23:53 - little more on the rewrite

I have been thinking about those story elements I talked about in the last few entries on the rewrite. even though I have some similarities to the hercules story (especially the disney one), I contend that this is the future story of the martians over the next 6ky, told symbolically through the form of heracles.

I do however have a lot more similarities to the rocky and quasimodo stories though. when thinking on the rocky one, his story is to train physically as hard as he can to defeat the heavyweight champion, apollo. he makes it all the way up to the last round but is ultimately defeated by apollo. quasimodo is similar in that he passes on esmerelda to apollo.

so I was thinking about the rocky story. he is training really hard to defeat apollo, but that training is physical. my situation is similar, but my goal is not physical strength, but instead the capacity to feel the way I want to feel, and then be able to be anything I want to be.

I was talking with mom about this, this morning and I was explaining how I feel a bit of a hypocrite because I talk about all of these things that I cannot do. if I truly could feel the way I want to feel, I wouldn't have trouble to pee. I could also navigate time very easily too.

these last few days provided two very clear examples of this too. the first was yesterday when I went to becky's and I simply could not eat all day. my stomach hurt and everything sounded terrible to me. I also had a very difficult time to pee.

the effects that this had were notable. I really felt very strongly how much disinterest I have in getting back to concerning myself with the mundane. I don't care about football, and I don't care about someone's inability to figure out how to feel good. none of that is anything that I want anything to do with. so, sure I can lower my resistance and perceive that all paths eventually lead toward the creating of the thing I want, for some reason I still feel strong distaste for a path that involves such a material/mendane approach to it. I want to feel the way I want to feel. the irony is, sure if I am placed in that situation, I can *definitely* feel the way I want to feel, it is not something that I think I would choose.

so again, I'm a hypocrite. I say to find a way to feel the way I want to feel no matter the circumstance, and then reject the circumstance because I don't feel good, instead of finding a way to feel good.

the second good example of this was today. I woke up and I was feeling pretty good. even though I did feel pretty bad, it was still quite an improvement over previous performances, and I did think I was doing better. when I woke up, I had a strong feeling that today was a trajectory toward something happening. it felt very strong to me. I think I then lost consciousness, and I can't remember the order of events, but one thing I remember is how uninterested I felt being stuck in a life with the mundane details of ordinary public school life. I also found my stomach was hurting quite a bit and I was very unable tco pee again.

however the order of events happened doesn't matter; when I returned back to consciousness, I really did not feel well at all. I even had a nosebleed, which is something that is very very uncommon for me (I have to get hit; it never just happens)

I'm pretty certain that the difference between how I felt before and after directly modified my trajectory through time (eg. switched timelines).

---

so, in the sense that I'm rocky, my objective is not to defeat my opponent physically, but to be able to feel the way I want to feel. it appears that their capacity to manipulate the physical aspects of my body still has an effect on how I feel emotionally/conceptually.

the other major realisation for me was that I realised that no matter what is happening, they'll always just adjest the way I feel to alter that trajectory. therfore, seems safe to say that nothing will happen with the girls until all timelines possible must traverse that event, so as to make it completely unavoidable.

---

so that brings me to my final point here. I'm getting better and better at feeling the way I want to feel, but I want to really master it. this isn't a championship title in that I only have to defeat them once. I have to be good at it so that it feels natural and normal for me to feel the way I want to feel. so, just like my star-watching, I'll probably get good at feeling the way I want to feel, keep doing it, but right before anything manifests, I'll just let the conditions carry the moment as everything seems to fall apart. this gives me and also others a chance to get good at feeling the way they want to.

there's nothing inherently wrong or bad about any of the conditions that people are in right now. it's just the perception of them that feels bad.

so, for example, today I was studying football. I don't want to fight against it, so I study it instead. it's funny how this ties right in to the conversation that I had with that guy on saturday about where I get my news: the conspiracy therists. I study the proposed bad guys and their objectives and then work my way back to reality.

well same thing here, so I take the thing I don't like (the mundane interaction of american football) and I study it to find my way back to reality. I noticed that there's a ton of bean-counting on time (time-shortage consciousness), and an official declaration of what happened (referee), and commentators on the action (fox/cnn news) complete with replays and analysis if the official declaration is correct or if there should be outcry.

it's exactly like american government and politics played out in real-life. I remembered the quote from mcluhan quote about how sport and games are modeled conceptually to illustrate the successful aspects of a culture's achievements and play them out in a structrued and organised form. american football is a game that is showing us how we have distilled our success and expansion into a game. this isn't a game of wit secrets, planning ahead, etc, like chess. it's a different game.

I propose that it's a game of propulsion. the goal is to push the ball through the resistance as forcefully as possible. sometimes it involves some trickery, but it's mostly brute force, of which you get 3-4 attempts to try and push it throgh an acceptable distance before being forced to give up and try to make it as hard as possible for the opposition to return the favour. I was watching the cowboys and the chargers, but it may as well have been repubicans and democrats, or USA and iraq.

interestingly, I was talking to the same guy about how our technology reflects our consciousness (another idea I lifted from mcluhan), and that we won't be able to progress much further technologically (especially space travel) until the propultion-only paradigm gets changed to one of attraction.

---

so, in a bigger picture of things, I can see that there are a lot of people out there that like to push things forward, whether it's mentally or physically -- so, while I do think it would be a great idea to have good conditions, with which we can all experience and enjoy, it appears that the manifestation that I want (to feel the way I want to feel) seems to be directly linked to that separation.

intuitively, I reasoned that I did not imagine that any girls would be happening until a separation has occurred -- either physically or temporally. I'm starting to see this playing out more and more all the time.

instead of trying to get any single event to manifest, I want to get so good at feeling the way I want to feel, that it doesn't matter what is happening.

I was thinking to stop talking about the difficulties, but the reality is, these are OK because my attention to them trying to manipulate my timeline by the way I feel is giving me more and more practise at it. they'll continue to get better at it too, and when we finally split, they'll be so good at it, apollo will have finally defeated me -- but not entirely because I'll be with a bunch of people that also know how to feel the way they want to feel.

because, love...

### 2021-09-21 23:11 - all or nothing: here's another way to make none

I have been thinking about what the origin of the present predicament is, and it appears to be that they desire to have my consciousness: that is, the way I perceive things. I think it allows for good deduction and reasoning and capability to perceive beyond just what is presented in the image. essentially, they like the way I perceive things *feels*, making everything feel more vibrant and alive -- however, but they don't want me to have that form of perception, because my capacity to feel makes it difficult for them to hide things.

yesterday, I was explaining that I believe kids (especially girls) have a similar capacity to perceive what others are feeling around them, however, they don't have a framework to put that sense into words or thought which would be recognisable to adults. I have the unique capability of having adult logic and reasoning capability while retaining the perception of a child.

after that, I started to get some reactions about an idea of transfering my consciousness into a kid. being stuck once again inside of a body that does not yet have a developed enough brain to translate that perception into words and ideas, they are once again safe from someone as perceptive as I am from explaining to adults in words what is plainly going on behind the illusion.

if I'm never given the ability to reach puberty or I come to all kinds of resistant conclusions during puberty like most do, then I'll never be able to translate that consciousness into anything meaningful.

the body is receiving a stream of consciousness from your source, and it is giving you all sorts of information about everything and everyone you're interacting with. as a child we learn to shut that down because adults tell us to not listen to that intuition (and instead listen to them). that consciousness source continues to flow even if the body is not capable of translating it into reality, so technically I believe they could continue to use my consciousness even if I never develop a body/brain capable of translating it into something meaningful.

---

I don't really mind if that's what they want to do. they could keep transferring my consciousness into newborns over and over, never allowing me to get to puberty. from my perspective, this doesn't make much of a difference because I won't be conscious for most of it. as soon as I start to gain consciousness, they'll just move me to another newborn again.

I imagine the feeling would be something how I experinece sleep right now. in my dreams, I know that ever time that I'm on the verge of becoming consciousness, something happens and it goes away. so, in that sense it would be also like sleep in that I don't really perceive any passage of time. I just lose consciousness and then I wake up -- even though a lot of time has passed while I was gone.

---

it also creates kind of an interesting effect in that I'm certain that even though I'm not conscious, my source will continue to try and find ways to become conscious. therefore, I imagine that I'll optimise the process to where I become conscious, finding ways to become conscious more and more rapidly all of the time. certainly, they'll have to find more and more difficult situations and parents to put me with, so it'll also optimise for undesirable conditions as well. if I were a plant, I would be a weed.

you can imagine how much desire this will continue to create to become conscious. I'm reminded of this thing -- where when a child has a desire and the parent tries to prevent it from happening. for most, they just forget about it -- however, for some they cannot just let it go and they *have* to have it (whatever it is). the more they want it, the more chaos and destruction begins to take place until the child is allowed to do what they want to do (this begins to become very noticable during puberty). that amount of desire to become conscious would continue to grow until it is allowed to happen. so, like even if you were to put me with difficult parents, their lives would fall apart until I was allowed what I want. desire is a powerful thing; the most powerful force in the universe, in fact.

so while I do think it would be a bit of a setback and a bit annoying to have to start over many times more to get to where I'm at now, again -- but, I don't doubt the power of desire. I'm pretty certain I'll find my way. I also think it's kind of a cool thing too, because humans are very fragile and rely a lot on a nurturing envirenment to survive the early years. in contrast, a deer may be walking around a few hours after birth, and a reptile or insect is fully ready to go after hatching, just needing to grow a little bigger.

this process would greatly reduce the time it takes for a human to gain consciousness. I can imagine being bern, and within a few hours I'm already floating around and taking on the form that I choose, and begin to try things out and go from there.

I guess I'm sorta down to take the hit here allowing them to continue to use my consciousness while I optimise the gaining consciousness phase of the human species. I guess it's sorta necessary to take over. soon there will be no separation between us. all children will be born directly into my form of perception and consciousness.

sounds like a worthwhile sacrifice so they can ensure I never become conscious enough to reveal their secrets -- I guess...


### 2021-09-22 02:44 - a bit of rationalisation

a bit of a reply to a few reactions wondering why in the world would I suggest such a thing...

well, it takes the whole "need not the manifestation" thing to the extreme. the last thing I want to do is to rely on a manifestation to feel good. this takes that and raises it to a whole nother level. I'm just not really concerned about it. the thing I want is to have the capacity to feel the way I want to feel. like... you know, however I want to feel, physically or emotionally. I'm learning very rapidly the techniques to do that every day, and literally every day I notice that I'm still learning new things.

it's a bit hard to describe them, as they're starting to get sufficiently abstract that it's difficult to explain them with words. the best way to say it perhaps would be a confidence or a knowing, coupled with a much more real-time awareness of how I feel. I still react and stuff so to the outside world it probably looks still about the same. to explain, imagine I bite my fingernails becaus I'm nervous. I could try and do my best to stop biting my fingernails, but the manifestation of that nervousness will appear in other places. that's kind of why I let those manifestations occur, because I get the evidence of how I feel instead of trying to suppress (or hide) it.

what I mean is, I'm finding form of perception which allow me to feel relaxed, rather that trying to change the nervousness.

the reason why this is important to me is because instead of trying to figure out the right thing to say or do or whatever, I can just be so practised at feeling the way I want to feel, it's effortless.

I don't really have to pay anything for it, other than time -- of which, I'm mosly unconscious anyway. it's truly one of those "improve yourself while you sleep" sort of gimmicks. I only had to come up with something so amazing someone is willing to invest a tremendous amount of time and effort into coming up with technology to prevent me from ever becoming conscious with it.

I have no rush to try and get any (specific) manifestation anyway. the ability to feel what I want *is* the manifestation. with that capacity I can manifest *anything* I want anyway -- instead of just one thing.

if someone comes to you and gives you a wish, you would wish to have unlimited wishes, right? hopefully, anyway... that seems the most obvious wish for me...

likewise, on the opposite side of things it's also quite good because it also allows for others to also not need a manifestation and feel the way they think the manifestation will allow them to feel.

---

so, why would I want to duck out early? well, it's that all or nothing thing. let's look at the sequence of events to try and derive some meaning from it...

1. I wanted to go for all because I didn't like the way it felt to have so many people depending on me for feeling good.
2. later, I realised that having people depend on me for how they want to feel is actually a fine thing when looking from a solar perspective.
3. I decided OK, fine I'll just go with some girls and work my way up to getting connected so that I can do all -- or, perhaps instead of that maybe we could figure out a way for the girls to be able to make their own replicas and make more for their friends
4. that idea was met with some difficulty, and there was a simple desync between the reality that I wanted to live and the reality I would be put into. I preferred the conceptual reality more than being forced to be physically focused.
5. because I am an adult, I can choose the reality that I want, and I suppose I'm a bit of a snob in that I'd rather not be stuck in a mundane reality of worry and appearance.
6. some revision into the story that is to be told was done. the conclusion that I came to is that #3 is the rocky story. that story parallels the hercules story a bit, which is similar to mine. however, the disney story has very little to do with the labours of heracles story, which I believe is the martians/gilgamesh's story after enkidu dies.
7. a second story of notre dame (our lady) is prposed where quasimodo passes on the dark lady to the new apollo. this parallels the rocky (the earth) holding out till the final round in it's battle against apollo (the sun). in both cases, the torch is passed on and requires a rewrite to accomodate this.
8. while contemplating the implementation of this, there was the sound of many motors a new water heater and a new idea manifested of transferring my consciousness into a child's body, forcing me to be physically focused in a material world determined by my parents (andrew and jessica?) where I'd depend on them, and have to learn reality through their framework
9. sure, it's definitely annoying to start over, but I can see the advantage of getting the practise to finding a way to feel the way I want to feel. andrew (or whomever) will almost certainly provide a difficult enough challenge to fuel that desire.

it's not like it's the best sequence to give it meaning but it solves all of their problems, and only creates a few more. let's go over them here...

solutions:
1. I am no longer capable of revealing secrets because I can't even speak english or have the ability to construct a meaningful thought because my brain hasn't developed enough to do so.
2. no longer do they have to worry about me seeing images. I simply don't have the capacity from birth, so it's not like it's even a thing.
3. entire portions of my brain can be disabled and certainly I'll still find a way. no worries if that produces paralysis or inability to pee. again, if I'm born that way, then the brain figures out how to perform the task within the framework it's given.
4. I get to become completely unstoppable. obviously, this won't last forever; I will find a way.
5. if I make my transition now, I believe the earth's magnetic field will severly weaken. I don't know if this is dsetermined to be desired or not. this will allow the earth to begin to rotate in the opposite direction.
6. considering the traditional way of accomplishing someone else's form of perception through sex, there will be zero girls that got my perception the natural way. they will only have got it through nosebook (which likely has a limited featureset and is heavily controlled). this eliminates a uncontrolled spread of my perception to others

problems:
1. I get to become completely unstoppable. obviously, this won't last forever; I will find a way.
2. who will they broadcast in my place? they could broadcast the kid, I guess but that may not be as exciting. I dunno.
3. andrew may not want to be broadcasted
4. if they reveal they have the capacity to transfer consciousness, that may be undesirable. or, perhaps the healthcare industry could find a way to capitalise on moving their consciousness instead of keeping those dead people alive.
5. if I make my transition now, I believe the earth's magnetic field will severly weaken. I don't know if this is dsetermined to be desired or not. I think increased magnetic field means more perception/energy and faster speed of light. I also think it means shorter days as rotation speeds up.

more to think about still...

### 2021-09-22 11:12 - transferr of consciousness

I first began to think about this idea a lot when I found out that terence died at nearly the same time that I had a brain haemorrhage. I know I'm not him but I figured there could be a method to transfer some portions of consciousness between people in altered states of consciousness during death.

later on, I found out that both during birth and death, the brain has extremely high levels of DMT in it. I know that I too have higher than normal quantites of DMT in my brain regularly. I equate levels of DMT to be quantity of non-physical (desire, perception, etc) one is capable of transmitting. this also happens when you dream, and one will know that an ayahuasca trip is very different than a dram (though still similar). the reason why they're so different is because the dream is DMT that you produced and is therefore tuned to your source. the ayahuasca (or mushroom) DMT is tuned to the consciousness/source of that plant which is why similar quantites of DMT from different sources produce very different experiences.

I have concluded that during both birth and death you are the most allowing of your source.

#### what is your source?

start with a seed and consider that the "source" of the plant encoded into physical code. if you plant the seed in one set of conditions, it will grow up one way. plant it in another environment, it'll grow up looking and behaving differently depending on those conditions. imagine yourself as similar to tme plant.

now, as you go through life, you encounter difficculties. those difficulties produce a desire to superar those difficulties with greater and greater ease. you have a concept of yourself. this is the thing that produces the image of yourself. this is your physical concept of yourself. your non-physical concept of yourself is your source. that is an amalgamation of desire and other things we would consider mental tasks (logic/structure/implications). the physical concept of yourself has to find a way of keeping up with the non-physical concept of yourself.

the way I believe this works is, the body is tuned to a source signal and that signal (from our perspective) is constant and unique[^1]. the body/automaton has to find a way to stay in sync with that signal. obviously that would be impossible for a baby to do right away, so our DNA is designed such that the different faculties allowing one to translate more and more of this source signal into reality slowly become activated.

I place these roughly into 11 year cycles (and corresponding 5.5y and 2.75y cycles[^2]) and as more and more of these faculties come online the more conscious and capable of translating non-physical energy into physical reality manifestations you become.

if you can keep up with the non-physical concept you have of yourself meanwhile these faculties are coming online, then you will continue to grow. if you can't maintain sync with that concept, then these faculties will slowly begin to fail, eventually resulting in death.

I saw an interesting phenomena on youtube that rupert sheldrake presented called "terminal lucidity". what I think is happening there is during the dying process, the parts of the body which hold memories/perceptions which keep a person out of sync (althsheimers, dementia, etc) begin to deactivate, allowing the person a greater amount of consciousness (higher levels of DMT). this higher level of consciousness doesn't usually change the sickness so the body continues to deteriorate and consciousness continues to rise. I think this is also the reason for NDEs as well. when the body is no longer actively blocking the reception of its source with its perception, memory, etc. it allows the person to become superconscious for a moment and resync their perspective a bit.

---

anyway... as more and more parts of the body responsible for resistant forms of perception and memory die off, more and more of one's source is allowed, raising the levels of DMT in the brain.

likewise, when the baby takes its first breath, there is a tuning of a source signal (or signals) -- likely resonant with the people, oxygen, etc. in the environment -- tuning the body to a compatible source.

---

my experience of getting tuned to the source of another may have happened when I was born, but I don't remember that. the other experiences were likely in the hospital after the brain haemorrhage and in vallecas.

so, it is possible to acquire other sources after birth, I think birth is the easiest and the one I want to focus on.

the way that nosebook does it may be different, because I think they're interested in retaining a lot more resistant ideas. I'm not interested in keeping those around. for example, during the time of the saturnian golden age, I think energies were so high that if you died, you would leave your body, fly around till you found a new body that you liked, and then influence it so it feels like you do and can then "walk-in" and posess that new body for yourself (likely evicting the old soul).

this is not what I'm talking about, as that method was designed (probably on purpose by saturn) to allow them to continue to incarnate into bodies without dying.

---

this method of tuning to the brain of the baby to the brain of the person dying really only is a technological capacity that is starting to become available. it requires the syncronisation of births and deaths and other things.

I don't want to get too bogged down with the marketing details, as that's a job for the amun priesthood. my goal is to say that when you die, all of the stuff that was preventing you from keeping up with that concept of yourself dies with it. the best opportunity to transfer a consciousness from one to another retaining only the non-resistant concepts is this way. like I said. I'm sure they have a method for transferring resistant concepts between bodies, but that's not my goal. I like the idea of starting over like that.

---

there are other interesting applications for this as well. assume for a moment that we recognise the capability of tuning into people's consciousness at a point in the past -- well, then you could also tune into their death too. if you want the baby you're carrying to contain parts of different people's sources, then tune the baby to those people's deaths during the first breath.

the other place this is good for doing is, imagine that you're running a new "realty" show based off of the nosebook network and you want specific actors. tuning the truman show babies to the composite actors death will produce a baby tuned to the composite improvements on the previous actors.

[1]: the variations are too small to even be measured by us, and when we get the capability to measure those variations now, source will already be out of our reach frequentially. they're growing as fast as we are and always out ahead. we can never catch up completely. if this happens, the universe will make it's transition

[2]: this is why I believe your logical capabilities start to kick in at 11, 13 is when puberty is starting to really be felt, and 16 is when you're considered conscious enough to drive responsibly

### 2021-09-22 22:44 - 11y solar cycle

after writing that I think the human progresses on an 11y cycle, I had the sense to check to see if the sun has an exact 11y cycle. my intuition said no, and I also really wanted to look up jupiter's orbit period. turns out it's 11.862y long. I look up the solar cycles and wikipedia shows a pretty convincing graph of solar cycles beginning with 12 back in 1878. before that, I will consider the data to be unreliable. wikipedia also says that the cycle starts dec 1878, and cycle 24 ending in dec 2019. a simple calculation reveals that 2019-1878 is 141y for 12 cycles. 141 / 12 = 11.75

that's close enough for me. what that means is that jupiter's orbit is related to the solar cycle. I then remembered an animation I saw about the 720 degree spin of an electron.

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/pWlk1gLkF2Y?t=569)

btw, when I just opened that, my views count is "1,444,044" -- weird coincidence I guess..

anyway, looking at the animation, pay attention to the ribbons connected at the equator and imagine that one of those is jupiter and instead of the cube rotating, the ribbons are rotating. see how the ribbon goes above, then below the cube. imagine the cube is the sun and it should all make sense now (woulda been even more cool if it were a black cube too).

---

I believe this has something to do with the ancient legends of jupiter dethroning saturn as the solar deity. likewise it's quite reasonable to think that at one time when uranus rotated upright, he had a stronger magnetic field and therefore was the solar deity.

what I mean is that the ancients must have known that the solar cycle is coupled to the planet with the strongest magnetic field.

---

I also noticed that the faster spinning planets have higher hydrogen concentrations, with the more dense elements being converted to hydrogen. this must be the alchemical (purification) proceess that planets go through on their quest to transform into a pure and perfect sphere star.


### 2021-09-22 23:18 - transferring consciousness again

get your speculation goggles on for this one :)

I had a few reactions wondering how the transfer of consciousness works. this is going to be very unscientific because I don't have any real data to go with. I'm fairly certain that I was likely a transferred consciousness likely at conception to kind of begin the trajectory, then perhaps at birth too. I think the conception one was of very resistant consciousness, and then at birth I had gained a consciousness more similar to the one I have now. I think the brain haemorrhage was also another big change. I may have been tuned to various consciousnesses then (I specifically remember interacting with a being I identified as jesus). I also had a pretty serious change again right before the "foster the people" concert in berlin; lot's of time missing and I felt very strange and a forboding distance to raquel afterward, too. I'm 100% certain that I picked up another or many consciousnesses in 2013 during the vallecas episode, too.

I would also count the time with vera (cause I felt like marcos afterward) and my first time in the brothel as having similar feelings as well. regarding the one with marcos, I often have wondered if after making the decision to sabotage a timeline, how many people would build conceptual programs to control their body and then transfer their consciousness into my body and ride along experiencing this reality as if they were me.

what I mean to say is that this subject is less of a defined "me" and "you" and is much more of a gradient. from your source's perspective, you're actually free to experience any perspective inside of the universe you desire -- just you are experiencing this one because it is the most interesting to you (addicted to this reality, or want to accomplish something or whatever). the reality is, we're all much more of a conglomerate of sources that we then decide, this is where me begins and me ends.

this subjuct of "who is me" is about the same as the discussion of "do chairs exist?" (reference to vsauce video in @[newblog](2021-09-16 04:33)). it's hard to know where you begin and end. you define that yourself and say these cells are "me".

---

I have memory of what it's like to be very young now, and I think it's only because of my predicament. the way I remember it is that I find myself in a space. I guess you could consider it black, but it's not necessarily any colour. it can be any colour and transforms and moves dynamically with thought. I have superconsciousness in that I know everything that's happening around me. I can feel my environment and everyone in it. I'm mostly curious to why they feel so strangely.

I begin to get sensations and at first I don't know what they are. weeks later, I'll begin to start to feel the physical touch, but for now I just feel the people touching me, not physically yet but conceptually. I know everything about them and can sense their intentions.

I suppose from the parent's perspective, I'm reacting strangely to the things they're doing. from my perspective, I react to things I feel and no one can see what I see. the parents just hear crying.

most of the time is spent reacting to things. slowly I'm beginning to communicate what I can perceive better and better into ideas and then later words. I remember that I think that everyone can feel what I feel and understand what I'm thinking. obviously, they cannot but I try anyway. to me it looks like I'm explaining a full concept to them. to them, it probably looks like disobedience or crying.

from what I can remember, I don't really start seeing out of my eyes and moving my body intentionally for quite some time. I don't really know how I learned to walk, but I feel like it was more like 5 or so wben I started to move my body directly instead of just thinking to go there and then waiting for my body to catch up.

I feel like I existed mostly outside of my body for the majority of my early years, mostly confused as to what it was doing and what was happening around me. it feels to me like I operated my body kind of like it was an automaton.

as time went on, I started to see mere and more out of my eyes and I was beginning to be convinced that the body that I'm looking out of is "me". when I think, it moves and other stuff. lots of stuff excites me as I interact with my world and everything feels like there's so much new and exciting things to do.

my most difficult thing was trying to figure out why some things made me feel bad. I always wanted to do the good-feeling stuff, but I had some blocks that prevented me from a lot of them because I couldn't understand what I was feeling.

---

the major thing to take away from this is that I did not really start moving my body deliberately till very late and I didn't become conscious of my emotions until even later. I was mostly confused for most of my childhood reacting to my circumstances.

I was very perceptive, so I could easily feel my parent's responses to me and when they were trying to give me orders that didn't feel good. I remember that I would follow my intuition, but that would get me into trouble, so I had to follow their commands. however, I wanted good commands where if I obeyed them, then I was good. that wasn't always the case. sometimes it was impossible to follow their commands and get a good result. not following their commands also yielded a bad result too.

I started to keep things a secret they wouldn't like and tell them what they wanted to hear. like, I knew when to tell on my siblings and when not to. over time I figured out that it was better to do what needed to be done (instead of disobeying), but to also be sure to tell them what they wanted to hear. I forget how long my no (want to) phase lasted, but I found it to be inefficient to get the results that I wanted.

I later became more and more results oriented, which made it difficult for me to understand my emotions. now, however I know much better, and it's quite likely most of my training this time around will stick, and I know that my results are reflective of how I feel, not what I'm saying or doing.

---

it seems plainly obvious to me that I want to find a way to carry that knowing that what I feel is more important. this will allow me to continue to operate my body from a feeling standpoint, just feeling the objective that I want and allowing my body to do the work, without needing to get so tangled up in the physical senses so much.

I noticed that the more I felt physically, the less I felt emotionally.

I'm kind of excited to try and get good at this. almost certainly, this document will persist some time and people will use it as a reference to try and keep me as physically focused as possible, trying to ensure that I don't get so much esp again like I have now.

as much as they want to try and keep me physically focused, my goal is to continually try to make my reality an emotional/conceptual one rather than a physical/material reality with only actions and meaning to separate the components from the interactions.

it may take me a while to figure it out and a lot of conflict in the process, but bring it on :)

---

hopefully that helped to explain the transfer of consciousness. the main reason why it's so difficult to articulate it, is that we are so used to thinking that the stuff people say is real, unless they're lying -- but it's a gradient of things, and units are perceptual. there isn't a unit of truth and not everything is a binary one or the other. the unit is relative to your perception. you define if the sickness or oldness is "you". you are the unit which best fits your form of perception.

I was always surprised to get called by mom to dinner or whatever because as a child, when I was playing the game, I *was* the game. getting called back into "me" felt like a huge jolt.

### 2021-09-23 01:13 - thoughts of where it may have begun

this one is going to need the speculation goggles again. there is so much convoluted information, I simply cannot really ever know for sure. neither does it matter either. my job is just to find a way to feel good no matter the circumstances.

I had some reactions to the beginning part about the conception and birth. I honestly don't know. the best I can figure, I'm one of the "automatons of contrast" that I wanted to create. I don't know where it begun, but tesla talks in 1903 of communicating with mars, and says that he believes conscious life is out there -- then nothing. complete radio silence. I figure he must have got into contact with something. somehow he must have figured out how to communicate with source (not too much different than esther/abraham)

personally, I believe that it's possible to communicate using technology (and other psychic things like remote viewing) with planets, stars, galaxies, the deceased, and even source. it's just tuning and a willingness to communicate on their level rather than trying to bring them down to yours.

I don't know where I originate from or any of that, but it doesn't matter. I imagine a situation where tesla is figuring out how to move around inside of time, and he needs someone he can use to influence timelines. he sets up the conditions and then tunes me into a body and off I go. manipulate the circumstances to adjust my trajectory and it's possible to make a lot of things happen.

what I'm saying is that a lot of the custodial influence could easily have been me. he would just need to incarnate me into a body and give me the conditions necessary to produce the outcome desired.

I don't know if it is or not, but I figure I could have easily have been hitler, constantine, various roman emperors, mystics, etc. a lot of these custodial influences that bramley talks about could easily be me considering how conditional I am. I just optimise for the result I desire, and that can be influenced pretty easily, I imagine.

it seems strange, even to me that I want to make a galaxy so badly. when it comes to my personal development, I can clearly see that I want to feel the freedom to feel *any* way that I want, good or bad, and I can still find my way through it, oozing creativity and novelty because that's a reflection of who I am. just put me in a situation and off I go. I find my way no matter what.

---

what I think is happening is I'm being offloaded here. seems I was used to create an environment capable of needing tesla's creations (you gatta want them) and that was good for me because I expanded a lot in the process.

the semite/atlantian custodians were supplanted by the aryan custodians. I must have been involved with the atlantian custodians, but I don't know to what extent. I likely built a lot of technology and stuff cause I like technology and creativity... the aryans had to supplant the atlantians and make way for the new ones... I'm going to call them the aquarian custodians.

this, I believe is what is happening. the aryans incarnated me into bodies to affect the timeline the way they wanted it to go. now, the baton is being handed to the aquarians. from my perspective, I'm getting too good at feeling the way I want to feel now, so I'm not as useful to play custodial roles because I'm less and less conditional all the time and I'm too difficult to control easily. this is probably why physical stuff doesn't really motivate me much, and I long to return to being creative again.

seems the world system setup is capable of controlling my conditions pretty good, so the aryans are passing me off now to next custodians. they have to find a way to keep me forever in an endless cycle of contrived emotions (like the movies). if I find my connection, their secrets are revealed and everything falls apart, so they have to keep incarnating me into bodies over and over finding more and more difficult circumstances and influences to try and keep distracting me from becoming conscious of who I *really* am.

they want what I have, but never for me to have it too.

---

I guess I'm ready to start any time. I have no idea what all of the constraints are or any of that. I'm going to continue to keep practising my technique. I'm in no rush to get connected. I'm mainly concerned with improvement of my technique.

soiler: we all have a common source and we're only limited by our perception.

disclaimer: this entry is not likely to be accurate. I don't feel very certain about it and there is at least some discomfort. so, speculation is advised.

final disclaimer: not all aryans are custodians. neither are all atlantians/semites custodians. neither are all aquarians custodians. I'm specifically referring to the ones that think they "own" the place, are custodians of the planet, the nanny/babysitter to keep the reckless humans from killing theirselves... etc.


### 2021-09-24 13:27 - initial thoughts on tychos model

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyrNmOmJbEE)
[tychos website](http://www.tychos.info/)
[tychos planetarium](https://codepen.io/pholmq/full/XGPrPd)

I have a number of things to say about it, so I'll try and do so in an orderly fashion...

#### they're committing data fraud, so we're right

beginning to read through the book I can't help but to notice a lot of "they're wrong" (and so we're right) sorts of arguments being made. this is usually a red-flag for me to note custodial activity. it's a common technique that they use to shoot down or sidestep anyone with "unexplained phenonema".

however the idea doea resonate with me so I'm not willing to just dismiss it as another psy-op to obfuscate the truth. after watching an interview with the authors of the theory (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxnH3oPoc3I)), multiple times they try to illustrate how wrong the present capernican model is and it's a bit jaring. any respectible scientist would know how large a change away from a heliocentric model would entail.

they illustrate that observational astronomy does not really exist and numbers are massaged to fit the prevailing idea of how the system works.

I don't disagree. I believe this is the same problem with cimate change. it's very difficult to see any real historical data of temp, wind speed and pressure over time and space. instead, all we have are models of what that data *should* look like. if tony heller is right, even that data is being adjusted to fit the model, too.

this sort of technique to manipulate the data to conform to the image being sold is called marketing and it's being done in governments, power structures, and commerce since the beginning of time. we even commit this same fallacy in every greeting when we tell people things are "good" or "fine". we're trying to convince people of the image that wants to be presented more than the reality. so, no big deal. we all do it to some extent and I don't think this behaviour will ever go away until we turn into robots. all art is based on this principal of making something look another more abstract way.

so, from my perspective, no big deal. fighting the past feels like fighting. that's not what people want to feel when they get the idea. I think this idea needs a rebranding to feel like a whole new world or prerspective is opening up.

I don't think it's necessary to use custodial marketing techniques to sell a good idea.

#### custodial fingerprints

the story of kepler rewriting brache's idea to tell you that once again you are not the centre of your universe, but instead are just the lowest rank in a vast heirarchy above you is such a custodial trope, this whole thing just shouts custodial activity to me.

this is the maverick that has an idea which allows the common person to perceive theirself as separate from the heirarchy, which must be stopped. whether you believe that moses, jesus, martin luther, joseph smith, muhammed, or whomever had an authentic idea that was then manipulated and turned into morals, dogma, and religion... I believe that someone has systematically gone through history and removed as much evidence for people's perception of physical conditions as a means for enlightenment.

I'm kind of in agreement with the custodians and don't really find them to be much of a problem. in a world where things push against other things, it appears they have done massive amounts of damage. however, in a world of attraction, they did not cause any damage at all. they just presented an illusion which people believed and then attracted their own misfortune.

if everything is relative to everything else and there isn't a central axis upon which everything revolves -- as this theory tries to show, which is that everything has at least one strongly interacting companion -- then, that means our perspective of how things are moving is also constantly changing/improving over time because there is no central axis around which truth revolves.

if people were only presented with correct ideas, they would be able to recognise fraud, but that assumes that central axis. instead, it's better to assume that we have to constantly update that concept/perception/model when new data comes in. therefore, it's better to have the agility to rapidly update the concept.

from the custodial perspective, they need people who believe in an absolute truth, because those people can be lead to believe that their truth is the absolute truth. any resistance can be overcome with persistent presentation of an image ("facts") and the passage of generations because the children grow up naievely believing what they're taught is true. the more people that believe their narrative, the more power they have. it doesn't matter the narrative; it just needs to be something that they can control (so they can change it) or predict (so they appear right and credible).

from my perspective, I think none of this matters and is largely a distraction. no one is going to ever gain enlightenment or find happiness with the right climate model or planetarium.

#### earth's perspective

after looking at this model, what it reminds me a lot of is the idea that you can create any (1d) waveform over time with an infinite set of sine waves (which are one axis of a circle). there are also these drawings that show how an infinite set of constantly rotating circles (epicycles) can produce any (2d) curve over time as well (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY4luNgGfms)).

I consider this to be the case for this model. considering these epicycles, modern astronomy is trying to describe the curve with the sun in the centre, while this is trying to take into account as many circles as we can see, and it shows with pretty good accuracy how things appear to be interacting with us from the perspective of our circle.

the way I see it is this chain of circles, but instead of just a 1 to 1 between circles, each circle can have other circles as moons going around them.

we don't really know if we get out far enough that we our solar system cluster is actually the "moon" of another body. it could also be one of those p-orbits.

#### what about comets?

I wondered about this. clearly some comets don't have a circular orbit. thouugh upon further thought, I don't think that everything in the system has a circular orbit. I think that just the things which have a stable resonance (standing wave?) would have these circular orbits. my intuition says that getting a circular orbit likely has to do with the property that the object is producing its own vibrations and is no longer having just a trajectory of its reactions to past interactions.

further inquiry here.

#### interaction with sirius

one of the "problems" with this model is that I believe that we are interacting with sirius, and that perhaps many other stars are too. my intuition also believes that there is a very small (probably planet sized) and very high density third star (sirius c) in the main sirius system.

we don't really know what produces these circles, and I posulate that planets are different to stars in that they have a real geometry to them (like the earth and the chestahedron), whereas a sun is a sphere that produces its geometry from the magnetic interactions between them. planets, I believe go from more dense elements toward the lighter ones (gas giants). this purification process produces a planet that looks and behaves like a sun, but is not a sun. because it has a real geometry to it (y-chromosome), it is sort of like the "driver" to the sun.

I believe that the two main stars which I will call aphrodite (sirius a) and isis (sirius b) also have a driver and that is this super high frequency theird one which I think I'll refer to as menkaure or khnum (sirius c). I'll come back to this.

point is, I believe the composition of the body determines its frequency and geometry. heavier elements usually emit lower frequency and lighter elements emit higher frequencies. density is a product of attraction. a rocky planet does not need to have strong attraction or magnetic field to stay together, but a gas giant, composed mostly of hydrogen, does.

khnum, for example, I believe has (in our concept of gravity) an unbelievably dense composition of very light elements, but still retaining a lot of heavier elements as well, giving him a very broad frequency range of absorption with retransmission in high frequency ranges (like a focal prisim). however isis and aphrodite are much more visible and emit light more suitable to sustain life.

---

our interaction with sirius may be something like a comet, but actually after having given it some thought, I think we may actually be in a p-orbit around the sirius cluster, similar to something like jupiter, saturn or pluto.

more investigation is needed.

#### venus and the moon's effect on the epicycles

if we look at our solar system as epicycles, then the moon appears to be the furthest one out in the system. if we removed the moon from the system, the entire system would behave differently.

in ancient literature, it talks about a time of 360 day years, but the maya actually have a 260 day year, and this could have been the case before we had the moon. the addition of the moon completely changed the dynamics of the entire solar system.

also, it talks of a time when there was only a 360 day year. I wonder if this change have occurred when the sun captured venus as one of its moons.

#### dance with mars

the second "problem" with this model is with my desire to couple ourselves to mars.

I don't really see it as a problem though. if mars is the driver for the sun, then the driver for earth is the moon.

the other thing I believe is that earth is going through a transition where it's going to begin to shed a lot of its higher density elements and we'll turn into something that resembles something more like the sun does. it's actually my belief that it'll be pretty similar to my description of sirius c (khnum).

so, now we come back to the triads. consider that the earth to be the female (isis 2.0) with just a single planet as the driver (moon), the earth will need a second driver. I propose this to be mars.

because we don't really understand attraction, it's hard for us to model and predict these epicycles, but I have to wonder what it would look like if the earth were to have two moons: mars and the moon. mars and the moon would rotate around us like mercury and venus orbit the sun.

that idea kind of goes in contrary to the mushroom galaxy idea

#### triads

it occurred to me that triads may be the norm. we see them as "binaries" because they are nurturing somethingt in the centre. so, imagine that sun and mars are a married couple and earth is the child. mars appears like a "bad father" destroying himself during earth's childhood. earth then has to grow up without a father (or abusive oppressive father, depending on what myths you subscribe to).

the growth cycle of the planet is to grow up and eventually shed most of its heavier elements and become a strong attractor on his own. if the hold the child in the centre, once the planet has become a strong attractor on his own, then when the female sun gives birth to a new dense planet, he can catch it and hold it while it matures. from the parent planet's perspective, it appears like his job is to counteract all of the outside influences such that to the child planet, it appears to be the centre of its universe.

wow, this model has completely opened a whole new perception of stellar activity for me... so cool!!

### 2021-09-25 23:49 - shedding of concrete reality

lately I have noticed that I have had a bit more of a difficult time holding this sort of ordered reality -- as in, I used to queue up a bunch of tasks for myself and then I could execute them, like I would remind myself to take something upstairs next time I go up, and that reminder would trigger when I was going to go upstairs. I imagine that hearthstone players use these sorts of triggers when they're playing to check for all of the possibilites that the opponent could be doing. you know, like "lol order" things.

thing is, I get so focused into what I'm thinking about, that it's very hard to feel those reminders anymore. as a result, because I want to still have a feelingt of order in my life, I have to continue to find ways of lowering the intensity of my thoughts. I use humour to stay light-hearted but it's not as effective because there needs to be something to laugh about.

in general, I would say that all of my memory faculties are also diminishing as well. seems I mostly only have problems remembering things that are not really that important. they may have seemed important, but they're not. like, I was just watching a documentary on pompei and he showed a picture of isis with a crocodile under her feet. there's another god that also has a crocodile under their feet too, but I can't remember who. the only thing I can remember is that it was associated with the period of time when I believe we went from scorpio to taurus and then the sun was then put on top of the bull (or hathor).

point is, I normally would have been able to remember those sorts of details very easily, however they feel like they're there in essence but the physical details that constructed that concept are not hanging around.

slightly related, I noticed how terrible/different I felt after opening up my email and seeing the abraham now broadcast notifications and the howtube response... those feel like ancient history to me at this point -- a very long time ago -- and, returning to remember them did not feel so good. had I not have opened my email, I wouldn't have tuned into the past with those physical details.

what appears to be happening is, my memory is being hyper consolidated into abstract versions. if I look at something from my past, then it's sort of like it transports me back there a moment.. I actually think that the incredible progress that I have been making the last few months has actually been because I *didn't* have a computer.

one day I was explaining to dad what it's like with the analogy that many people are staring at the forest through a window rather than walking through it. neither am I walking though it, but most people are so busy complaining about the spots on the window, they don't even see the beautiful forest out there. other people are admiring the forest and observing it. I don't really see all the minute and beautiful details, instead I seem to perceive it in a way which it looks to me like I understand how the forest works. I see processes, cycles, trends, species, and archetypes. stuff like that.

as a correlary to this consider the relationship between meaning and concept. if I start with a concept like "beautiful car", that can have many incarnations of that concept with various implementation details which would be described as a "beautiful car". likewise, if I were to look at a number of different cars, I could identify certain details as imparting the car with the concept of "beautiful".

consider that second example in everyday life and notice that certain details of someone's behaviour or appearance will imply something. I consider these implications to be "meaning". when observing carefully, one will notice that these details are also themselves concepts. a collection of concepts means something.

---

there were considerable number of reactions to something I said in my last entry about the alchemical process of a planet sheding its higher density elements and the implication that this is what I think is also beginning to happen here on earth.

I don't pretend to know what the physical manifestation of this is, but what I do know is that the process for the human is where reality starts to become a dream-like state where reality is a reflection of how you feel. all "matter" is no longer as dense in that state of being as it is in this physical space. what I mean is, if I feel a bar of gold (a very dense material) in my hand, it's there. then, as soon as I feel it as iron, it turns to iron.

if one were to take the gold bar from my hand, it would be gold -- like the same stuff that comes out of the ground. the structure is the same, but it took on that form effortlessly.

science does not make the claim, but I will... the sun is producing massive amounts of all of the elements from nothing more than the lighest element we know of, hydrogen and magnetic fields.

so, what's the difference between the sun's gold and my mental gold? energetic inertia. the look the same, behave the same and for all practical purposes are the same. the sun's gold has been a long time in the making, while my mental gold only maintains it's structure for as long as I can feel it there.

---

so, does that mean that I think that out entire reality will become completely temporary and unstable? not at all. if I had to guess, our reality will look and feel exactly like we believe it to be, which is looking like earth does, however the concept that we have of those physical details will start to become a bit slippery.

my guess is that we will maintain all things that are important to us. so, for example, if I have the idea that I have beautiful skin, that skin can perhaps be any colour to anyone, as long as it conforms to the concept of beautful skin. I do wonder if DNA sequences would vary for the same cell, requiring the sequence to conform to the perception of those performing the test. lots of interesting things can be tested there.

what I'm trying to say is that in our form of perception, it will look like earth does with oceans, mountains, jungles and animals, but to those that do not maintain the same form of perception as we do, it'll look like a chaotic ball of hydrogen. simply put, those hydrogen elements only assimilate a reality resonant with our perception.

lol, yes, there could be entire places that exist here on earth that we simply don't see because we don't resonate with that reality. places like skinwalker ranch may be those types of places, actually.

---

the idea is actually very exciting for me. normally, I would be kind of concerned that my focus is now so strong that it's getting difficult to remember mundane reminders I have for myself, but I'm realising that this magnetic reality is beginning to become difficult to avoid maintaining my focus on it, this is simply the beggining of the transition into a fully mentalised reality becoming persistent.

I believe the transition of this planet is somewhat inevitable. there are a few things I also would also like to take a look at. first, energy will continue to rise. I believe this has to do with the magnetic field. not all magnetic fields are created equally though. the oscillating magnetic field of an electromagnet is different from a non-oscillating magnetic field like a permanent magnet. the earth's magnetic field is relatively weak, but I believe it oscillates at a number of higher frequencies in addition to the day/night cycle oscillations. I also belive these oscillations are characteristic of the physical manifestation of emotions, and is the reason why different places on earth "feel" different.

as the magnetic field continues to increase, emotion will continue to increase in intensity as well. this may have some pretty intense effects. I believe nosebook is trying to minimise some of these effects turning into manifestations, but it's sort of inevitable that this will continue to increase. I think that the safe bet for those that want to have a strong magnetic field, but not too strong may find mars to be a pretty safe place.

---

actually, this topic actually kind of answered one of my own questions about how people, plants and animals managed to survive various past cataclysms. imagine that the sun sends out a massive amount of hydrogen out and it hits the earth's magnetic field. the magnetic field of earth will reverberate resonant with the consciousness of earth. during the impact, the earth will be in a very energetic state with an extremely high induced magnetic field from the impact.

all consciousness that is resonant with the consciousness of the earth will find theirselves in an environment that I claim will be similar to the one that the earth will soon have where the environment is more and more filled with protons and the reality all consciousness experiences (plants, animals, and insects alike) all becomes a reflection of their vibration. those that are thriving, continue to do so, and those that feel they are in danger, are in fact in danger. some believe they need to survive and so they experience a reality that they need to survive.

gradually as energies begin to lower down again, these realities begin to coalesce into something meaningful again -- as the frequencies of each version of reality begin to merge, it takes the path chosen.

so, like for example if someone walks into the room super pissed off and I never even notice that they're there or any of the pissed-offness, then my version of reality is dominant, and they live in my reality rather than me living in theirs.

imagine two people are both in the rockies and one experienced an enlightenment experience and constructed a beautiful castle, while the other barely survived the bitter cold. they both occupy the same physical place, so they are incompatible realities. as they begin to merge, the castle guy may start to feel more like the bitter cold reality. if he continues to feel good and doesn't experience that reality, his reality will win. the guy in the bitter cold will not survive. if he begins to feel the bitter cold, somehow their realities will begin to merge where they both find theirselves in a bitter cold reality with each other -- or maybe just the bitter cold guy survives because castle guy wasn't prepared for the bitter cold.

this whole thing seems to be a story of incompatible realities. I feel like that answered a lot of the reactions.

### 2021-09-26 16:53 - a bit more on incompatible realities

I had a weird morning of dreams, which I can't really remember now, but it seems that my explanation of hydrogen being organised mentally into a structure seemed to make a lot of sense to people.

there were some significant concerns that earth would no longer be compatible perceptively with us, and they would no longer be able to control or interact with us, given the incompatibilites between our realities.

there were also concerns that following the nova event, there would be a lot of places on earth that would have incompatible realities for them, preventing them from surviving.

---

well, that's not at all what I was getting at. I assumed that the martians would continue to transfer their consciousness into bodies that we produce, thereby continuing to perceive and interact with us. in that sense, they have to keep up with us. from their perspective, it looks like they're controlling and taking advantage of us, while reusing our perception for their own uses -- so, sorta like what's happening to me now.

I wrote that because it provided an explanation for so many things ranging from bases inside of mountains that can only be perceived when in an altered state of consciousness, the way that things can be materialised mentally, what's really happeing on gas giants, and potentially what is happening with the p-orbit planets interaction with our sun -- and how these different competing reality influences on the sun creates our solar storms and how that ties into LOA for us as a species on this planet through perception. as I feel more and more comfortable with the topics, I'll write about them. I still feel like I'm only perceiving the top of the iceburg there.

the other thing that I was assuming to be true is a bit messed up. just like me, I'm certain that there is a whole nother reality out there that I simply don't see. what I was implying is that our reality is liquid because any set of concepts could mean anything and a meaning can be implemented with any set of concepts[^1], and the martians would actually be collapsing that "wave function" for us, getting allowing us to perceive, not the real reality but the reality that they want us to perceive (exactly like me right now).

---

anyway, I went back to sleep and I woke up with this weird feeling, though it didn't feel bad, that they wanted to transfer my consciousness into jackson's body when he's born. I'm sorta OK with it. it would solve a lot of their problems because I think I'm responsible for quite a considerable amount of the the strengthening of the magnetic field here on earth.

when I was decribing the high frequency vibrating magnetic field as a product of emotions (which may be why we have magnetic field sensing gut bacteria), I began to notice that the aura that I have around me is what makes expanded vision possible. the few times that I got to see it, I was very surprised to notice that reality feels alive vibrating in a way which feels a lot like how I feel (they suppress the manifestation of how I really feel inside of my body). therefore, this high-frequency magnetic field is something that I am constantly emaniating.

the other thing I noticed just now is that although the sun is in b range for x-ray flux, the sun feels very hot outside like it normally does when there is a flare (yes I know TSI goes down during a flare; I'm talking about how prickly the sun feels). I also notice this happens when there is a geomagnetic storm too. therefore, it seems to me that the stingyness must be associated with magnetic fields, which is what I'm producing more and more of.

I am certain that the magnetic field was much stronger back before the younger dryas, but it's said that it was nice and people didn't need to wear clothes to be warm. following my discussion of incompatible realities, I think the reason for these cataclysmic events is because there are incompatible realities, and the sun is pushing reality creation to the extreme with the addition of many extra protons. that means that mental reality is created really quickly causing conflict between incompatible realities to accelerate.

well, this I believe is what is happening with the way that they're interfering with the electricity in my body is somehow (not sure yet) making the excessive heat. a conductor with a changing magnetic field creates heat (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7Rg0TcHQ4Y)). the other thing to look at is to see if destructive intereference produces a magnetic field. [a quick search](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-left-Constructive-interference-of-electric-fields-yields-destructive-interference-of_fig1_265849380) suggests that, "Destructive interference of electric fields yields constructive interference of magnetic fields and a virtual open." -- so maybe.. dunno.

what I mean is, it's actually these incompatible realities that produce this heat and the p-orbit planets (neptune, saturn, jupiter, pluto) all having incompatible realities are actually what is producing the heat on the sun. what I mean is, the temperature of the sun may actually directly correlate to how many incompatible realities are magnetically affecting the protons in the sun.

this is why I say that the girls thing likely will never happen until there is a physical or temporal separation between these incompatible realities.

"global warming" (and the heat damage on various megaliths) I postulate is the manifestation of incompatible realities (magnetic fields) interacting in an environment with a lot of protons floating around.

---

I don't really mind that they want to move my consciousness over to another body. it would buy them a lot of time if that decreases the magnetic field by a significant amount. however, it doesn't really make for much of a long-term solution though. for that, I am really beginning to believe that the only way to slow this down will actually be to make a spatial separation. that really is the best option that I can see, and it's the one that makes the most sense too. I also noted that moons seem to be designed to destructively interefere with the parent body to slow down their rotation rate, not to speed it up.

anyway.. a few more ideas

[1]: which is, btw the beginning of the "thrust" layer that I'm wanting to add as a precursor to desire.

### 2021-09-27 15:22 - thinking more on the transition

so, after I wrote yesterday's entry I went to watch stars and other things, and the reality is I don't at all feel bad about the idea of making my transition into jackson's body. there's a definite part of me that likes the idea of starting over again.

the way I see it, there are only 3 possible outcomes: none, some, or all. since they definitely don't want "all", and I didn't really have any resistance to "some" before going to becky's house, so if that were going to happen, it would have. I had decreased enough resistance that it could have happened the following day. though it didn't cause I think things were rearranged so they had a birthday party to attend to. the final option is "none" which I'm also fine with.

I actually prefer "all" or "none" rather than "some" mainly because my body is not operating very well. if it's all, then I have power over my appearance and my body so I can take on any shape I desire. if it's none, then I don't have to worry about all of the stress associated with trying to get my body to perform in a way it doesn't want to perform. in that sense, I'd rather just be born disabled and grow up never realising that my body isn't operating at full capability.

the other thing I like about none is that I'm starting to get the sense that "none" will be quite a lenthy thing. there is this part in the epic of gilgamesh that after gilgamesh puts on lion skins to mourn the death of his friend enkidu (this is referring to a cataclysm where east and west swap again so now we're in leo instead of aquarius), which is sort of the beginning of the 12 labours of heracles. he has to fight this hydra. the hydra has many heads, and each time he chops off the one of the heads, two grow back. this is like the story of job, when YHVH takes everything away from job, but because job was able to continue on, he got double in return.

this is sort of like the way I see myself with this. they'll have to keep transferring me into a new body over and over to try and keep their thing charade going, but each time I'll get better and better at remembering who I really am. sure, they may be able to cut off one of my heads now, but two more will grow back in place of the last. each time it'll get harder and harder for them to keep me away from my connection to that infinite knowledge.

I really don't have much of a difficulty with it because I'm noticing now that it doesn't really matter what my conditions are and what I'm taught, because I have an internal guidance system. in fact, I noticed that even if I'm fed bad ideas, lousy science, and all other matter of disengenuine ideas, that no matter what, I can figure out the way toward the ideas that feel good. I just desire to improve my understanding of the thing (rather than prove myself right) and stuff just starts to show up. from that perspective, there is no need to preserve knowledge because it's all there right now -- just, for whatever reason, I'm not tuned to it right now.

therefore, from that perspective, it's not about knowledge, it's about capacity to tune and reduction of resistance to the thing I want to know. none of the conditions matter, just my ability to feel the way I want to feel (that is, tune to it).

furthermore, considering that this game is optimising for error correction and recovery, I would imagine that each iteration they'll try and make sure I'm lead to believe a lot of bogus ideas. the better I get at seeing through the crap, the more and more resiliant I become. I'm actually certain that's kind of what is what I'm going to come out of this able to do.

I like to consider this transition the first trial run, which will then be optimised further, because as I mentioned, this will eventually become a game we are all playing -- the one where you're only fighting yourself -- your dual.

it's sorta annoying to have to start over, but I should get used to it, as it'll start to happen more and more. however, I am glad that in order to finally beat the game, I have to become completely unstoppable.

who knows, maybe when that happens, I'll figure out another way to delay it further... it seems that the more one delays the manifestation, the bigger and more impossible it is to resist. like I said, things go well, I'll find a way to go infinite...

---

there was one idea that popped into my head when I was waking up which came into mind which may add on pretty good to the disaster...

after making my transition to jackson's body, if girls seem to allow me to find my connection easily, they'll obviously determine that I cannot be around girls, and so therefore each iteration, they'll have to likely try and force me to be gay so I'll never associate with girls.

if I'm following my emotions, and the men don't feel good, I'll naturally gravitate away from them, meaning that in general I'll be away from people that don't feel good, regardless of gender. eventually, even good feeling men won't be allowed anymore, I'm sure, so I'll be back to figuring it out for myself again.

I think my capacity to go about things as an individual will reach a new height, meaning I'm basically imposible to control. this will likely cause another reversal (probably toward strong women), but that'll be perceived as unwanted again so another reversal. now they'll have to use the influence strong women have over me again and likely use me to find a way to produce their own "pandora" to influence me back into the group thinging again.

I'm certain that by then they'll *finally* figure out that they cannot fight against things. I think they'l probably try the next technique of dilution after that to try and get rid of me. you can't ever divide enough times to get to zero. then, the most tinyest part of me will be the most attractive thing ever.

they will have inadvertantly created a game which will produce as many sirius c types as wish to participate and lots and lots of beautiful stars along the way, too.

no big deal from my perspective. it looks like I had only been looking at the things as present, but they still need more things to line up for them to manifest.

### 2021-09-27 16:48 - going infinite

I thought I would properly define what I mean by going infinite.

whenver something manifests it has an amount of desired and undesired properties to it (relative to the perceiver).

undesired also contains desired, just with a different perception.

therefore, if we imagine a manifestation of mostly desired, there is equal amounts of undesired but most people perceive the desirable part.

likewise, a manifestation of mostly undesired aspects, there is an equal amount of desired, but most people perceive the undesired parts.

therefore, the most expansive manifestations have the most undesired, because they can be perceived as desired.

so, to keep accelerating, each manifestation needs to have maximum undesired and then find a way to perceive the undesired as desirable (see previous entry as an example).

---

the idea of going infinite is that the "big (desirable) manifestation" never happens. instead only incremental least desirable manifestations are allowed to occur.

the idea is that there needs to be created such a strong oppressive force capable of preventing the most desirable manifestation from ever happening. instead, from their perspective they have to continually allow things when they feel they have no other option than to allow it.

---

if this can be kept up forever, this is what I call "going infinite" and is what I intend to create.

### 2021-09-28 23:55 - twin towers

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZuK72eQGwA)

I have long been fascinated with the number 11, and I remember disliking that so many terrorist events had the number 11 asociated with them, most notably the 9-11 event. anyway, I decided I would continue to like the number even still.

as I was watching the video on the triptych symbols the many architects continued to use, I couldn't help but to notice a that the twin towers were a reference to the builders of solomon's temple.

the name, "world trade center" is giving the illusion that new york is the centre for all world trade -- perhaps a bit of a departure from the previously established london as the centre of the world and prime meridian.

the twin towers represent joakim and boaz which are a common theme of the two masculine and feminine sides in the physical, however when these two I's are united, the central (third) eye is enlightened.

---

I remembered a clip I saw a few weeks ago from a video linked on david mathisson's site...

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/M26-B44qQIs?t=69)

69 seconds into that clip, the reporter says:

> as you can see behind me the trade center appears to be still burning.
> we see these huge clouds of smoke and ash [...]
> a symbol of the financial prosperity of this city but completely disappeared now [...]
> presumably there were very few people in the salomon building when it collapsed

---

the "smoking gun" that 9-11 was an inside job was building 7 free-falling after having had no apparent damage. the reporter calls it the "salomon building" and states the symbolism just to be sure we know that we're talking about something symbolic... meanwhile the building she is claiming to have fallen is still standing up right behind her.

seeing that the previous financial centre of the world is london, and this is the bbc with the prefab news, this must paint a pretty good motive for british money to have motivated this event.

---

to further complicate the thing, it appears to have been pulled off by hollywood, complete with the massive fireball as the plane crashes into the building (planes don't explode like that). then, I also heard that the insurance for the building paid for the whole thing and the owner of the building cashed in on a heavily deteriorated buildings receiving much more from the insurance than the building could have sold for. so, the famous, "follow the money" feels pretty hopeless and murky to uncover anything substantial. the event is clearly symbolic.

that video talks about how the roman church decided in the 1700's to stop employing the freemasons to build their cathedrals. we also know that the roman church gave the "alhambra decree" that jews needed to convert to christianity or go away. they instead looked to make a new life in the americas (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0Kfp2-Lqh4)). sepehr makes the suggestion that the phonecians were essentially forced to move to the americas by the church and they brought their whole operation with them (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/9b7bbY9VGuM?t=507)).

a large number of the founding fathers were masons and knew of this esoteric teaching of opening the third eye with the balance of male and female. the world trade center must then be interpretted as a perversion of this ancient teaching and establishing an economic structure on top of this ancient teaching.

this has to be a symbolic thing. what keeps happening (remember LOA and what to expect), that this ancient phonecian culture keeps getting displaced, and a number of symbols regarding the "end times" are associated with empires which had displaced these "red ones".

so, sepehr doesn't ever really say it explicitly, but reading between the lines, it sounds to me like he's basically linking the cro magnon humans to the atlantians, which after the destruction of the atlantian empire, they became the phonecians. these are the "atlantian root race" that blavatski talks about, and also explains why there is such a coverup around everything mars, giants, and vibration technology related.

---

after the last few weeks I've begun to think that 9-11 *wasn't* an inside job. in fact, I think they're clueless about it. I remember one time when I was in la vera and someone really wanted to know what I thought of 9-11. I certainly said that I thought that I am certain that the buildings disappeared with tesla technology. I don't know if I said back then that I thought that no one died in the event -- but I do remember getting a lot of reactions on that for quite a while.

the other day at becky's house I mentioned in passing to a guy that I don't think they even know what happened either. I made the correlation to science, where they'd rather make something up than to say they don't know.

I don't think they knew, perhaps until just recently that it too, like the "ufo phenomenon" did not really understand that it was all LOA stuff.

---

imagine for a moment the following scenario:

a building which symbolises the financial super power of the phonecians in the americas falls down. the news telling of the collapse of the "salomon brothers building" appears to have been fabricated, so whoever did it controls the news and can get the reporter to say whatever they're told to say, regardless that the evidence of the untruth they're saying is in plain sight.

they notice numbers, so the sheer amount of 11s will certainly jump out, along with the buildings being symbolic of the two pillars, the anomalies almost certainly are stacking up. they find out that there are no fatalities in the entire incident. basically, they have no idea how an entire structure could disappear in such a spectacular fashion without anyone dying (from the incident itself).

it certainly appears like a terrorist attack, but they don't know what's going on. how could it be terrorists if no one died? how do they know no one died? how could something so catastrophic like that happen with just planning? it would appear that those responsible can edit timelines, but that's supposedly impossible. there's no way anyone would believe that a timeline editing group with capability, complete with governments news and media under their control would go to such lengths to frame them by making it appear like an inside job. no one would ever beilive that.

it really would sound weird telling people that it was a spectacular terrorist attack without any casualties, so in harmony with the bogus story about building 7, they have to now begin to make up news. they pay a whole bunch of actors to say that they had family die in the attack. everyone knew someone that died in the attack, so it creates the illusion that people must have died. I don't know if the people jumping out of the window was an added effect later or part of the original illusion, but it sure would put the stakes up pretty high to force them to make up other fatalities.

"wait, people will just believe manufactured news?" they said... so, instead of telling the whole world that they have no idea what happened, they sieze the opportunity to begin fabricating news stories to support their agenda. we need a memorial, lots of patriotism and to teach these terrorists who the real world power is.

---

this event ushers in the new era of just completely manufacturing news. I think they were doing it a little beforehand, but since people were falling for it so hard, I think this is when news started to become much more sensational, telling people what to think.

the 9-11 event so dramatically altered the course of history. it happened at a time when the internet was beginning to take off, and certainly the internet would have obsoleted many financial and communication control points.

from their perspective, it would have been a super great opportunity to regain control over things that they were losing their grip on. I think this was done on purpose.

they know what I'm talking about.

---

however much of an illusion is present on the surface, there is this sinister undertone of these different forces displacing the atlantians/phonecians/jews constantly removing them from their land or position of power. each time it happens, they (the martians) transform into a new form. this force seems to be difficult to identify where exactly it is coming from because I will argue that the force is a reflection of their perception.

these events and the ufo phenomena in general illustrates nothing more than than their own perception. things like there is this force out there trying to get them and tell them what to do, yet that is what they are attempting to do.

they wish to be an unseen force that manipulates and controls from up on high, and these sorts of events reveal only make them believe that they are also being manipulated from up on high by an invisible force that has an agenda for them.

reality will always reflect how you feel. so, like if you feel you need to manipulate and control people to not be the one manipulated and controlled, LOA will always find a way to ensure that you experience a reality that amplifies the feeling of being manipulated and controlled, and so therefore create a desire to manipulate and control, so as to not be manipulated and controlled.

obviously, at any time one can change what frequency they're tuned into, but there's nothing I can do to make anyone choose to tune into something desired. if you belive everyone is out to take advantage of you, LOA will ensure that feeling will continue to become more.

---

from my perspective, that feeling is benficial, because it creates a strong desire to create more and more technology, and I like creating things. if someone wants to rely on technology to create the conditions that they want, I can channel that desire into reality. 

there are other people that believe that people who desire to to control can control them, and again I have the same perspective. more excuses (desire manifest as fear) for me to make technology for them to be controlled by.

usually, those two types of people are swapping places endlessly.

or, they're the same person.

### 2021-09-29 17:33 - the golden rule is stupid

this afternoon when waking up, I was monologuing a bit. I grew up with this idea that I should treat other people like I want to be treated. if it wasn't that, I would treat them how I treat myself.

the major problem with treating people like I treat myself is that I'm very critical and hold myself to a very high standard. most people can't handle critisim and do not really have many goals or aspirations, and if they do, they seem to try and put in the minimal don't have high standards, willing to accept whatever they're given. so, I don't people like I treat myself.

the major problem I started to notice early on is that when I treat people like I want to be treated, again that causes huge problem. I *want* people give me their most well thought out answer when I ask a question -- so, that's what I do. I also want people to say they don't know if they don't know -- so, I do that too.

I found out that those sorts of answers are not what people wanted though. they wanted me to tell them what they wanted me to say (eg. what they want to hear). I have no idea what they want to hear. I was extremely bad at that for a long time, but then I used my ability to feel to my advantage.

if I take an idea, I can present it in my mind and feel its resonance with me. I also noticed that I can present an idea to another person (in my mind) and feel the resonance of that idea with that person. this allowed me to very easily get a sense of what they want to hear from me. I practised this a lot mostly drunk in spain, but I got pretty good at it.

---

getting good at telling people what they want to hear, I noticed is something very prevalent in spanish culture. I noticed everyone was running around with two competing narratives coming out of their mouth. the first was the image they were trying to present to people (I'm tough. I'm strong. I'm sensual. etc.) and also the narrative of telling the other person what they want to hear. sometimes these two narratives matched and sometimes they didn't.

there's this image that remains with me but I don't know where I saw it. it's of a really tough guy that is trying to tell a girl what she wants to hear, but it conflicts with his tough image. the other one is a guy that is also tough and stuff but he has te pretend like he's wounded to catch a break from the judge (just like in futbol). there are many other examples of this with kids and their moms or girlfriends.

it's a miserable place to try and constantly adjust what I have to say to fit what the person wants to hear. I recognise now that the pressure was even greater because I was being broadcasted without knowing it, which greatly sped up the process, but I really wanted to just say what I wanted to say, without having to try and lie or make something up to fit what they want to hear.

---

there is this other super big problem in spain (it may be quite prevalent in other mediterranean countries too, italy, turkey, greece, etc.) is that girls expect men to tell them what to do, but *only* when it's something they want to do. if it's not something they don't want to do, then men are punished for trying to coerce/manipulate them into doing something they don't want to do. don't get me wrong, it's sorta a reasonable reaction because dudes spend the majority of their time trying to figure out how to manipulate their words and image to influence others to their desire.

I don't want anything to do with this world. I don't want to tell anyone what to do. I enjoy collaboration, but the moment I start to have an agenda for someone other than myself, things go very wrong.

from what I can tell, I think this sort of behaviour is again an obvious reaction to thing. there must have been countless examples of girls going out, thinking a guy is super great, but her father or mother, maybe both don't think he's a good guy, so not only are they already looking for (and therefore attracting) the worst in her new boyfriend -- then when things fall apart, the parent is then proven to have razon. vindicated in their righeousness, they tell her never to follow her instinct and wait for someone (who appears knowledgeable) to allow her to do what she wants to do.

obviously, this falls apart on so many levels. even if she's able to figure out how to do what she wants, she still is batling the expectation (fear and belief) of her parents of the awfulness of the guy.

this isn't the case for everyone obviously, but I did find it very strange that in spain people need to be told to do the things they want to do. the church and patriarchical society in general may have played a huge role in that. this video makes that suggestion.

there's more I want to say, but for now good luck.

### 2021-09-30 01:02 - enki's trick (part one)

I woke up just now thinking about my previous entry. I realised that a possible trick had occurred and it was recorded in the legend as "pandora's box".

I'll explain the idea as if it's true. the video claims that there was a huge falling out between the gods, forming two factions -- those that wanted to control and ensure the inferiority of the human creation and those who wanted the humans to grow up to be an improvement on theirselves.

quick backstory: the idea is that the annunaki were stationed on mars, which has a different set of conditions than earth here. a lot of the things that the martians had, they brought to earth and these were the atlantians. this civilisation thrived and flourished, however as plato says, the gods lost a lot of their godlike capabilities, becoming more and more animal-like.

the atlantians thrived and flourished. the elite had knowledge of mental manipulation of energy, like fire and shapeshifting, and the energetic structures they built amplified energy higher and higher all the time producing a more and more incompatible reality.

the story of apep (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/TR5FrWiTzZo?t=364)), I think is a thinly veiled reference to the 12ky cataclysms. sometimes the dragon would catch the sun and sometimes it wouldn't. sometimes the thoth (set) would save the sun and sometimes not.

these periodic cataclysms must have happened on a pretty regular basis for the previous 100ky or so. I think the division that occurred between the two factions, and the resulting incompatible reality is the cause for these cataclysms. roughly speaking, think of it like enki wants to go right and enlil wants to go left. things continue to build up until there is a cataclysm and enlil wins.

I think enki keeps letting enlil win because it's not really a problem, considering that we're all eternal beings anyway. each time, a way is provided for some humans to survive.

---

we don't really know if enlil and enki have a common source. I suspect that they do, and are just two sides of the same coin: one creative and one destructive. humans are caught in the middle of this endless war, resulting that weak humans and humans that do not wish to know about their built in connection to source are constantly are culled. personally, consider this whole thing to be a giant eugenics program.

if you believe kuthumi's "extraterrestrial view on creation", and the bit about the channeled sirian triads, it would appear as if this malevalent force is something of a virus that is plaguing the universe since the beginning. I don't know how much I believe that. consider that we're dealing with some pretty good story tellers. the most likely is that is the easiest way to explain a genetic algorithm culling the weak before they're conscious enough to no longer perceive good and bad.

there is another brilliant feature to this kind of narrative, is that the malevalent characters eventually destroy theirselves, it's like the shell of the cosmic egg. the creature inside has to find its way out of the egg to gain the strength. the ones that cannot get out never make it out into the wild.

the self-destruction of the malevalent force is automatic because the creation will inevitably begin to realise its own capability, and to the controlling types, this appears very unwanted. as they continue to perceive unwanted, their reality will reflect more and more unwanted things will manifest. this will continue until their own perception of unwanted destroys themself.

---

back to the story: this battle of the two factions has a cost and that is perception of unwanted. each cataclysm must have been more and more spectacular. if things go altered, this next one will make the younger dryas look like childplay. over the last 100-1000ky this perception of unwanted must have manifested in many ways, with things stedily getting worse, but the most predominiate one was that mars continued to lose its atmosphere, thereby forcing enlil and his goons to earth.

after the younger dryas happened, there was a period where matriarchical society allowed humans to regain once again a lot of their capabilities. it's around this time that pandora's box was released on earth. it was likely a genetic upgrade for women that had some drastic changes on society and created a universal system, where perception was stored in the x-chromosome and that expanded perception was accomplished from the female bloodline. women became the method by which ordinary men could attain godlike capabilities and immortality (no radical change in perception upon death and the ability to easily "walk-in" to another body).

anyway, that all came to an abrupt somewhere at the end of the upper 5-8kya[^1][^2] when I think most of mars' were forced to relocate to earth.

this is where the stories of the dragons start. if you consider that the dragon is the reptilian god form (whether they had copper based blood or not, I dunno), but to me this is referring to the quality of perception. they operate from the "reptilian brain" the one that is instinctual. I am a very good example of a person that perceives through their reptile brain. I follow my instinct.

this form of perception is quite advantageous if you have a preception that feels good. your instinct will lead you naturally to more and more things similar to how you feel.

back when things felt good, this created a sort of universal bliss. it doesn't allow for much control over what is happening, so above the reptile is the mammalian brain. this is herd mentality. science says hunter/gatherer, but I believe that is a wrong image as I think that after the cataclysm, the earth did not produce nearly as abundantly as it did, so people learned to live with and follow the animals.

the matriarchical society provided the perception to be more at one with nature and the animals, which provided the food. that all came to an end with the arrival of the annunaki and their grains which is the foundation of society we live in today (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/yGN-pPBznpY)).

---

since the reptile instinct is driven by how one feels, it is imperative that one has a source of good feeling. consider that dragons are another name for the annunaki coming from mars and that it's a bloodline that offers easy access to that instinctual component of the brain. in order for that insinct to work properly, they need to feel good, and also have a propensity to use young girls as a means to feel good.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR5FrWiTzZo)

most people are herded like a bunch of mammals, and perceive life as a series of reactions to circumstance. they operate from the mamallian brain and are directed with social pressures and other social cues. the last thing they want is for people to begin to make their own decisions (neo cortex) or to get back to instinctual perception while at the same time feeling good. if you are insinctual, they want your instinct to be performed from a place of not feeling good.

---

ok, now on to the trick. I believe that the trick is a very simple one. make these dragons have an insatiable desire women, while at the same time make it so that sex with women increase the intensity of how one feels, while at the same time providing temporary physical pleasure. the physical pleasure eventually goes away and one feels stronger than they used to. when the physical pleasure goes away, they need more.

essentially, girls were the first addiction. they had to have it to maintain their draconic perception (draconic just means clear vision (TODO: find ref)).

what this eventually lead to is a reliance on the x-chromosome bloodline to cancel out the bad-feeling perception.

that's the back-story. I'll try and tackle how that relates to the amplification of feelings of control, and what I believe the next trick is, moving forward into x3 land.

### 2021-10-01 00:58 - lion man or aquarian man?

I'm going full free-form on this one. a lot of seemingly unrelated topics.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Ng6V6WWog)

this morning I woke up and I had this strange sense sort of repeat of one of a dream that I had a long time ago called, "adam and eve's dream". in it, most all of the major players had left earth. presumably, they went to mars and they were looking down on us and using us as a sort of breeding program. it felt to me like the earth had become a pretty energetic place and they didn't want to be here.

---

a bit ago I outlined a plan where I explained that the cataclysm was caused by incompatible realities, and that a split *must* occur, either spatially or temporally.

upon my discovery of the tychos solar system model, I also postulated the idea that mars could become earth's second moon. we would first join mars in its orbit then mars would begin to orbit the earth like the moon does. I don't have enough information to comment further on that one.

I also had another idea that earth could swap places with mars, and put mars where our moon is now and put the moon where earth is now -- the idea being that the moon would become our "child", much like the earth is to mars and the sun.

---

after watching the video with robert talking about heart/brain consciousness, I had some confusion because he talked about seeing the cow and bull symbols in the kings chamber with 5d eyes. 5d is when you perceive the thing from all angles all around it at once. like, imagine you were looking at all sides of the earth from the perspective of the ionosphere.

he must mean 4d eyes. I was watching another presentation with billy carson where he mentioned a few times that the image on his computer is clear and higher detail than the one on the projector (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/SYQUyMPY3S0?t=1129)). I think I know what is happening. it's the same thing and the reason why I can't see the bull and cow. they're likely using my form of perception. the way it works is the image just serves as a tuning device to get them to tune into that moment in time from that perspective. it's like remote viewing in real-time, and allows for much higher quality images because you're tuning into the moment itself rather than looking at the pixels.

if they developed that capacity further, they could tune into and look at anything they wanted to anywhere and anyplace in time. I obviously don't have that capability, but I just wanted to clarify that the ability to see more detail is a tuning to another space and time. if they were seeing in 5d, the whole entire structure would appear at once before them and they could see as many aspects of it that they wanted to look at, all at the same time.

while I'm on the subject, 5d is not just seeing yourself from outside of your body. it's seeing yourself from all of the angles that you want to see yourself at the same time. you can also look outside of your body in as many angles as you want, as well -- just like the sun does. in fact your consciousness can be anywhere inside of the solar system looking inwardly or outwardly at whatever directions you want. it's only you that defines the things (concepts) you're looking at and where they begin and end.

---

the next thing I noticed is that there were some references to special relativity and the speed of light encoded in the pyramid as well. I think I can explain this.

I believe the pyramid was a structure designed to transform vibrations in the earth and to keep the tilt and the rotation speed constant. I also believe that the rotation speed of earth is directly linked to the speed of light, because as the earth rotates faster, it'll change the transmission medium, and so light will travel faster the faster earth rotates. therefore, because I believe the pyramid is designed to keep the rotation speed as constant as possible, it also keeps the speed of light pretty constant.

in fact, it will keep it pretty close to those constants which the pyramids encode, because that's what it's designed to do.

I'm nearly 100% certain that the speed of light will be different on mars.

related to this, I keep having these weird knowledge pass through my brain that there are two types of waves: ones that the wavelength is determined by time, and the other is determined by space. if mars' atmosphere was constantly and the spin decreasing, you can imagine how big of a problem it would be to use traditional electricity on mars. so many things are tied to the speed of light.

therefore, because mars had a constantly slowing speed of light, nothing could be tuned properly. instead, they had to run on spatial waves, relying on the propagation speed of waves in certain density mediums. they must have become experts in this as there are tons of tuned rocks that have their density and spatial characteristics tunes to the desired frequency (scoop marks and stuff).

I'm pretty certain that the great pyramid was designed to keep temporal wavelength constant (eg. speed of light) with the spatial one (gemetry of the earth and its resonant frequency at this density).

---

in the entry where I discussed gas giant planets having a physical reality, but we simply don't perceive it because our perception isn't tuned to that reality, I got a number of reactions that were very concerned that they would no longer be able to perceive our reality as the density of this planet began to change.

I believe this is the case already for the insides of many mountain ranges and also the "argatha" centre of the earth sort of things.. this must be why the entrance can only be perceived by some and under only certain circumstances.

as such, because we're no longer held to this physical density, the earth will spin much faster, psychic interaction with physical objects and the perception of the astral plane will become the norm.

in that same video, he mentioned that we gained a new sort of vision in 2020. coincidentally, the earth also in 2020 began to rotate faster. I think this is related. the people who are at a higher vibration experienced this expanded visual capacity, while other people did not.

I know that the purposefully decrease the frequency of my perception quite considerably, and so that's likely the reason why I and many others did not experience this change in perception.

again, I believe this is related to the speed of light and our imaginations are literally coalescing hydrogen into a reality perceivable to those tuned into it.

---

the last thing I wanted to mention is the 4 quadrants of the zodiac. also in that video he maps dimensions of thought into the 4 quadrants (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/r5Ng6V6WWog?t=6618)). I thought that was interesting because when I look at that from the perspective of the spring equinox, I see something similar.

from the perspective that I've come up with, enkidu went nurtured and grown up in the 2d,art quadrant from aquarius to saggitarius.

I map these quadrants into a binary list of male and female polarities. in the order of that graph,

- 1d: 0,0
  - female nurtures female
  - scorpio -> virgo
- 2d: 0,1
  - female nurtures male (aquarian man)
  - aquarius -> saggitarius
- 3d: 1,1
  - male nurtures male (present)
  - taurus -> picsis
- 4d: 1,0
  - male nurtures female (lion man)
  - leo -> gemini

---

this video really made me confused about what's is the message here. if we're going to aquarius, then the plan is to cultivate a new aquarian man. I suppose that could be done from mars, however for that to happen, the speed of light idea and special relativity may need to be reevaluated, as I think a lot of the physics "laws" including the gravitation constant and speed of light will likely work differently on mars.

---

the "salvatore mundi" saviour of the world picture (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/r5Ng6V6WWog?t=3967)) was shown to encode the alpha and omega of leo.

also, the last supper painting has the "triptych" architecture in the back. robert points out it strange that leonardo (lion man) paints himself as peter (the stone) in the picture.

the weird thing is that in triptych has the male on the left (this is also true for egyptian tombs) and the female on the right. it's weird that "mary" is in the male position, and on the right side in the female position, there are two.

when looking for the last supper picture on google, I [found this](http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-paintings/last-supper-leonardo-davinci.htm), claming that the feminine one in the male position is john, jesus' most beloved. super duper no homo.

da vinci certainly knew of this triptych layout, and certainly placed that into the image on purpose. even more strange is that robert claims that peter (the stone) is holding a knife as if he's the betrayer, bet judas holds the bag presumably of silver.

why would da vinci (the lion man) paint himself into the position of peter (the stone)?

so, are we heading toward the aquarian man or the lion man?

### 2021-10-01 04:20 - lion man followup

I don't really know what it all means. I just know that there is something significant to him placing the triptych thing behind jesus. there must be a reason he wanted to go out of his way to denote male and female.

if I were da vinci and I were painting it, I would probably put peter in the male position, because the male dominated church was founded on peter. I would put john in the female position. so the fact that john looks very effeminate and is leaning at an angle of the pyramid, while in the male position *must* mean something. he wouldn't put the triptych if he didn't want to say something.

the pyramid is in the masculine place. however, obelisks (like the one in the vatacan) are the masculine symbol. obelisks (like the tesla coil) are designed to be the receivers of the energy. sin embargo, the chevrons above the decending passageway are looking pretty feminine to me -- just sayin...

---

the second thing to note is that da vinci is painting himself in as peter, the stone. in my studies when it comes to anything related to these people that come to bring in the next era, they never seem to get their desired reality to fully come to fruition. I believe that they *are* successful, however because not everyone wants to live their future, so it creates a split because of incompatible realities. each time there is a split, a stone is left behind. examples of this are einstein, peter, the great pyramid, etc.

to understand this, imagine that I am a perceiver of my reality, therefore everything is a reflection of my perception, so I will attract a future that I want. if a split happens because of an incompatible reality, it can only happen (from my perspective) because I sabotaged it. no one can create for me. therefore, in the reality that is incompatible with my perception, it must appear like I sabotaged it. that is the only way it could happen, otherwise.

so meanwhile, we're all on my timeline it will reflect my perception. nosebook can try to fight my perception for as much as they want, but eventually I will find my connection. this is certain. the only way that could not happen is if I personally sabotage it (in which case, I'll leave a stone behind).

---

what we have is an incompatible reality on multiple fronts. I want to do the mars thing, but that reality is incompatible with those wanting to keep secrets and hold on to einstein's relativity. it'll be hard to keep that charade going from the perspective of mars; very hard.

that means a split is coming up here soon and it's inevitable. what I am fairly certain will happen is that earth will begin to spin faster and faster and the magnetic field will continue to increase such that all emotion will be in super intensity. this is really good for a low density environment because you need that kind of density (focus) to hold reality together and maintain some semblance of persistence.

the speed will continue to increase until there is a split. we will continue on living in a world where things are a product of our perception, while it will appear as if I had sabotaged myself.

I suggested that one way to buy some time would be to transfer my consciousness into jackson. that would give a lot more time, however there are still a lot of problems.

---

the main problem is that me finding my alignment is an incompatible reality. if the earth's spin is increasing because of increased emotion, when I find my connection, it's really going to accelerate at a very fast rate until everyone incompatible with that speed will make their transition.

the solution that I proposed to that is to do a physical separation instead. if they're at mars, we can have a nice separation where we transform perception for the martians. our difference in feeling will ensure that we don't collide but continue to orbit each other. we utilise each others' energies for our purposes.

that's such a radical difference and obviously there are so many secrets that cannot be maintained if that's the case.

from a LOA perspective, this is the manifestation that you get what you desire, whether you want it or not. assume for a moment that the atlantians wanted to find a way to have the humans do the work for them to be able to keep their atmosphere working well and give them the conditions that they desire. they tried to do it by keeping us as slaves, but that fell apart. now, the manifestation of that desire is finally coming, however, instead of enjoying the journey to the manifestation of that desire with a steady stream of wanted, it has instead been only a stream of perceived unwanted.

your desires will always manifest eventually. you can try to keep yourself from them for as long as possible. however, they *will* manifest, and they'll manifest as a reflection of your perception. so for example, if you only perceive unwanted, then even the appearance of your desire will also be perceived as unwanted.

---

that said, I don't think we're doing the mars thing. it's probably ahead of it's time. we've got to get to leo first, it looks. then, fight the hydra, etc. remember, I'm the one sabotaging this. I get to decide what reality I experience.

from this perspective, I want to continue to use this time to further improve my capacity to feel the way I want to feel. whether this is the sabotage or not doesn't matter to me because eventually I'll put myself in an endless rebirth to accomplish that. I plan on playing my own game. the hydra must be fought.

you have to remember, that from my broader perspective, which I don't have -- I am also the opposition. from this perspective, I'm just kenny.

what I'm saying is, the martian timeline exists already. however, this is one that is guaranteed to be a split because all options appear to be incompatible realities.

### 2021-10-01 16:05 - so you want the aquarian man?

after a number of reactions, I think I figured out a solution. the nice thing is that it actually fits the storyline, too.

coincidentally, graham mentioned that ankor wat is 72(degrees) latitude west of the great pyramid. I went on to google maps and looked and sure enough it is. interestingly enough 72(degrees) increments are:
- mid-atlantic ridge (atlantis)
- ankor wat up through china up to near where tunguska event happened
- baja california up through utah up to canada
- some place in the pacific on the island chain toward hawaii
- giza / great pyramid

I see a pentagon.

since the 1900's the magnetic pole has been migrating from the top of the -113(degrees) longitude point in canada, and is now heading toward the ankor wat / tunguska point.

originally I thought maybe it moved in a star pattern, but now I don't know. I simply don't have enough information to say much further there.

however, what I believe the gizah complex was for is to fix the rotation speed of the earth by transforming earth energies stresses into higher frequency energies.

what I think happens when this magnetic pole shifts, it causes huge stresses on the earth which eventually results in an enormous fratture. the more stress that is there, the bigger the fracture. the most devastating of these stresses would be the last one in the mid-atlantic ridge.

if indeed when the magnetic field moves away from one of these vertical lines, it creates a huge fracture, then in this case california would completely fracture away from the coast.

I can't really figure out the order or their intervals. I tried to figure out the order but it doesn't seem to make ordered sense to me.

however, what does make sense to me is the idea that these energies can be transformed. I propose that once I'm connected, I'll be able to create pretty big things. my idea is to figure out how to make another pyramid or something else which takes earth energies and transforms them into a higher frequency (beneficial) energies.

I don't really know how exactly to do it, but I do know it can be done. my intuition says that some place along that line will do quite well to quell those stored energies. the idea would be to make a self-correcting system which fixes the rotation speed to a certain a certain speed, thereby fixing the speed of light.

---

this kinda fits in well with the stroryline of the hunchback of notre dame, where he releases the girl to apollo. hugo was very explicit about the story being about architecture and the the universal message that these structures encode in them. therefore, the structure "notre dame" which means, "our lady" is really the princess that quasimodo is releasing. the princess is just something to hang the story on. the princess is symbolic of architecture and the thing that the architecture encodes.

I know that robert's kid is named apollo. I'm sure they're very alike and I'm sure all of that is just a coincidence.

---

anyway, from my perspective, it looks like the tasks that remain are to continually get better and perceiving and tuning to the disired aspect of things. eventually, I'll find my connection and the creation of large-scale structures will be as simple as manifesting the way it feels. things need to be considered like what the desired speed of light will be, and things like that. I'll be able to translate the way he feels with all of those mathematical constants into a structure with relative ease. it's almost as if we've done this before...

anyway, I have no problem if the desire is to go toward aquarius. no problem from me.

it does rewrite the story a bit and make a lot more things much more convenient for them. the structure will create the perception matrix, not me, so it'll be fixed (never increasing in speed). it's probably also possible to make various layers as well, so like the masses get one frequency, the inner circle get another, and then only the priests able to enter the holy of holies get another.

sure, I'm down with that. I guess we'll work together sometime in the future to figure out those details.

### 2021-10-02 02:57 - some more thoughts on the aquarius

the reactions have been kind of interesting around the idea of going to aquarius. the sense that I get is that people keep saying the age of aquarius like it's some sort of marketing buzzword but none of the higher ups actually belive that's where we're going.

what I mean is, if one looks at government policy financial stuff and everything else, almost no one has a plan beyond 2040 (other than projections), and no one really has an idea what to do after 2050.

it seems like they're all hoping for this cataclysm. all they need to do is to survive it and then set up after that.

so, when I come along and say that I think it'll be possible to make a solution that will prevent it from happening and we can go into the age of aquarius, there feels to be some pushback.

wait, that's weird because I was also feeling pushback from the leo, gilgamesh and labours of heracles idea too.

there is this idea that there are too many people on this planet and we don't have the resources to sustain growth like this, while at the same time there is talk of a coming golden age starting in the age of aquarius. it can't be both.

the reality is, we do have the capability to support many more people on this planet -- just, they don't want to.

---

the other reaction was around the realisation that where the magnetic field is stronger, there is more innovation, stronger feeling. previously this was on the west coast, california, seattle, vancouver, etc. but now this is moving over to east russia, china, thailand, malaysia, etc.

it's kind of crazy to think that all of the land of innovation and insight will move over to the east. a complete reversal of our western dominated world today.

---

personally, I'm actually starting to like the idea. I think it's a great idea for western thought power to rapidly decline. it'll be interesting to see what happens honestly. I know that robert knows mandarin and korean so that's likely something he has intuitively begun to prepare for. nice.

there are so many things that will have to be done but I think it's fine. it's kind of a perfect timing thing because naturally conditions will continue to get better, meaning lifespans will increase, less sickness, more intelligent people, etc. it really will be the start of the golden age.

---

there is another thing that I wanted to talk about which is that it's sort of going about things the opposite way, but I don't really think that's a bad thing. if there's one thing I've found is that going toward the seemingly "worst" manifestation always has unexpectedly good results that happen naturally because of LOA. I'm generally interested in seeing what a golden age founded on special relativity and a fixed speed of light will result in.

I'll be stuck in it too. I'll make my transition into another kid and grow up just like everyone else in the system. it's the same problem of fighting the hydra, but it'll be in aquarius instead. he'll have to mix me and put me into increasingly more difficult situations so that I never find my connection again.

I personally like the idea. I think it adds further to the difficulty as well.

---

there's another level of difficulty upgrade that I'd like to mention as well. I hadn't been thinking on it and had completely forgotten about it, till jerrica reminded me of it today. it's actually quite fortuitous because I didn't know how to put it into words for "enki's trick (part two)". it's the missing link I was looking for to connect the increase in feeling to the third part.

anyway, consider that sex with will girls have a pleasure addiction related to the dragons wanting to retain their clear perception, but at the same time the increase the intensity wich one feels something. that's one ingredient.

the second is that a girl starts out with a clean slate and is naturally attracted to boys, but as she gets older she begins to gain an idea of how men are, and therefore what to expect from them. the younger they are, the less convoluted this is, unless she's been abused since younger.

any boy she meets and gets into a relationship with *must* conform to her perception of how men are. she has to be right about what she believes is true. this is true for many other subjects as well, and a woman that believes well of a man can be a very strong motivating force for him. the strongest of these relationships is when the girl mostly perceives with desire (1) (someone like esther), and when the boy is a physical/mechanical (7). these are the prototypical hermes and aphrodite. when they're combined into a single person, it's the "hermaphrodite".

these hermaphrodites have a balance between both male and female and are the centre of the triptych. "when the two I/eyes become single". as shorthand, I call them the x3.

anyway, those guys are the next custodians and the next root race for humankind.

what's important about this is that we're moving into the aquarius -> saggitarius quadrant, which is the one that I defined as "women nurturing men". I define the quadrant as different from the one where we're in now as "men nurturing men". the last time we had this happen was after the peak closeness to sirius and energies were lowering (0.5->0).

at the beginning of the phase, energies were at their highest, so the manifestation of the way a woman perceives a man was about where it's at now. over time, her ability to perceive him and have attract that reality lowered over time, giving the impression for the men that they had increased capability to dominate. this was the upper paleolithic, neolithic when organised warfare began to become more and more of a thing until it became so dominant that it caused the horus kings to completely wipe out all forms of the goddess culture.

this time however, the influence will be the same but energies will be *increasing*, meaning that as we get closer and closer to sirius, their capacity to conform men to their perception of men will increase. this will be a very different landscape.

this adds an entire new level of difficulty to the whole ordeal. it won't be much more difficult to ensure that I'm never allowed to interact with young girls which may have a positive perception of me, but instead only to be with ones that have already been programmed to already have preconceived perceptions of "how all men are". other variations include getting me to depend on them for my perceptive conditions and then causing a crash and burn (much like raquel).without access to abraham and if I have a special relativity (impactors, collisions, and propultion) view of reality, it may take me quite a while to remember how things really work.

I welcome the challenge. I believe I've talked myself into it. even though other people don't have plans for anything past 2050, I'm excited to try this reality out. the worst that could happen is that he doesn't stop me from finding my alignment the next time :)

---

the last thing to think of was why I mentioned that the structure should be tuned to have a fixed improvement. that was because if it were done like the great pyramid was done with an inverse feedback loop, where the more harmful earth energies put into it produces more enlightenment, then it rewards a worse perception. naturally, the body will learn this feedback, and notice that the more focus on unwanted, the more expanded the perception.

another idea would be to create a feedback loop where a group of females were given stronger perception the more harmful earth energies there are, and the males are given stronger perception as a function of the females' harmful energies.

there are various ideas to be brainstormed for sure, but a positive reward for negative effects sounds like recipe for a disaster.


### 2021-10-03 00:40 - not sure how I feel about this

a number of interesting things happened today which have left me not so sure what I feel. mom told me that she thinks dad's heath is deteriorating very rapidly and it's not likely he'll last much longer. I didn't feel like I wanted to go to LA anyway so I declined to go even still.

then, mom asked me if I was OK going to becky's house. I agreed to go. that produced a lot of reactions, and then I went to sleep for a bit. when I woke up, I had a lot of different ideas in my head about how to try and use the girls to manipulate me and other attempts to try and make it as difficult as possible for me to find my connection with the girls. reason is, if I'm going over there before I've found my connection, then we're sort of on the rocky style storyline where it's training and improvements.

I honestly like that idea the best because I like steady improvements more than I like big manifestations, so this seems like a pretty good idea for me. especially if there is going to be efforts to try and use the girls to try and keep me from my connection. there will be all sorts of difficulties and things which we'll have to figure out.

there are two problems with that. first, it's kind of a system that rewards problems (the squeaky wheel gets the grease). so, the girls with the most difficulties gets the most attention. great for ratings I guess. the other problem is that almost always my solution to the difficulty will be to find a way to perceive the same thing in a way which feels OK to good. we'll practise getting good at that. however, it doesn't actually incentivise them to actually *want* to feel good.

for example, yesterday jerrica was perfectly content to feel terrible. she'd rather continue to believe that kyle is misbehaving and needs to be punished for it. she has no disire to feel good, because she quite notably felt terrible.

I don't know how nasty any of the disagreements could possibly get, but there is little incentive for any of them to want to feel good. they can just use the condition (me or whatever situation) to feel good. rewarding the most problematic is going to produce the opposite of what I want to convey. in fact, the audience will benefit a lot more from the interactions than they will just because the audience has a greater desire to want to find a way to perceive their reality in a way which feels good (so they can attract a better feeling reality). man, I don't know how to explain this concept very well.

the whole thing of what I've been doing is finding a way to perceive my reality in a way which is constantly feeling better. by getting better and better at this, I'm able to essentially see right through a lot of the mechanical illusion presented by the "facts".

I really enjoy continuing on my journey getting better and better at that. I really cannot explain (though I'm going to try in my next entry) to explain what it's like to be able to do what I'm doing. I'm clearly not there yet because I'm still not able yet to feel the way I want to feel about anything. if I felt like a tiger, I would appear like a tiger to you all. if I felt light, I could float. if I felt like I could pee, I could pee.

obviously, I still have a little ways to go. I estimate I still have at least a few months until I'm quite practised at feeling how I want to feel.

from my perspective, there really is no rush. I want to figure out a way to produce a situation where I can be with the girls, but that it won't be an easy one, and they'll simply have to find a way to perceive the situation in a way which feels good to them. I don't know how to do that.

---

the thing is too, that it's none of my business what any of the girls do. if they wish to become very conditional and try and find ways to utilise conditions rather than perception to feel the way they want, that's entirely their decision. that has nothing to do with me.

this is essentially the problem with all manifestations -- they are conditions, and obviously I don't have anything to do with how other people perceive those conditions. like dad: he has condittons around him and it's his decision to perceive those conditions however he chooses. this has nothing to do with me.

speaking of which, one of the thoughts that passed through my mind today was the possibility of transferring dad's consciousness into jackson's body on birth. that idea felt very good to me, and strangely enough it sort of fits with that one idea where I noticed that I was experiencing both sides of the monomyth simultaneously -- with the exception of "attonement with the father" I thought maybe would be something perhaps to do with mr. motor, but I imagine that I'll know jackson at least once in the future, and if that's dad, then maybe that's that. who knows. I look for symbolic patterns everywhere I go. I can't help it.

---

the last major hurdle for me is that I'm kind of ho-hum about the whole thing. it doesn't feel at all like something that I feel comfortable being able to accomplish. I know there will be tons of failures, so I guess we'll just have to get used to that. it's definitely going to have to be a thing where it's OK to fail. I'm pretty good at failing though so this really isn't a problem for me. I just don't like dragging other people into my failures.

it's not performance anxiety because I just do my best no matter what I'm doing. that has to be good enough, but I do already know that measured physically it won't be good enough. however, I do know that I'll be able to feel good about it no matter what. I think that's what makes me popular to people is that I don't have any miraculous physical skills. I only show capability to perceive things in a way which feels good, about thing most people would be embarrassed or feel bad about. I am good at that, true.

---

when it comes to the idea of creating a structure (or various structures) capable of transforming earth's vibrations into higher frequency vibrations, is actually my main subject of interest right now.

ever since I talked about the difference between temporally resonant energies (electrons) and spatially resonant energies (protons), I've been thinking a lot about how to use hydrogen to transform earth's energies like earthquakes into high frequency protons, which I associate with consciousness and perception. I really think there is something to the "giza power plant" idea, cept I don't think that chemicals were used as the source of hydrogen. I think the hydrogen was pulled in from the environment, and the queen's chamber shafts were tuning mechanisms.

it feels like I can see how the whole thing fits together if I could play around with it a bit more in my mind. it feels like there are missing pieces to my understanding of the thing, but I feel like I'm starting to get close. it shouldn't be too long before I attract the understanding I need for those missing pieces.

I figure that this structure needs to go up rather soon, and definitely 2038 will be the deadline for that one considering that each 8 solar cycles will be stronger than the last until the gleissberg cycle resets.

I find it interesting to think about what others think of that idea. I have the sense that it's kinda split. some want the disaster and others want the 5d age of aquarius. maybe it's both. I don't really know.

it feels to me like I will want to find my connection before too long so that can happen.

---

there's also a weird thing that I noticed with the magnetic field too. I had an idea in the shower called "making the veil" where large HHO generators are put in the oceans. just assume they have the capacity to generate large portions of power to run these things. the hydrogen will be released up and out of the water. the oxygen will be combined with other oxygen to form O2 and then a carbon added to it, creating CO2, which is then released in mass into the air. this will greatly reduce the magnetic field of the earth because the surface receives less solar energy.

anyway, this idea must have been a gift from YHVH for them because right after having the idea is when the girls thing was proposed. they must feel confident they can quell the effects of a strengthinging magnetic field and slow earth's rotation again.

whatever happened, they must have figured how to regulate it because the field will rise rapidly and then immediately it drops down instantly or flatlines when otherwise it would be a very strong field. this has happened three times now right when I started to feel the girls quite strongly (sat 08:30, sun 09:00, sun 23:10).

so, it appears they can manipulate field strength pretty well which is what I associate with heat, but they can't really reduce the high frequency vibrations. I experience this as more detailed emotions and knowledge, but less intense. it's no longer like a strong knowing, but instead like a small inkling. good for practise.

---

so I have no idea what is in store for my stay at becky's house... I guess we'll have to see.

one thing is that I am thinking it may be kind of best to start small. then, there are a few paths: if the girls can create replicas, then we can do that other invite-only type network (this direction has an exclusive feel to it) or to expand slowly creating something similar to the "cultures" idea from a long time ago (also feels pretty exclusive).

personally, because I want to find my connection, I'm just going to keep holding back and expanding. I want to hang out with becky cause that sounds fun, but I don't really want to make anything happen. it'll happen probably whenever it becomes inevitable.

### 2021-10-03 16:55 - some more thinking

I think there was some reactions to what I said last night about dad. first of all, I think there is a difficulty in society around the perception of death. there's nothing bad about it. the person just leaves our physically perceivable frequency range; that's it. the other thing is our society wants us to hold on to people that are dying and not let them die, probably because it's a hugely profitable industry keeping people who's bodies don't want to be here for longer. it costs a lot of money to keep them alive and almost all illness close to is pure profit. they don't want heath remedies that actually solve the problem, cause that would be a loss of profit.

I have been wanting a system where people can pick the parents of a baby that's about to be born, and then when the waters break, they have a little bit of time to get ready for their transition into the baby's body. I feel like that would be a whole lot more effective way to deal with death and also would be hugely profitable for the system that makes this possible.

besides that though, the direction that dad's body is taking (the conditions of his manifestation) are just that -- conditions. his only job is to find a way to feel good about the conditions that he finds himself in.

the feeling of good or bad is an emotional reaction to perception. whenever something feels bad, then that means the underlying perception is not in alignment with the way the "higer self" inner divinity, source or whatever sees the same set of conditions.

---

I mentioned this because that's the same thing I'm going through right now. after I wrote that long ramble, I went outside and started to think about it. an image popped into my head reminding me of the scene in the matrix where trinity brings neo back to life when she kisses him. he had died in the matrix to agent smith. later on he defeates agent smith when he becomes agent.

however, the idea of being saved by someone seems repulsive to me. I have gone to great extents to learn how to not rely on other people for a manifestation that this feels counter-intuitive to me.

the reality is, I'm getting very good at what I do. like, really really good -- and, I don't think it would take more than a year or so to be able to accomplish it myself.

---

the obvious connection between these two concepts is that just like I was saying about dad that the conditions are just that, and I too have to find a way to perceive those conditions in a way that feels good.

that's it really. I went to sleep pretty distraught about this because it feels like I'm completely out of control and I'm sort of just going with the flow. that really is the aquarian man. it's a guy that feels so strongly that feeling is primary reality, and he navigates based on how he feels, not the physical manifestations that are happening. a sort of "go with the flow and find a way to feel good about it anyway" guy.

that really is the way that I perceive myself: stick me into any situation and no matter what it is, I find my way back to feeling good about it, and nevermind the physical conditions.

this is a nearly perfect host for parasites, and I think a lot of people have used me to create the things that they want. I have recognised this, and is the whole concept behind the galaxy/mars idea. they can just use my energy to feel good. obviusly when dependent on someone else, it inspires them to feel worse because they feel like they can't control it -- but, they have no other choice. if they don't depend on someone else to create their reality for them, everything will come crashing down. this is fine though because I continue to feel better, so it doesn't matter how much worse they feel, I'll feel better so it's like a net zero, and I think I actually more of a net gain. it's the whole concept behind going for the worst manifestation.

I always shoot for the best manifestation, but they will constantly prevent that and ensure that it's not the best. well, eventually, the "worst" manifestation isn't that bad, even though it could be so much more. I just have to constantly find a way to feel good anyway.

---

I was thinking about this as a sequence of changes, and each time that I wait (or walk away) from the manifestation that I don't want, then it builds up to a bigger manifestation. this is good right now while I'm still quite physically oriented. the longer I wait, the bigger and better the manifestation becomes.

it's like compound interest. however when I withdrawl that money I begin to incur losses from the physical manifestation (like homes deteriorate, need repairs, etc). the ideal would be have a continuous stream of incremental manifestations, never with any of them too strong that they catch my attention too much, and each leaving the most to be desired. I don't believe that can be done physically. instead, if manifestations become more frequent, it has to be perception that keeps me from getting caught in the manifestation[^1].

so the way this looks to me is a good way to practise to become much more interested in how I feel than what is happening physically around me. the better I get at that, the more I will gain that perception.

---

finally, a tale of two earths. the other thing I noticed in all of this when I thought about the old "cultures" idea, is that I may have been more cancer-like back then, but now I am basically very capricorn. I want to do things my own way, yet it appears that I'm going to find myself in a much more cancer-like manifestation.

the effect I think this has is a slight shift in the split that's going to happen. I actually don't believe there will be a cataclysm (unless we come back to sabotage it, that is). I think there are two major lines of expression here, one being the aquarian (go with the flow) man. and the lion man. the way I see it, the aquarian man will not have a cataclysm because there are ways to fix that problem, and it feels like there are people who want to actually go toward wanted. I will label this group the "let's min/max us and our conditions". it's conditional sure, but they know what they want and they know how to get it. it feels to me like they have a much more softness to female in that they think they are important.

the other group is the lion man group, and this is largely the "I want to know my receptive side and girls are the ones that need improving". I kind of fit into both of those categories, actually. not only do I like the idea of being a lot more receptive to my reality as a reflection of how I perceive/feel, but I also like min/maxing all aspects of myself.

it occurred to me that it's likely that both of these realities may take place, and we'll just be separated by time, rather than space. it may even be the case that we have contact between the two planets and even trade between them too.

so, in that sense, there is no need to try and figure out how to separate us physically. we can instead just go different ways. more on that idea later, but I don't think either will experience a cataclysm.

btw, providing a way for people to conveniently upgrade their bodies solves the over-population issue, maintains profit for those wanting to continue to capitalise on that, and other things, too :)

this likely isn't the final plan. I have a way of flip-flopping back and fourth, meanwhile moving the centre in the direction that feels best. so expect further ideas.

no matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world.

[1]: as time goes on, in order to escape these constant physical manifestations, I'll manifest bodies that have less and less interest in the physical and become more and more conceptual. so, like source is basically non-physical on one end and they keep becoming more non-physical being so much further out ahead (as a function of frequency of perception), than we are. a planet would be more. a star even more... the higher up you go, the less physical things are and the more conceptual they become.

### 2021-10-04 18:05 - the tree of the knowledge of good and evil

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HscbeaOxIc)

I watched this yesterday and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the clip. I had no idea about the sybyll which told the roman timeline up till 2012. he also talked about spontaneous emergence of life. I first saw this with david puchta's experiments with his "linear paul magnetezium"(?). I obviously have a similar thinking that life can emerge, grow, and thrive in even the harshest of conditions. I have often been fascinated by this resiliance that some lifeform exhibit. they usually appear to be more simple creatures, less complicated lifeforms -- sort of like biological robots.

that video is quite old, so I continued on to see what his latest stuff was about. the only other reference I had was some other guy I saw on youtube making fun of his new ascension 3.0 or something -- as if, the previous two versions weren't very good. I will admit it had enough camera angles and buzzwords to fully qualify for "all flash and no substance" marketing, but I was surprised how coherent he was in that last video.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YlPx0-ebVU)

this one is totally different. he has fully taken the modern ETs approach to evolution of humankind. now, instead of spontaneous emergence of life each with a connection to source, and no real need for evolution -- just connection, now it's the ETs that want us to evolve, learn our lessons and grow up.

there is one part in the video where the minister (forgot his name) is talking about how jesus was explaining the separating of the wheat from the tares. they're allowed to grow together for a time, then they're harvested separated and then the weeds are thrown into the fire.

like I said, I have long been fascinated with these ultra resiliant organisms that can grow under even the harshest of conditions. I have not wondered how to get rid of them, but how to utilise their resiliance to produce a desirable organism that is capable of thriving in harsh circumstances.

wheat needs a certain set of conditions to grow well. they're much more conditional than the weeds are.

---

anyway, when he was talking about that part where the "deceiver" had planted the weeds in the same field as the wheat, I said, "that's me" -- implying that I am the deceiver, the 7-headed dragon, satan/saturn, etc. now, whether I am actually, is kind of open for debate. say for example I am just a golem that is finding my connection to my source. it doesn't really matter the "identity" that I am. instead, I just follow my instinct considering the conditions.

I've said also previously that I see a lot of similarities between myself and hitler. I could just as easily have been anyone from joan of arc to joseph smith. I really don't know. I found it weird in crowley's invocation of pan, he has all faces, and can take on any form.

---

now, I'd like to talk about the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. I consider these trees to be talking about two major sections of the brain, namely the PFC and the tree of life being the reptile brain.

it's the gods of eden that have perception of the difference between good and evil, and I believe that the fire that enki gave us is the PFC, which right between the lobes is that pinecone, and the fire. I consider the reptile brain to be one's connection to source. it's instinctual and the most primitive part of the brain. the other side is perception, and this is the most complicated part of the brain -- the PFC. the PFC is the tuner and the reptile brain is the instinct.

however, between the two of these lobes is the limbic (mammalian) brain, and this is what enables some mammals to be herded, while herding reptiles is a joke. some mammals have this more active than others: consider sheeps and goats, cats and dogs, etc.

the main reason why I hang a lot of my understanding on a few pillars of perception is because of the power social perception has on the transition between perception and instinct is considerable. it's important to eshtablish a good connection to what you're tuned in to.

if you're swayed by social pressures easily, you're diverting or inhibiting those signals before they can take effect. I mean obviously. you don't want to be like a child and just say whatever comes to your mind. you care about how people perceive you. you need to conform to social expectations, so you need to redirect those unacceptable instincts.

---

ok, now we have a look at perception. there is an idea that things are good or bad. however, that just isn't true. good and bad are constructs that society impose on perception, and other things that you inherit from your culture, parents, or whatever. doesn't really matter where it came from.

what matters is that it's malleable and that you can perceive anything in any way that you want to perceive it. this the foundation of all sales and marketing. the difference is they're trying to sell things, and I'm saying that perception is your tuner. it's easy to notice how much environmental conditions has an effect on perception -- like if you're eating wheat flower or not. however, I'm much more weedlike in the sense that I don't believe that conditions are everything. I think it has to do with perception. so if seemingly undesirable conditions can be perceived in a way which makes them tolerable or desirable, then they stop having a negative effect. as an example, if I brush my teeth with flouride, I get crazy visions and stuff. whereas, for others this apparently calcifies the pineal.

---

so, you have these two trees and they both have their good sides and bad sides. personally, I don't find anything wrong with addictive people, because they're mostly in the reptile brain. a lot have even bypassed the social pressures to be a way and will follow that addiction even though their behaviour has been demonised by someone influential. sure, it's true that these addicted people have the perception that the whatever addiction is their only way to feel good. no big deal. they'll eventually get tired of it theirselves. I definitely don't want to try and influence/shepherd them to go the way I think they should go.

---

responding to the feedback about the weeds being thrown into fire now. energy will continue to rise and and that'll amplify all emotion -- both the good and the bad. you may come to the conclusion that you want to find conditions which produce good results (like the wheat) or you may want to find a way to perceive the conditions in a way which makes them appear tolerable or desirable.

I think the image of the fire is a bit misleading. first of all, fire is what prometheus gave to the humans when we got the PFC, which I believe works directly with the pineal, and this is what produces the fire.

fire is none other than a reality that is moving so fast, that it could be perceived as fire because the way you feel is manifesting your reality rapidly. if you don't feel good, it'll be uncomfortable and bothersome (like a bad trip), but if you feel good, you'll feel good.

in the first video, david described this as a galactic wave. others have said that this galactic wave is the precursor to the mininova. I am of the opinion that all solar activity is a result of the different planet's perceptual differences.

right now, the solar cycle is locked to jupiter and his perception. when other planet's magnetic (emotional/conceptual) interaction with the sun produces incompatible realities, these produce sunspots and even sometimes flares.

I don't know if it is a galactic wave or not. I don't have enough information to tell. whether it's a galactic wave or someone with strong perception like me that's increasing energies, it's a super amplifier, so if you feel bad, you'll feel worse, and if you feel good you'll feel better. you can imagine that will increase the number of incompatible realities on the sun, which will cause that mininova event.

so, whether this fire is a mininova, galactic wave, increase in earth's magnetic field, someone like me's effect on society, or some combination of those is irrelevant to me. clearly this is the time of increased perception (call it ascension if you want) for all.

time to get used to creating your reality at ever increasing speeds.

### 2021-10-04 23:34 - I'm getting close

I was out watching stars just now and it was pretty easy to get into the zone. I actually got so close to the edge tonight that I even began to feel the tingling sensation at the bottom of my spine that happens when the "kundalini" energy rises up the spine. I stopped it though.

last night, I totally lost concentration because the feeling was so warm and soothing that I nearly went over the edge also. I came in and tried to go to sleep, but every time that I relaxed, I got the same "swooning" sensation that happens before entering into a full visionary experience. it had the extra effect of feeling weightless and that my perception was also lifting out of my body. again, I stopped it.

my goal is to continue on getting that close but actively stopping it. my goal is to see if I can figure out a way to make that one structure that I was talking about that will transform earth energies into higher frequency ones.

I really have been thinking about this a lot because the structure is actually two part. electricity, like the network can couple with something in space, like a person's nervious system, the retina of the eye or whatever -- and couple with the person's vibrations (emotion, thought, sensation, etc.). however, something like the great pyramid is not dynamic in that sense. it can only resonate with similar proton density things. people come in all shapes and sizes, but the resonance of the earth changes seldomly.

therefore, to create a system that couples with both the earth and also people was previously impossible. it has only been since the invention of tesla's world system that something like this is possible. creating a feedback loop similar to the one I proposed. I still don't know if it's the best idea, but it goes like this:

a group of people are selected (G1), and their perception (G2P) is inversely proprtional to planet's energetic env (PE). a second group's perception (G2P) is inversely proportional to G1E. finally, the earth's perception (conductivity of the air?) is inversely proportional to G2E.

when g2e decreases, pp increases
when pe decreases, g1p increases
when g1e decreases, g2p decreases

something like that. it's pretty difficult to try and relate these in maths identiteies, but the idea is that they balance each other out. 

so like imagine I'm a person living on the planet and I'm not in either of those groups. I want better conditons, so that means I desire for g2e to decrease. if I am desiring for someone else to have more disharmonious vibrations, then that means I too am tuned into that so that means that I'll begin to have an effect on the planet. the stronger one's perception, the more effect they have on the planet. therefore, because pe is decreasing, g1p will increase. if g1e decreases as a result, then g2p will increase.

man, I'm getting confused really badly. I can't figure out how to model this in my head and I'm too lazy to run a program. it can be modeled pretty easily though. as a person's perception increases, they have more of an effect on the planet, theirselves and those around them (basic LOA). obviously some will be more affected than others, so there is some dynamic to it and this can be used to determine the hidden variable of that person's perceptive resiliance.

this is too hard. I don't want to figure this out :)

### 2021-10-05 23:10 - I'm essentially a construct of their perception

I woke up this afternoon with a numbe of different reactions, mostly concerning who I am. I don't know who I am. if I did, I'd be connected. (11:11) all consciousness cascades downward out of its source. this is why the perfectly good brand-new cells in your body orgalise into a structure that appears old.

anyway, on to the reactions... the first one is the observation that if I were put into many different timelines and performed deeds for the custodians, then does that make me bad.

my response to that is, no it just makes me very conditional. depending on the conditions that I'm put in and the circumstances that I'm around I behave different ways. for example, I grew up in a weird christian cult. I could sense that something wasn't quite right -- but, how did I know that? in a previous lifetime almost certainly I just followed blindly believing whatever they say. as usual, the person asking questions is perceived as dangerous. they can't really tell dad that he can't bring one of his kids to church so they just kept an eye on me, most likely noticing that I was becoming a bigger and bigger problem. they left the church early on in my life (think I was like 8-10yo).

what I mean is those conditions no longer got me. I remain pretty naive and can believe people easily, but I learn as I go.

as a kid, I grew up thinking war was a good thing and that it's important to be sure that "God" is always winning. I also liked guns and all sorts of stuff. so, starting there, I could easily see that given the right circumstances and influences, I could easily be someone like hitler or something. I remember distinctly that implements of war made me feel really good. I really liked the idea of creating things that can kill more people.

so what seems to be the case is that I'm directly influenced by how things feel to me. it would have been very easy to get me involved with the military -- that is, until I showed up to boot-camp. there is nothing that feels good about boot-camp. similarly, there was nothing that felt good about the cult we were in either which is why I was asking so many questions. however, for example later on we went to the revival movement. there were a lot of bad vibes I remember from a lot of dudes that wanted to get especially handsy with female church attendents, especially while praying for people. however, I did also notice that I did actually see people getting healed, and there were a lot of genuine moments that felt good.

I used to be very "all or nothing" with my perception too, thinking that something was either pure evil or pure good. I noticed that started to change when I was in paznaz, because again there were a lot of genuinely good-feeling things that happened. I can't just throw away everything just cause some part of it felt bad.

---

so, what I'm trying to say is that I previously ran away or fought against the things that felt bad to me. that makes me very easy to guide. because I'm so naive, using mostly conditions, I can easily be guided toward the things that feel good to me. I can also associate certain emotions with other emotions pretty easily, so for example, you can imagine that someone who associates getting angry with feeling powerful (like every hollywood movie depicts), then one can easily create a hitler if you could reinforce the association of a feeling of power with a good feeling. then, just associate the feeling of power with getting angry. mix in a few more ingredients and you have your power hungry dictator recipe ready to go.

this sort of being guided only based on how I feel, isn't the best way -- though it is better than consciously trying to push through all of the stuff that feels bad. there are also improvements that I can make on the conceptual associations that are made in my mind -- though, I don't know yet what they are.

so, instead of just being purely guided by how things feel now, I take a new approach. this is sort of like LOA-2.0... the idea is that instead of tryign to go away from or go toward things that don't and do feel good, instead, I have learned to simply lower my resistance to whatever the manifestation may be, and if it feels bad, instead of running from or avoiding it, to instead perceive it in a way which feels good.

this is essentially the difference between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of what feels good and what feels bad. in the tree of life, things are no longer perceived as being either good or bad anymore. they're all attracted based on a perception that I have, so I can either feel good (or not bad) about the manifestation -- or, I can change the perception which is attracting that manifestation.

that's all there is to it; it really is that easy...

---

ok, now the other reaction was around why when I'm watching stars don't I just push through? just a few years ago I was talking about how eventually their machines would no longer be able to hold me back from getting connected and so I could get it anyway no matter what they're doing.

that is true. I don't feel it necessary to get the manifestation. I prefer the practise. if they really wanted me to be connected, they would let go. you could also consider that they're actually slowing me down by not pushing so hard against me. I'm not really all that interested in trying to push through, so I'm actually self-limiting.

what this means, in the bigger picture is that I'm construct of their perception. my reaction to them previously was illustrative of how they were going about things. they were pushing really hard and trying to make things happen, and I mirrored that.

now, they must be much more chilled out about things and so therefore, I again mirror that too.

I'm not trying to figure out how to get to the manifestation/conditions that I think will make me feel good. instead, I'm getting better at perceiving my present situation in a way that feels good.

this is also being mirrored in other things around the subject of science. I noticed last night that there are two extremes that are notable. one is how rapidly something oscillates (the frequency) and the other is the amplitude. take a galaxy for example. the wavelength is millions of lightyears in time length. it's amplitude is also millions of lightyears in distance. however, at the same time that a galaxy has produces frequencies that are faster than gamma waves (this I believe is what allows elements to exist). those amplitudes are not likely very high.

so, when it comes to science, I personally prefer the most simple most rapid high frequency form of perception (this is my these high frequency waves being the carrier wave for all elements). however, there are other branches of science that prefer the most complicated form of explanation. this is perfectly fine. I don't have any resistance to the idea that someone else perfers the complicated.

I think of this like going on a walk. you could go on a walk, and if you only traveled a planck distance from the chair, I could take a zillion walks a second, but not get very much satisfaction out of any of them. to really get a good walk in, I want to travel a long distance before returning home. you could say the universe does this every (pick a number) billion years. that's a really long walk.

so, when I think of this in the bigger scheme of life, consider that I was hitler for a moment. I think of this like the step leaders from lightning. those are different attempts that appear to be useless, but I would guess that if someone did the math on it, each step leader is like a correction for the next ones to get closer to the destination. the lightning rod is attracting a bunch of electrons back home, but it has to find its way back. each attempt gets closer and closer. the bigger the distance, the bigger the potential.

so often, I want to tell people trying to direct my path, "just let me go my own way for a while. even if you think it's not the right way, let me do the course correction and find my way toward where I want to go."

in the bigger picture of things, a timeline in the life of hitler would just give me a better sense of direction.

there really is no good or evil; it's all attraction.


### 2021-10-08 16:17 - cow guy vs elephant guy

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDWxLxh6dWQ)

when watching this guy's videos on indian temples, I noticed a few things. first of all, the process that's used is a subtractive process. they start with a giant solid peice of stone, then carve out the basic shapes, often into rough or blocky sections to get the basic shape, then removing more and more matter to create finer and finer detail. interestingly virtually all of these temples, I can identify parts that are not quite finished. all over, it seems to me like there were thousands of people working on these temples all over the place, and then all of a sudden somebody cut off the power.

the other thing I notice is similar to the inca in that there are also constructions made of brick and mortar built in the same style. if they had the capacity to remove stone with such relative ease, why did they all stop so suddenly? I belive the stone temples are a lot older.

---

looking at the symbols in the carvings, I notice a few progressions. there is a cow guy and also an elephant guy that are often depicted there.

I think they are the same guy, and there was a bit of a decision which timeline to take. it appears that cow guy won.

I postulate that the announced of the next era symbolically appears to people as a symbol representing the era that is one ahead[^1]. so, for example, in taurus after some event a fish guy shows up to people all over the planet and brings civilisation and farming techniques.

the other really visible one that directly mirrors this is the notable confict in people's perception whether he was the son of man (the aquarian man) or the lion of judah (leo). it states very specifically that he was the stone that the builders rejected, and so therefore cannot be the lion of judah. if he were the lion of judah, then it would appear our trajectory would be toward leo.

what this all amounts to is that these two conflicting symbols create a split in perception and something dramatic happens as a result. I believe it likely that these carvings would be from a time around 6-8kya at the end of saggitarius.

interestingly, I think this was about the time that the great pyramid broke. that may have been the power source for all of these temples. additionally, I find it interesting that there are two major styles of constructing things -- the addative process, and the subtractive process. pre-dynastic egypt has a very interesting mix of these two. on one side you have these massive pyramids built with the addative process (cutting, stacking, and arranging blocks) while at the centre there are these stone boxes and obelisks which are created using the subtractive process. start with a single piece of stone and then remove material until the resonant dimensions are created.

---

I roughly put the zodiac axis as going between the galactic centre and taurus (aldebaron?). the left side of the zodiac I consider to be the masculine side. I also notice that the upper half has seems to be different as well. for example, though the left is masculine, there is a difference between the upper half and the lower half. in the upper half, there is where you have the stories of the amazonas. consider the upper half to be something more of a matriarchy and the lower to be more of a patriarchy.

during the time these temples were being carved, there was a lot of goddess worship and "divine feminine" energy present. I find it likely that the majority of the carvings (if not all) were done by girls. they must be doing most of the carvings with their mental energy (maybe channeled through a copper instrument) and so then if that's the case, these carvings would be a sort of insight into their outlook. 

they seem to have a whole different perspective on things, in that it appears that there is an iterative process that they're taking to decorating these temples. it seems also that they're quite scattered, leaving a part doing another idea they have, then coming back to it later. it definitely looks like they're going around just working on whatever "tickles their fancy" -- not too dissimilar to the way I do things[^2]. it's this idea of only working on the things that interest you and that you want to do. this keeps things interesting and avoids burnout because you're only working on the things that interest you. this is the opposite perspective of having some top-down mandated list of tasks that needs to be accomplished.

---

this appears to me to be somewhat similar to what is beginning to take place today. yesterday, when I woke up, I had a lot of things in my mind that gave me the impression that we were going to aquarius. it seems like the plan is to get a number of things in place that will keep energies from getting out of control.

I believe that this time, it will be exactly the opposite of the last time. this time we're going toward sirius, not away.. and so the structure that's being built to keep energies balanced has the opposite goal. since energies are rising, this structure will be used more to prevent anyone from having too much of an effect on the planet. it's a bit of a thing to solve. consider for a moment how large of an effect I have on the planet. it's because I have such a strong emotional capacity. the more I feel, the more I attract a reality.

I have this theory that there is a "probability management group" that has invested a lot of time and resources into ensuring that there are no improbable circemstances that take place. I notice this happening all the time when I'm playing hearthstone. if I start feeling too good (doesn't matter if I'm winning or not), it seems like there is effort to put bad-feeling thoughts into my head to ensure that I don't feel too good. I've noticed that if I take a very stable and consistent feeling, never feeling too good or too bad, then I seem to be better. however, the minute I start feeling really bad (and my wins are low), then miraculous events start happening in my favour. likewise, if I start feeling too good (and my wins are not low), then it seems like the opponent gets these ridiculous things. I think mattchmaking has more to do with feels than it has to do with MMR at this point (at least in my case).

this isn't the only place that I notice this effect. for example, if I'm joking with jaron for breakfast and I'm feeling pretty good, something will happen (mom comes down or dramatic subject change) which will try and normalise the feels. likewise, if I plunge head-first into a bad-feeling topic with jaron (or at the harbor or whatever), again there seems to be a tremendous amount of effort that is taken to try and neutralise this. someone will interrupt me, change the subject or whatever. from my perspective. from my perspective, this appears to me like a bunch of people turn into agent smith whenever things are getting "off track".

I think there is considerable effort that has been taken to ensure that feels are maintained at a certain level. so if you find a way to feel really good, then there must be a relatively equal amount of bad feeling. some people are getting on these roller-coasters that are going WAYYY up and then coming WAYYY down later.

my goal is not to try and see how long I can sustain a good feeling, but instead "keep it in the centre" -- never feeling too good or too bad either. I oscillate there and stay pretty consistent now. what that allows me to do is to feel pretty good emotionally, though physically things are pretty drab.

this capacity to feel emotion so consistently means that the moment that I start to feel good physically, I begin to "cross over to the other side".

I think that my goal is not to cross over anytime soon. I think I want to allow them to get their full system into place. this is the next great pyramid like system that will completely regulate all of our experiences so that we don't ever have too many experiences that feel too good (and therefore have too noticable of an impact on the planet). this system I think will continue to expand out to include automatic manipulation of a person's timeline so that they never feel too good (much like how it is for me now).

---

so, this is just a temporary detour. eventually in 6ky, there will be another elephant man vs cow man episode, and if they want to remain in the masculine side of things, the machine will have to break and the world turn over again to get back down to taurus. or, keep the machine and go to libra. so, in the bigger scheme of things, it all works out. this is so far into the future, none of us will see this, so it's not even worth it to worry about it. they want to kick the can down the road a little further and I'm totally fine with that. it gives me a whole lot more of an opportuninty to keep doing what I do which is to find a way to feel good no matter the circumstances.

now, from my perspective this appears to be quite desirable. they have to try and figure out how to keep me physically focused for as long as possible. what that means is feeling sensation as a physical manifestation rather than an emotion. their machine will be able to control physical manifestations (the way you feel physically when you feel good), which because it's a much stronger signal can easily drown out the way you really feel.

the sense that I had when waking up was that they wanted to keep me as far away from being able to feel that physical/conceptual feeling. to describe this difference, I'd like to use an example. when I create something I am not at all like tesla, in that I usually don't have the final result idea in my head. most of the time, I have no idea what the final result will look like or any of its implementation aspects. I just have an idea of how it will feel. as I go, I get an idea which leads me to a thing which makes the creation feel more like how I want it to feel. if I get stuck too much on a difficult spot, I start to feel the difficulty which creates more difficulty. I then have to take a break and get back to how the creation feels, not the difficulty feels. when I do that I typically can see where the bug is or know the solution -- and it's because I can feel the created thing.

extend that out a bit further and notice that the stronger I can feel something becoming a reality (without noticing the reality of its present state), then the faster the creation manifests. 

going back to the creation of these temples, it appears that there are multiple phases. the first is that the rough or blocky shape is created. this has sharp edges, and then those sharp edges are refined and smoothed out until they are smooth and perfect. I don't know who made the blocky shapes that were then intricately detailed, but personally, I don't see intricate details. I see blocky shapes that have a function, design, meaning, or purpose. later, when the details are added, they give it a unique and specific feel that the artist imbues into it.

mental disturbances. I'll come back to this later.

---

anyway, it seems obvious to me that eventually I'll make my transition and have to start over again. it seems obvious to me that this time and in future lives, they'll have to keep me constantly distracted with shiny fun physical things. this will, in this sense, be another week of lovemaking for enkidu (symbolically speaking). what I mean is that I'll continue to find more and more ways to optimise my experience so that emotion is what I perceive to be real and more significant than the physical.

it appears to me to be like a really unique challenge that I don't think many will understand. they'll just see a mix of seemingly "good" physical manifestations, and I'm appearing to have less and less of a reaction to them the whole time. I'm optimising out the roller-coaster so that I can oscillate more and more rapidly around the centre. this is a pretty good stability platform for someone who wants to try and see how long they they can experience only good-feeling manifestations.

this reminds me very much of the galaxy, with wavelengths hundreds of thousands of light years across, while also emitting a (magnetic?) carrier wave outward at such a high frequency that it maintains the existance of physical elements.

pretty cool, I guess.

[1]: the one that I can't really figure out is that there had to have been someone in scorpio that symbolically appeared as a ram which brought us into taurus (khnum?). I get the sense that this may be connected to the mithras cult which was the roman version. though, now that I think of it, mithras may have been in aries (having slayed the bull), so he is the first prototype for the aquarian man. this may have something to do with the ophiuchus guy that mathisson talks about. dunno these all so well. I'd love to figure this out better.

[2]: it also reminds me of the way andreas approaches creating tasks for SerenityOS.

### 2021-10-08 ??:?? - redefinition of the zone
### 2021-10-09 05:56 - theory for the origin of the longheads

I've often been fasccinated by the longheads (18th dynasty, paracas, caspian sea). they are this enigmatic peaceful civilsation that appears out of nowhere in history, and then they just get run over by these aggressive factions [watching curtis' docementary series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj84EeXAeMI&list=PLu4Nza39ZZYWXv2cwsmlK9VZ4Neb7msYi), I started to really explore this idea because the 18th dynasty is this strange thing that happens when all of a sudden the amun priesthood is abolished by some longheads, and replaced with "atem" -- which, I don't think is monotheiesm, but the idea that there is this "aten" energy present in everything and it is radiated outward most predominantly from the sun.

this idea that the source is present in everyone would be extremely unpopular to a priesthood with the economic strength founded on the fear of death and one's capacity to enter the afterlife. if everyone has built-in access to this "aten" source ("the sun gives warmth to the just and unjust alike") then, there's no need for a priesthood. they're not the sales middleman helping you to get into the afterlife.

you can see how that would be perceived as a pretty big threat to them. btw, these priests are seen throughout history attempting to prevent humans from realising that we are eternal beings in a physical body. they can only sell you something you already have, if you're convinced you don't have it or are scared that only some elite few have access to it...

however, I believe that whole establishing of the amarna and aten was a distraction to hide what was really happening.

---

there are three major colour groups that is written about by moses as the "sons of noah". we all know that the noah story (and the reed basket on the nile) is directly lifted from the akkadians, so we know that moses is talking about the younger dryas, and the three sons of noah are three population groups that he is identifying.

- shem: (red) these are the atlantians, semites, gilgamesh, the ones originating from mars. they seem to be the progenitors of the babylonians, akkadians, etc.
- ham: (black) these are the khemit, the original goddess worshipping inhabitants. nubians, kush, etc.
- japheth: (white) these are the cro magnon, adamites, the sons of man, enkidu, etc. the new breed of hybrid humans built by mixing the red ones with primates.

so it seems that these are the original warring factions in egypt. in upper (southern) egypt, they hae the white crown, and osiris is always seen wearing the crown, plus the feathers. the north part of egypt, cairo, the subduer mars is the red part and they invade south egypt. those two hats are interesting, but then I noticed another hat show up. it's blue and it looks like a longhead, the "khepresh". it's weird because I see this crown also making its debut in the 18th dynasty. I will now associate blue with the longheads.

it's also interesting to note the crown starts with "kh" -- a prefix for khemet, knum, (and I think also associated with akhet, sekhmet). the letter k is an interesting one... just saying.

as an another interesting sidenote, I also notice that often times osiris, khnum, and sobek are depicted as having green skin. I think this is another association with those that bring green (water, rain, lush), as opposed to the god of the desert and chaos, set -- the enemy that osiris fought, and produced horus. I also associate horus as the egyptian version of enkidu. anyway, I think there may be a relation between these green martians and perhaps the viracocha/quetokoatl are all different cultures interpretations of the same thing. they knew how to make things green...

---

anyway, now on to the theory of the longheads: I think they were a genetic upgrade for humankind. just as I believe the spacecraft in area 51 was designed to be shot down and reverse engineered, I think the longheads were designed to be conquered and get their genetics introduced into the gene pool.

when I watched curtis' [documentary on nefertari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEr1vWsobDw), I had the sense that ramses "usurped" so many statues of so many things that were clearly not built by him, because he actually believed himself to be the reincarnation of the people in the the statues that he usurped. I also had this sense that he held nefertari to be the source of his perception. he says in a poem to her "the one for whom the sun doth shine" (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe5iTs4INFQ)) -- an image very invoking of the aten imagery with the rays (of the sun/aten) decending.

I think the [amarna tomb 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarna_Tomb_1) tells the story visually. the main players are nefertiti, tiye, akhenaten and his daughter, [beketaten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beketaten) (meaning handmaid of aten).

```
The Lintel on the North Wall shows a depiction of the two royal families. On the left hand side Akhenaten and Nefertiti are shown seated. Nefertiti turns toward Akhenaten. Before them four royal daughters are shown: Meritaten, Meketaten, Ankhesenpaaten and Neferneferuaten Tasherit. All four girls are holding plume shaped wands. On the right side Amenhotep III is shown seated opposite Queen Tiye who is accompanied by the princess Baketaten. Three female attendants are shown behind Tiye.
```

this is showing that "aten" is being transferred from one royal family to another -- IMO, from akhenaten and nefertiti (who's father is ay?) to amenhotep III -- through queen tiye (passing through the daughter baketaten).

I made this realisation when I started to look at the statue of queen tuya in the vatican. [on their page](https://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/collezioni/musei/museo-gregoriano-egizio/sala-v--statuario/statua-della-regina-tuia.html), they say:

```
This work, sculpted during Dynasty XVIII with the features of Queen Tiye, wife of Amenhotep III, was “usurped” and reused during the Dynasty XIX by Ramesses II, who dedicated it to his mother Tuya. This queen, who had an important political and court role, received after her death a funerary cult associated with that of her son in the so-called Ramesseum, the burial site of Ramesses situated in West Thebes, where this statue would originally have been erected.
On the left side of the dorsal pillar the princess Henutmire is depicted, described in the brief inscription as the “royal daughter” or the “royal wife”. Considered in the past to have been one of the daughters of Ramesses II, Henutmire has now been identified as one of the pharaoh’s sisters, possibly the daughter of the same father Seti I. Her statue would have been brought to Rome and placed in the “Gardens of Sallust” of the emperor Caligula, along with the statues of Ptolemy II, Arsinoë II and Drusilla-Arsinoë.
```

---

ramses was red haired (eg. white), and was also born in the hyxsos capital of avara, so he must have been on the amun priesthood's radar. he was cunning and knew to let them have their silly priesthood and to just keep quiet about the things. I think ramses knew this but couldn't say anything. learning from the amarna fail that trying to push against the amun priesthood isn't a good idea, I find it very likely that rameses II knew this and left these clues behind telling people that he knew what was up.

also, strangely enough, hollywood has depicted queen tiye as the adopting mother of moses. since moses clearly preddates her by a lot, this seems to be an intentional mistake. she has the famous line, "Bithiah could charm tears from a crocodile" -- which is likely a reference to sobek a green skinned crocodile, which also makes an appearance in nefertari's tomb.

that's my theory so far, but someone in hollywood must also know something about this... for sure :)

### 2021-10-09 16:39 - khnum's event, moses, the colour blue, and the enkidu's second week of lovemaking

one of the reactions that I had was wondering about noah's event. I think that there was an event that happenned roughly 5-6kya but I don't think that it was noah's flood. noah's flood must be referring to the younger dryas period ~12kya, because that is the flood myth that utnapishtim is the star of. he tells the same story, but instead of using the god enki as the protagonist for the humans, I believe that moses was referring to aten as YHVH (source). that would have been the maverick version but then got custodialised.

before we get into that, I just want to say that moses was the slayer of the cow (taurus) and so therefore would have the symbol of aquarius which may be why he has the story of YHVH punishing moses for striking the stone instead of speaking to it. assuming that the stone always symbolises the current paradigm, this is likely a reference to moses having the symbol of the aquarian man, and using force (eg. the exodus) instead of speaking with the rock.

khnum however I believe has the correct symbols for this event 6kya. we know that the reboot of egypt covilisation started with a lot of cow goddess worship. I think goddess worship would have been retained from the end of saggitarius. so, right as we get to the sun rising with the galactic centre something major happens roughly 6kya that puts us at the beginning of taurus. I believe this was a solar outburst produced by increasingly incompatible realities.

at that time, the star sirius is beginning to go from red to white. the goddess divine feminine "hunter gatherer" culture was in full swing and the shepherd kings were begginning to not want to have to depend on females anymore for their perception. sirius is no longer in the waning phase so energies are beginning to rise up again. they wanted a male-dominated society, but not a lot of people were wanting to change.

I think this was causing an escallating amount of war and division. "we want to do it our way (and not have to depend on the girls)" almost certainly was their ethos at that time. these incompatible realities are, I believe the source of extreme solar activity. I think khnum was also from mars but he was one of the ones on enki's side of things (hence the green skin). I find it likely that he or ptah created the great pyramid to maintain stability for long enough time for the adam/enkidu to repopulate the earth. this time from capricorn to saggitarius is what I'm calling the week (6ky) of lovemaking that enkidu went through to begin to become civilised.

further, khnum has the ram's head meaning he has the symbol of the following era. so, if we're in the end of saggitarius, and he's perceived as a ram, that means in 2ky, we're entering into picsis.

---

jumping back to the 18th dynasty, I these longheads were a return back to the osirian way of doing things (goddess worship) and they must have had some mental capabilites that angered the amun priesthood. they are selling a bunch of potions, perfumes, and other useless stuff. they must have had psychic and telekinesis capabilities. I believe that these "superpowers" were the genetic upgrade that they added.

also during this time sirius is now beginning to transition from white to blue as well. this is conjecture, but blue was not a colour that people could see in ancient antiquity. this (re?)discovery of the colour blue must have been significant -- a sort of sign of a coming new golden age.

---

what may actually be the case for moses is that actually the exodus was getting the goddess worshipping aten priesthood out of egypt. there is this thing with aaron and the cow statue. this is highly symbolic because it's presumed that venus was causing havoc in the solar system and so when moses got angry with them for going back to hathor worship (aaron was supposedly a priest in the temple of hathor). this event is symbolically saying, "no the goddess worship is done. we're doing it our own way now."

there is some ideas that the ark of the covenant was an item that used to be in the great pyramid and that was what was removed. there is also this strange thing with the isreal flag being the star of david in blue and white. this, to me is symbolic of the breaking away from the red atlantian oppression.

again, I think that originally moses was a maverick but the latest ufo custodians (eg. germans) severly distorted the timeline and through illusion they took over the YHVH role, giving them signs and wonders for them to marvel at so that they could believe that YHVH was the true god for them to serve.

the colurs of blue and white tell me that they were leaving behind (running away from) unwanted, but LOA works in such a way that you cannot fight against something and expect it not to follow you. you're only fighting yourself and your own perception. well, it turns out that YHVH is a whole lot like the amun priesthood.

for as long as they continue to need the manifestation to be able to believe it, then they will forever be duped by any sales person coming with a nice sounding imagery and a "good" message.

---

in the previouus entry, I made the mistake of confusing moses with senmut/joseph when I said that tiye predated moses. I am now of the opinion that may have been put into there actually to illustrate that moses actually had this longhead divine feminine in his genetics. I think this is important because having this genetic upgrade allows one greater psychic capabilities if it's unlocked.

this lineage must be important that it's tracable to moses. if israel was the sole contributer to improved genetics, then ismael and the arab population as a whole would have this capabilitiy. I think it's the blue and the white that's so important.

white (I think sepehr says this is loosly r1a) and red (I think sepehr said this is r1b) have been battling for quite a while now and are quite intermixed. the statue of queen tuya being venerated since the time of caligula means that they must know about the importance of this blue influnce.

this brings us to the significance of the nazi party. when the aryan (white) revolution begins, they have the flag of red (mars), white (aryan), and a black (khem) swastika, which symbolises the change of the age and a major event which will change the direction of the sun. the romans has the sybil prophecy of the coming start of the golden age and a return back to the goddess and saturnian times -- and here are the nazi's that are saying they're white, but behaving like the reds and forcing a change of age.

for the blue and whites, this would appear to be a total disaster.

---

what I think all of this amounts to is that originally the semites believed a story of enkidu spending a week leaving his animal nature behind, but then the conditions of earth (distance to sirius) allowed people to return back to their animal nature quite easily. this transformed and a series of timeline edits by the aryan custodians caused the "lion of judah" to be missed. instead, now enkidu (humankind) has to go back for another week (6ky) of lovemaking again.

I guess the sybil's prophecy for the roman empire was actually correct. perhaps it's one of those pygmalian effects, I suppose.

I think I was trying to hit as many racial tropes as I can in this one. lol...

### 2021-10-11 11:28 - quick update, I guess

I sometimes dislike writing these because I feel like I'm just repeating myself so many times... the concepts are probably useful for them to try and block them, so in the interest of getting more practise, here goes...

the last few days, especially after writing those crazy theories, I felt attraction to want to go into the snake-force discord. that idea came to me and it felt good, but then later there was a lot of chaos around the idea.

the reality is, I don't really want to be public yet. I enjoy the quiet capability of just doing things at my own pace here. it is true that I do want to have some people shoot down some of my crazy ideas, as that often times fuels me to find out more. however, there is a niceness to the solo effort.

I really am optimised for self-discovery. I don't really know how to work with other people anyway. all of my life, I've never gotten too far telling people my ideas. like, if I were to bring up some ideas to dani or to daniel, they would always be met with difficulty. I prefer to expand my ideas by myself. I'm really not afraid to get things wrong. I've almost certainly got a whole bunch of stuff wrong.

also, my ideas are so far out there that it's really difficult to try even be on the same ... like, for example, I was watching another matthew la croix podcast and they were talking about stuff and I get it -- but I feel there is such a huge difference between our perceptions still. they're identifying a lot of conditions and stuff still and I get that some things are better than others, but I'm looking at things a whole new way now: I don't see good or bad anymore.

I've sort of begun a whole new form of perception where I see perception now. like, I started out seeing a lot of conditions, but then I stopped seeing conditions and trained my heart to *feel* the way I wanted to feel, despite whatever signals my brain is telling me. this made it so that I could think something in my mind, feel something in my stomach, but something entirely differently in my heart. I gained a lot of stability that way. not a whole lot bothers my anymore.

in fact so few things bother me now that I feel extremely comfortable just doing what I'm doing. there's no reason to try and feel better or to feel worse. I'm just getting really good at this stuff. there are tons of small things that are now apparent to me which were previously unperceived -- like it seems that I have some sort of forward looking dejavu..

before I get into that, I want to finish my previous thought. first I saw condintions and instead of just unconsciously reacting to them, I gained the ability to notice that something doesn't feel good to me. I called them interrupts. then, I started to distinguish what the difference between my own bad-feeling and a bad feeling coming from an external source.

after that I really began to consciously find new ways ways to perceive the same thing in another way which feels good. while doing that, I really began to learn the difference between origin of perception (focus) -- like from what vantage point am I looking at it from -- like, my own, a group's, the planet's, the solar system, etc.

now, that I'm getting that pretty well down, I'm perceiving perception. I have begun to notice a lot how other people perceive the same thing. I first started to really notice how different circumstances in mr. motor's life would cause him to come to conclusions about things like why he never wants to feel good or why he thinks that everyone is out to dupe him. the simple answer is that it's all a reflection, and we are really all only fighting ourselves.

reality is like the dual of our perception, and this allows me to perceive perception now. it's as if the whole thing makes logical sense to me now. the best way to describe this sensation would be something like implications, but more like feeling/perception implications instead of facts and data implications.

---

ok, going back to the deja vu thing. I was listening to @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0pkZjiJq4), and in it russ is talking about how he can feel the deja vu and it's this recognition of something familiar, but he can't sense what's coming next. I can't either, but I noticed that I do have new beginning sense where it feels like I can *feel* what is coming next. I don't know what is coming next. I have had premonition where I *know* what is coming. I also sometimes have a sense of what is coming -- like a forboding -- but this is a bit different.

it's still in it's very infant stages, so the feeling is still quite faint, but I would describe it something like how I experience music in an altered (stoned, etc) or quiet state. the music feels vibrant and more tangible. I don't know what is coming next, but the passage of the music feels so satifying. reality is becoming a landscape of sensation -- though more like concept. I can see the rolling hills in the distance, but everywhere that I am now feels different than out there.

listing to music when I'm stoned, for example, I don't know what's coming next -- instead it feels novel and unique (even if I've heard the song many times before). it's only possible because my perception is becoming so fluid.

---

ok, so here's the only subject remaining, and it's another repeat. when it comes to the subject of girls, I have this serious flip-flopping action going on. mostly I find the whole thing so overwhelming that I don't really want to do anything. I'm going through such a radical transformation mentally that I find all of that completely unnecessary. obviously, I want to try and delay for as long as possible.

I think there are countless timelines where I find my connection with the girls. there are not likely very many where I find it without them.

I realise this kind of creates a bit of an issue because if I'm coming into the relationsship from a position of inferiority, then I work my way toward the goal with other people and we accomplish it together.

I'm most optimal when I'm by myself though. I want to find my own perception, not hers. I want to figure it out for me. I got to the place that I'm at now being "selfish". I really like the idea of doing it all my own way.

what I mean is this... imagine I'm running a marathon and some guy keeps asking me if I want a ride. I tell him no a bunch of times. I get right up to the finish line 10 metres away and decide to jump in the van and cross the finish line in the van. doesn't that seem weird?

it's a pretty bad example though, but I don't know how to describe it. just, the idea of trying to figure out how to interact with some girls or one girl feels about as stressful(?) -- un poco coñazo. I just don't want to have to deal with others' perception yet. I'm just starting to get used to the idea that my own perception is fluid. adding other variables into the equation feels like it's complicating things. I don't want to have to try and integrate someone else's. I really want to get good at this.

it's like asking an achemist who just discovered how to make gold, if he wants a job.

---

as a slight sidenote, yesterday I felt a desire to want to go out to the front of the house, but I ignored it. then, I felt a desire to want go to the side-yard and see the moon's relation to venus. when I did, I saw remi's car, and I had a noticable reaction to even the thought of trying to talk to her.

in a recent entry, I talked about how instead of just being guided by feelings, I should follow desire and just find a way to feel good about the same thing. so, I should have paused, rearranged my mind to want to talk and then went out to the front, right? I mean, that is what I supposed I should do -- start to follow through on all of those ideas that felt good to me.

the thing is, there really isn't any reason to talk to her. I don't have anything to say anyway. if I wanted to talk, I'd join the skake-bros discord, but I don't want to really talk. I enjoy the stability of doing nothing. when I have significant control over my reality, I'll be more congenial.

---

(all the pictures, inside my head)

there's another huge problem that really makes me want to interact with others as well. I get a lot of really offensive/uncool images and thoughts popping into my head. I really am a huge problem. I don't really want to deal with that stuff. like, it's almost as if people's insecurities pop into my head, and whether they're visual or thoughts doesn't matter. they are really problematic.

there was this thing that I really dislike when I'm around people -- and it's as if they feel they need to prove to me their insecurities are valid.

I receive people's insecuries because I too have my own insecurities. the more my perception becomes fluid, the more I notice how other people perceive me. oviously, there's not a lot I can do about anything anyone perceives about me, so the fact that it feels bad is obvious evidence that I have that perception wrong.

---

next topic is the idea of whether there will or won't be a cataclysm or not. I don't think there will be -- at least not from my perspective. if there are people that think there will be one, then that means there is desire to go back and sabotage this timeline. I find that basically 100% probable, so yes there will be, but also no there won't be. if you need a cataclysm, it's coming. you're already on that timeline. I just need to get to a point where that timeline becomes desirable to me again.

---

next topic is that it feels like there are two groups forming. there is one group that wants to use technology to create the required conditions for the desired manifestation. the other group is the one that I'm in.

neither group will experience a cataclysm, and that's fine. that's not the problem. the problem is the idea of there being a group. man, I just want to go at it myself.

so, like take the cultures idea, and it requires that a whole bunch of me's are there doing stuff. if I'm connected, then I believe I will outsource that to another me. if I'm not, then I don't want to do it. see what I mean?

so, you could say that my not wanting to do it is rooted in others' perception of me, but it's not really that. let's just say it is though. what I need to do then is to find a way to no longer perceive others' perception of me. that's what I'm doing right now, and when I get there I'll be connected.

so it's sort of like saying, "I don't want to get there until I'm there". what I'm saying is that when I'm ready for the group, I'm also ready for many groups. there's no difference. my connection, in that sense, is inevitable, and once I'm connected, then as many groups can form as want to form. there isn't a limit. I am now a sort of species rather than an individual person. I'll be able to move my perception around between parts just like I can't continue to breathe naturally when I focus my attention to my breathing.

fluidity of perception.

---

I really am learning very fast, and I believe I'll have all of this down pretty well very soon. the rest, I'll learn as I go.

I would say that right now the trajectory I'm on is that I'm just going to keep getting better and better at what I'm doing. eventually, I'll get connected. I don't have any idea what that feels like, so I can't really say what that'll be like.

we'll just have to see how it goes. nosebook could let go if they wanted to. they don't want to though, so I'm just going to keep going.

### 2021-10-11 19:58 - the aquarian way

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_X8O3_MlWc)

I woke up this evening with an interesting idea in my mind. you know that one entry where I wrote about cow guy vs elephant guy (@[newblog](2021-10-08 16:17))? the whole premise of that was to explain that I am a construct of your perception. I reflect (and so therefore we take the timeline) that matches that perception.

I was meaning that to kind of say, choose how you see me. do I appear like a goat or a crab?

the other day I woke up thinking about structure of entities. a crab or a turtle has it's structure on the outside (probably for protection). a crab does, but I had turtles when I was younger and they're very fragile. rigid structures can only take repeated impacts on the same place if the structure is harder that the impact; otherwise, there's damage to the structural integrity.

in an organisational structure, I've found that rigid structures are very fragile and they become slow too, kind of like a turtle in that it takes a lot of effort to carry around such a rigid protective structure. there's a reason why our bones are on the inside of our body. snakes and octopi don't really have structure and I prefer this model much more for an organisation than a rigid one. in general, the lighter the structure, the more agile it is, but also the more fragile.

a crab is literally the opposite of what I want to do. in that sense, I'm much more of a goat than a crab.

---

each set of symbols has an opposite and also is part of a progression. consider the way that I believe that the last time things happened like this. there is a cataclysm at the end of lion, and we find ourselves in goat. this is all about the feminine side nurturing the masculine side. the goat is all about doing things his way. in order to do something one's own way, there has to be a group paradigm that one has to reject.

there are two very interesting zones of two amounts of heating in the greenland oxygen isotopes (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/G0Cp7DrvNLQ?t=2883)), which I think corresponds to basically the time in leo things warm up considerably. that was the hight of the atlantian civilisation, then things happen and we find ourselves in capricorn. humans get this "rebellous" idea that we're going to do it our way and build a big tower to reestablish the energetic conditions on earth again. again temperature rises there again, but then the tower is destroyed. I don't think the world turned over that time -- just minor stuff like a huge rise in sea level and stuff like that.

this may be why there is such a huge scare happening around the global warming thing -- because someone knows somewhere that when energies are higher, then our thoughts carry more power and things manifest more rapidly.

---

ok, so getting back to the progression thing here. to me, it's clear that aquarius is all about going with the flow of things. leo however is all about showing everyone who's boss and the expression of selfishness from within the group. lions are very different cats from our small cats. I don't believe that our domestic cats organise into groups too much. the lion's "pride" is much more symbolically relevant to the "cultures" idea, with each culture being more similar to a pride.

keep that in mind as we imagine the last time we were there. previous to that was virgo which is the self improvement of one's feminine side by their feminine side. so, the lion appears as a very dramatic change.

or, imagine how different of a mindset it is for us to go from picsis into aquarius. aquarius is all about going with the flow. to understand, look at it as the opposite of leo. instead of selfish expression in a group, it's instead about individual expression while going with the flow. so imagine that you're on a giant river. you learn to navigate on top of the river rather than trying to change the course of the river.

this is the capacity that I have accomplished and is why I consider myself to be a sort of symbol of the aquarian man. that is also the ojective of the game I want to create. I think it's also the same as the teachings of the tao and perhaps some hindu teachings as well.

in the end, I'm just sort of going with the flow of things. I personally don't care how you guys choose to perceive me, as I don't really care.

---

let's just say that I retain the image of the goat, which will take us to aquarius. that means that the "stone" that is left behind is the piscean group-think mentality. there are certainly those that want to be in control of that. humankind's objective will then be to learn how to go with the flow because it's sort of like how I am now. I didn't get to the place I'm at now by fighting them. I just learned to go with the flow and find a way to perceive the dangerous rapids and sharp rocks as something fun and enjoyable, rather than something fearful or dangerous.

so, looking at it from that perspective, things are defininitely looking pretty aquarian. what that means is that I have the imazge of the goat. I'm doing things my way -- and it may end up with meltwater pulse 1b as a result. not my problem :)

---

it feels to me that the direction that we're going is toward aquarius. there are a lot of efforts by a lot of people to ensure that all of us are put into a situation similar to the one that I'm in right now, where I don't have the economic control to get the conditions that I want (eg. great reset) -- thereby forcing humankind to begin to go with the flow and not fight it. your success is a result of your perception, not all of the people you defeated along the way get there.

I mentioned two groups, and in that sense, the group that I'm in is actually more the aquarian group. the group that the techno-manifesters are in is much more the lion group, actually. they are not wanting to go with the flow. they want to get a bunch of people and use intention and other powerful forms of attraction to create the reality that they want.

so, I guess it's kind of a bit of both as the ones wanting to go to aquaman are acting like lions, and the lions are being forced to go with the flow.

---

now, let's look at the crab. crab is opposite the goat. it's all about internalising and protecting. it's the masculine side nurturing and protecting the feminine so that it gets a chance to grow up.

the symbol following that one is the twins. this is a major change because now these two forces have to be separated again. they can no longer be unified in the same rigid structure. even though they appear similar now, they must now learn to operate separately and become their own person.

---

maybe you can try to figure out how to make it both. this ties into the "tale of two earths" idea, that we're divided by time rather than by space. there are some symbolic hurdles though.

### 2021-10-12 03:32 - a bit of a followup

#### did I mean that I'm stuck sabotaging timelines for as long as people still want a cataclysm?

yes, I think that is how time works. they will experience the sabotaged timeline directly, even if I only tune into it at a later time.

thinking on that creates a huge problem because of a perception of linear time. if I go and do say hundreds of years in a timeline, then go back to tune into the timeline, were those people waiting for me to show up? or, was it something like sleep, where you only assume that the place you wake up in is the same place that you left behind and only the difference in the hours that changed on the clock has passed. in reality thousands of years could have passed in that 8hr time that I was asleep. it only appears like those two time segments are connected, when in reality they are not.

then, the second problem that it creates is if I go back and I alter the timeline to sabotage it worse than the one that people already perceived, or is the one that they perceived the one that I sabotaged? which one did they see? then, who is me? what I mean is, if I'm source having a physical experience, why do I see this timeline? what is it that makes this reality the desired one to be perceived?

surely I cannot go back and force someone else to perceive a different timeline if it's only attraction.

maybe then, the other people in the altered version of the timeline are also me? it would seem that way, and the fact that I am perceiving this timeline means that it is the one that I (source) most desires to perceive.

it's kind of crazy to think about, so I'll stop there.

#### what did I mean about finding a way to feel good about conversing with remi?

I also had a small desire to go on to the snake-bros discord but then later it was turned into chaos and stopped feeling so good. this is the same event. I had a feeling that I wanted to go look at the moon's relation to venus, then upon seeing remi's car, I suddenly felt as if I didn't want to go any further.

same event; different people. so, why then don't I find a way to feel good about talking with people on the discord? because I don't want to. I want to go my own way. I don't want to jump in the van 10 metres from the finish line.

#### more about crabs

the change in my symbolism from crab to symbolism is likely a recent change. I believe I contained a lot of the crab symbolism because that is what I did with my left-side after the haemorrhage. I had to protect, nurture, and care for my left side. because it behaves so much more differently than my right side, I had to learn a lot and we had to learn to work together to create the things that I wanted to make.

this is not how I am today, at all. my left-side is very disabled and I'm very much right-sided. I don't have interest in working together with anyone. I want to go my own way and stuff. I'm definitely the goat.

#### a new way to look at the zodiac

as I have been paying attention to the zodiac, I have noticed that people have noticed that I see the zodiac very differently than others do. I want to get more of it down soon, but here's a preview because it's relevant to the previous section.

it appears to me that each of the four quadrants have four triads in them. two MMF and two MFF. each gender is ruled by the opposite gender. the top left one is MMF. the two boys are aquaman and goat. these represent the two extremes of male tendency. one is "go with the flow" (aquaman) and the other one is "I'm doin it my way" (goat). the reason why I intro'd the last entry with the "american way" is because that very much is the theme of the USA. whether it's colombus and the crypto jews or the breakaway british colonies or tesla's trek to the land of dreams:

> I wish that I could put in words my first impressions of this country. In the Arabian Tales I read how genii transported people into a land of dreams to live thru delightful adventures. My case was just the reverse. The genii had carried me from a world of dreams into one of realities. What I had left was beautiful, artistic and fascinating in every way; what I saw here was machined, rough and unattractive. A burly policeman was twirling his stick which looked to me as big as a log. I approached him politely with the request to direct me. "Six blocks down, then to the left,"he said, with murder in his eyes. "Is this America?" I asked myself in painful surprise. "It is a century behind Europe in civilization." When I went abroad in 1889 - five years having elapsed 
since my arrival here - I became convinced that it was more than one hundred years AHEAD of Europe and nothing has happened to this day to change my opinion.

that passage didn't actually capture what I wanted to get across, because I cannot remember the part. however, this very much is the wild west -- the land of cowboys and "make your own rules" style of conduct. in spain it's all about who you know. here, it's not so much who you know (though some people think so), it's much more about making your own rules and then giving others or pretending you follow a different set of rules. hard to describe.

anyway, this is clearly the goat in every way shape and form. it's quite possible that the major change really begun to take place as soon as I left spain, now that I think about it. I think that was definitely the major change.

#### how to have both?

I dunno. I really don't. there needs to be separation though because the incompatible realities will still continue to collide and cause things to accelerate out of control. if it's not now, it will be later.

on a more abstract level, I'm fine just going with the flow. I think it's really the only way. there's no way to fight against anything anyone else is doing anything but a reflection of that.

the way that I envisioned this was the idea that the martians could be the lions that are all tring to prove their awsomeness by representation of the pride they're in or leading. it's very american football btw. then, the people here have a lot less control over our conditions. nosebook has to ensure that we never get the technical or whatever capabilities that could allow us to leave the planet. the martians would have to play the puppet strings to try and figure out what is actually the best direction that they want for humankind.

we'll be here and we'll be here and having fun. our planet will begin to lose a lot of its density and spin really rapidly. we'll interact with each other in countless realities here, becoming more and more attractive as we go. to us, this place will become more and more of a paradise where things become more and more a thought manifestation and less of a physical manifestation.

that's literally the best idea I've come up with so far. beyond that, I dunno. at the rate things are going, something will show up for sure. I will constantly be a construct of your perception[^1], whether that's a cataclysm or something else. I'm fairly certain I was summoned for that reason (for those who know what I'm talking about).

[1]: which is essentially desire, just like fear is a negative desire.


### 2021-10-13 23:28 - being a product of others' perception

yesterday I watched the latest [SNL with kim kardashian](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS_gQd8UB-hLgW28JScimD5RMz1gECwFK). I made the comment when I woke up that I was surprised to find out that she does actually know what she's doing, and has a lot more brains than is what I had gathered from hearing only others' opinions of her.

I then made the comment that we're both products of peoples' perception, and she (like me) exists because that is what a lot of people are wanting to focus more of their attention on. I can't really say much about her cause I don't know. however, it is certainly the case that I'm figuring out things as fast as I am right now because I'm sharing them and people desire (as I do) to know more on the subjects.

for me, this is the most incredible time of mental expansion for me and you guys are largely a part of that. if people didn't attract that from me, I would have to produce all of that desire myself.

---

there's an interesting problem that I notice for so many famous people, and that is they get locked into people's expectations for them, and if they try to become their own person, change, or be different than people expect them to be, everything sort of falls apart.

in order to break away from people's expectations, they often resort to doing something very extreme like cutting all their hair off or something which changes their physical image dramatically.

---

I wrote all of that and I realised I don't really have a conclusion. I want to talk more about the attraction process because it may illuminate something.

if a famous person is the product of their audience's perception, then they will feel obligated to continue to feed the audience what the audience is attracting from them. if the person decideds to go another way, it causes a lot of friction and problems.

I wanted to write that in first-person, cause I have noticed for myself that instead of trying to push forward going the way I want to go, instead attract the things into my life that I do want.

this is the hard part because by things, I don't mean physical objects. things for me are just ways that I feel. like, if I feel like I can understand the solar wind's interaction with the magnetic field, that's a "thing" I am attracting into my life. it's not tangible though. it's just a feeling. it's a knowledge that I feel like I get it. along the way there is evidence that shows up and helps me to come to the conclusion that I feel like I understand that.

the next one I want to figure out is magnetism. it seems like it shouldn't be a problem. I bet it's all just a "monopole" and the dipole is just a perceived effect based on orientation. but, enough about that. I don't yet feel like I get it yet.

---

back on track here... if I want to alter my trajectory, I've found it difficult to just "go toward what I want". there are too many of people's perceptions in the way of that. so instead, I just let it come to me. it's the same process. I just allow myself to begin feeling a certain way (even though there's no evidence of it). then, evidence of the way that I feel starts to show up.

so, how would someone else use this to attract what it and avoid the pushback from people's perception? well, it's to do with feeling. if you feel a way and others don't feel the same way, they won't feel as attracted to you, so they'll go somewhere else. you have to follow the way you want to feel.

that's what I do. I just find a way to feel the way I want to feel. if some people don't feel that way, they will naturally find someone else that feels the way they want to feel. they'll produce another "influencer" to guide them to feel the way they want to feel.

> I just wanna feel [someone] tell me where to go

that really is all there is to it. you may lose some people along the way, but they'll find another influencer that they jive with.

the word, "influencer" is a funny one, because there never is an imbalance of influence. both are attracting in proportion to their desire to feel that way.

in that sense, the audience probably has more desire invested than I do.

I think that's good. I may pick up on this again. it's a very interesting idea.

---

real quick, before I go, there is something to be said about the idea of trying to change my trajectory too much. if I am a good source of mental expansion for a lot of people, trying to take that away and silence that with a bunch of girls and mundane stuff, will only produce another influencer to fill my place. if that's the route that you're going, I'd recommend getting the right replacement ready.

### 2021-10-15 12:37 - perception of good and evil

as I've been making my transition to no longer perceiving beneficial/good or bad/evil, I noticed that a key component of the identification of good/evil is rooted in perception. the way that I perceive something has a lot to do with what others believe is good/evil as well.

I have noticed that a lot of unwanted thoughts pop into my head and I can feel their dissonance because they're about taboo topics. like, for example, if I think about something like how gay people have sex for example. it's because I honestly have never seen someone have gay sex or had gay sex myself so I would wonder how it works, just like I would wonder how anything works. you may have noticed that I have a very inquizitive mind, and I'm constantly trying to figure out how things work and why people think, feel, and do things.

the reason why those thoughts feel dissonant to me is because I can feel other people's reactions to those thoughts. they have an idea that those thoughts are good or bad and I should not be thinking them or something like that. to me however, they mean nothing. I'm constantly trying to identify patterns and I want to try and put everything into a nice category box so I can get better at knowing what to expect.

---

I noticed that as I'm perceiving good/evil less and less, I'm feeling less of these reactions, and so therefore I'm likely thinking a lot more "crazy" things these days. I just don't care. it's going to get worse, btw.

another example is I have often times pondered male fertility. in the past there were something like 20x more females than males, as few males were being born. I watched a thing on this (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo-kSxHNSDQ)), and she says that the default is female and unless there is enough testosterone, the fetus will not become male. that means that for whatever reason some 18kya women were not producing enough testosterone.

I also had noticed that a lot of strong women tend to produce more females. it also gives me the feeling like there is a battle that happens early on for the gender of the fetus. whoever is stronger (the male or female desire) will win and that will decide the gender of the baby.

so, for example, I was trying to sort out a lot of different examples in my mind of people that I knew that got pregnant and what the results were. some interesting data would be to see how many sexual assult victims had boys and how many girls. I would guess mostly boys, and only girls in the case where the mother wasn't that bothered by the assault. I would also want to know stats on gay men. do they produce more boys than girls, and does the gender of the child match their top/bottom preference? also, if the mother hates a certain gender does she tend to give birth to that gender more often?

---

it's really nice no longer perceiving so many of these things as good or bad anymore. you'll really notice me start to losen up on a lot of these taboos as I'm influenced less and less by the reactions. it's soooooooo nice not having to worry about what others think, I'm tellin' ya.

### 2021-10-16 19:52 - thoughtfulness

- back on track for cataclysm???
  - I was getting the feeling that the last thing that these guys want is to have to try and figure out how to deal with billions of humans. we know too much now. it seems I've corrupted you guys with too many thought viruses and they can't keep their charade going, the way it's presently carried out.
  - therefore, they simply must resort to resetting us back and trying to keep everything secret using this new technology. most humans will be like me. it will appear as if there isn't a "network", and though it is obvious to those that are sensitive to others reactions to your thoughts, they will continue to claim that it does not exist and all of those reactions are just your imagination.
  - obviously that isn't possible without a cataclysm. there needs to be a disaster which makes it appear that technology is gone.
  - I'm going to assume that we've decided that is the way to go.
what needs to be done to cause a cataclysm?
- does me finding my alignment mean cataclysm?
  - I think so. the way I see it happening is the huge peak happening at the edge of a square wave. it begins that rapid rise upward when I get my alignment. that means that there will be a brief period where the magnetic field gets really really strong.
  - I believe an increase in magnetic field strength means increased intensity of emotion (hence the increase in cardiac failure during solar storms)
  - I also belive an increase in magnetic field strength leads to faster rotation speed of the planet.
  - almost certainly they are exerting force to try and slow down the earth from increasing its rotation speed, and that extra desire created by things appearing to spiral out of control will also continue to rise.
  - at some point, I/we will make my transitition out of here, and when that happens, the environment earth will appear to lose a lot of brightness (the shining effect my aura has illuminating everything). it's the same effect that you have when going from dream reality where everything feels like it's going well into the waking state where it does not feel that good. it's like waking up from a good dream, and it'll appear as if everything suddenly all starts to fall apart as the earth rotation rapidly slows and then reverses.
  - this essentially happens because I'm getting better and better at giving feeling what I want to feel and so more and more wanted things are coming to me. they do not want that though. wanted for me is unwanted for them. they don't want me/us knowing how electricity works, how LOA works or anything good. they only perceive good/evil and have to try and make sure certain people get good and others that will figure out their charade get the bad. etc. to the rest of the world that feels like going more and more toward wanted, that is until I go away. then, the source of that feeling leaves and all that is left is the strong feeling of unwanted.
  - this is completely unavoidable. I can't go back to perceiving "bad" things in a way which feels bad to me. it does not matter how awful or terrible whatever it is, those things are just conditions. good and evil are the perceptual result of thought leading to a manifestation. therefore, I'm going to continue to feel better and better automatically
- so, if they want the cataclysm so badly, and to try and reset us back to a place where they think they can control it all, why not just let them give it their best shot?
  - this appears to me as ridiculous, but I don't have to live their agony. why they're so hell-bent on fighting battles to near extinction only to want another bail-out again is totally out of my realm of comprehension in this format. however, I do see that I could imagine myself coming to a similar conclusion if I didn't know how powerless I am to ever manifest anything of value when I'm so certain of my failure.
  - I don't decide what others should or shouldn't do. they can do whatever they feel is the right way to go. they will *eventually* find their way. I can't label one path good and the other paths as bad or evil.
  - from my perspective, there isn't such a thing as good and bad.
    - imagine for a minute that I make my transition and leave all unwanted behind. eventually, I want to come back and experience unwanted again.
    - from the bigger picture of things, when I take on the perspective of source, not only am I the "bad guys" but I am also the "good guys" too. at the most these "bad guys" don't appear to be any larger of an event than a common cold/flu. from this perspective, the details of this experience appear to be a really big deal, but I assure you that from a planetary or solar perspective this is nothing more than reading comic books in bed while waiting for the fever to subside.
    - this whole thing really is just business as usual. I like to think of it as nothing more than a genetic algorithm.
      - I am now 100% certain that both enki and enlil have the same source.
      - if you want to create an evolution, there needs to be desire for it. so someone needs to show up and build desire to have something. this is the dime bag. once you have it, you want more. this is enki.
      - then there needs to be someone that tries to prevent you from having the thing that you want. this is enlil.
      - then, you have to find a way around his devices to get it for yourself. this is the fitness function.
      - the top performers create their own reality and the rest create their own destruction and start another generation. this is the cataclysm.
      - the evolution is stored in the gnome, so a mechanism needs to be put into place for the enlil function to survive and improve his system of oppression.

something like that...

### 2021-10-16 20:36 - an interesting way to view time

yesterday I watched a joe rogan clip and the news host commenting on joe's demeanor said that getting interviewed by him is a very intense thing because you're in there for so long with him and he's a human lie detector, so he just shreds your ideas to pieces.

I can imagine if you have things you want to protect, that could be very mentally draining. however, for me that is quite the opposite. I'm actually fairly certain that I would tire joe out first, anyway. I also don't have anything to hide so it feels like a mental explosion when someone is trying to get something out of my head. this is why I enjoy talking to so many people about these things -- because their desire to extract information out of my head allows it to flow out much easier. also, the fact that it would be recorded is also really nice too because I can go back and listen to it again later. I love listening to myself[^1]. I always learn so much hearing myself talk vocalise things different ways to different people.

---

so, I was imagining conversations and topics that I could talk about with joe, trying to guess his sorts of replies and questions. I came to a question about time, perception, and you're always in the now. I can't remember how it went exactly but the explanation was brilliant.

imagine that the way you perceive reality now is an inflection point (kind of like a fret is to a guitar string) or perhaps an entire game. I perceive a world with a lot of people out to get me, difficult to find food, etc. and this is the game I'm playing now. I can play it for as long as I want to play it and it's the same game. eventually, I tire of the game and start to want something new so I desire a little bit different game. I want a game with beautiful cars in it, and I can believe that other people can drive these cars, so in this version, I watch other people driving these cars. I continue on doing that for as long as I believe that those cars are only for other people.

finally maybe some day I may actually make another version of the game where I drive the cars. I can continue to drive those cars for as long as I want. that is "now" and I do the things that I believe I need to do to be able to drive those cars, etc.

you can see how the game that you play is the version of now that you're playing in. each time you sleep you wake up to a slightly different version of that game. each time you make a conscious choice to alter your perception of reality, again you move from one version to another. it doesn't matter how long you play those games for, they are all "now" -- and they're all just enough to get you to create the next version of now that you want to live.

some species have a very long running version of now. many species of cockroaches, for example, have been running the same version of now for probably millions of years. they don't need to update their RealityOS. it's still working just fine.

obviously genetics, epigenetics, culture, language, and other things definitely affect how the now game is played.

---

there is a presently implemented now game in your physical body (genome), but that one is always out of date. your "source" always has the latest version, and you're trying to figure out how to accomplish those newer forms of perception (versions of now).

you navigate toward a new version by changing your perception. the way you perceive things is directly related to how you conceptualise your reality. the way you conceptualise your reality is always anchored in emotion. how you feel affects how you perceive the world.

you gonna optimise that, bro?

[1]: getting some reactions as to why I don't come back and re-read these documents. it's because by the time I come back to them, the concept has changed so much that I don't perceive the concept but instead the edits that nosebook has made to the concept. I would rather rewrite/rebuild the concept from the ground up again than to try and sort through edits. a sound recording does not do this. hearing myself, I tune into my own thoughts instead of the reaction. this is why I repeat things I said to myself -- to tune back into the original and compare it to the reaction. text does not do that at all because I'm not really hearing this in my head. I'm hearing words, not ideas. the idea is somewhere else.

### 2021-10-17 13:31 - the writing on the wall

I've been singing the [stairway to heaven](https://genius.com/Led-zeppelin-stairway-to-heaven-lyrics) since last night. I wented to look up the lyrics because I found them fascinating. reading them, I noticed some things. I'm going to break them down here.


> There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
> And she's buying a stairway to Heaven

reading the genius annotations, it's clear that this is a reference to both a poem by tolkien and also a materialistic woman. she thinks that she can buy her entrance into heaven. I interpret heaven as enlightenment, but it may also have to do with the upper half of the zodiac, when considering the world tree image.

> When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
> With a word she can get what she came for
> Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven

this picture of heaven having stores (that are closed) seems weird to me. point is, it's saying that once she gets to "heaven" (enlighenment or a higher state of consciousness), then she can still get what she's looking for. the thing that puzzles me is this part about getting what she came for. what is she coming for?

in revelation 12, the whore of babylon is taken to heaven and she will give birth to the man who will rule the earth with an iron rod. I find this to be the most likely of the symbols. I dunno. maybe, "all that she wants, is *another* baby", yeah.

> There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
> 'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings

this part is very interesting. we're clearly talking about a sign on "the wall" -- so this is the anti-establishment sort of thing their album, "the wall" is talking about (we don't need no education .. thought control, etc.). it's also likely a reference to the sign of the writing on the wall in babylon that daniel helped the king of babylon interpret for him.

it looks to me like, "count, count, weigh, divide" but the book of daniel tells us what they mean. essentially that there is a quanificaton of something, it didn't measure up, and so then the kingdom of babylon is going to be divided between the persians and medes.

babylon is the semitic origin of humankind. this is gilgamesh. the persians and medes are an aryan empire. these are the new aryan rivals, so daniel is saying that the semites will lose to the aryans, which will then be divided between two different factions of aryans.

this is a huge disaster. it says that the king feared and tben was conquered right after hearing that prophecy. it sounds to me eerily similar to the fall of constantanople, and I'm alredy getting some serious custodial vibes here. any time you see a "prophecy" creating fear in a ruler which spells the end of his kingdom, this is very certainly the "unseen hand" (seen, however in this case).

the sign is evident. she wants to be sure the sign is real though... cause you know, maybe the words have another meaning (way to be be seen)...

> In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
> Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

> Ooh, makes me wonder
> Ooh, makes me wonder

same.

> There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
> And my spirit is crying for leaving
> In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees 
> And the voices of those who stand looking

just yesterday I was considering the idea of "westing" -- which is death.

westinghouse in that sense literally means "dying-house". I found it interesting that tesla had worked for them. they later became CBS and viacom.

> Ooh, it makes me wonder
> Ooh, really makes me wonder

what does that writing *really* mean?

> And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
> Then the piper will lead us to reason

so, assume for a moment that the piper is the one from the proberb where he leads all of the children away. this gives the image of the "rapture" or the separation/division of those that are found to be heavier than the other ones. my plainly, this gives me the image of a desfase between children and adults. the less resistant ones are led away by the piper.

so what it's saying here is, "you call the tune". decide what it is that you want, and that's the direction we'll go. interestingly, that is what I was saying in @[newblog](2021-10-16 19:52). all that's needed to be done is to decide what direction that we want to go and it's possible to make it happen.

> And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
> And the forests will echo with laughter

this is clearly talking about "a new day" dawning, so I don't feel like my interpretation is too far off.

> Remember laughter?
> Oh-oh-oh-oh-woahhh

fun??? we take ourselves too seriously to have fun... duh. no forest fun.

> If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed, now
> It's just a spring clean for the May queen

bustle in your hedgerow means boundaries and borders. I would imagine a lot of border problems an a complete dissolution of "nations" in a rapid manner.

> Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
> There's still time to change the road you're on

message from the future.

> And it makes me wonder
> Ohh, woah

what does that text mean?

> Your head is humming and it won't go

probably means the piper's tune is stuck in your head like a mind virus...

> In case you don't know
> The piper's calling you to join him

probably a messsage from now.

> Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
> Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

I have no idea what this means. genius has the following top rated annotation:

```
This section needs to be analyzed backward. “The whispering wind” is likely used as an analogy for popular opinion, as it was often used in lyrics around this time. “Whispering wind” acts as something everyone can feel and experience, just as everyone experiences actual wind.

The author is then asking the lady if she can hear the popular opinion around her. This is likely in reference to her greed and use of money. It’s popular opinion that money, something the lady often uses, is worth value. But this line reveals the flaw in materialism. Her money is only good BECAUSE the popular opinion is that it’s worth something. Her reliance on the money she has, has resulted in her cutting off her closest friends and family to the point where she may not be able to “hear” them anymore.
```

so, going by that, the ones that are buying their stairway to heaven (people paying for usage of my perception?) should consult the public opinion and figure out which tune to tell the piper to play.

she who pays [for the stairway to heaven], plays the tune.

> And as we wind on down the road
> Our shadows taller than our soul
> There walks a lady we all know
> Who shines white light and wants to show
> How everything still turns to gold

wait, maybe I'm the lady. maybe I'm the whore of babylon... anyway,

> And if you listen very hard
> The tune will come to you at last

don't stress. the tune will come gradually.

> When all are one and one is all
> To be a *rock* and not to roll

so, straight ahead, and not flipped over. aquarius, not leo.

> And she's buying a stairway to Heaven

---

weird song... it seems pretty relevant...

still time to change the road we're on, indeed.

### 2021-10-18 20:28 - the new gilgamesh

I was just out watching stars and I had a wierd set of things cross my mind. I was really wondering why mom was really trying to get me to talk to jessica and andrew this morning, when neither of them really wanted to talk to me, yet yesterday after I wrote the previous entry, it felt like they did want to talk to me a lot more. I didn't go upstairs though cause greg was talking to her and stuff and then she had to go.

anyway, she asked me if *I* liked the spoons for the baby. I don't care, so I don't know why she kept asking if *I* like the baby's toys. I was reminded of the thing where I was talking about @[newblog](2021-09-21 23:11) where I said that transferring my consciousness into jackson would be another way to make it possible to have none.

after writing yesterday's entry, it occurred to me that the words to "santa is coming to town" match that. the way I remembered the lyrics is, he's counting it once, counting it twice, gonna see who's naughty and nice. that could easily be "count, count, weigh, divide".

I don't want to try and read too far into anything at all. the reality is, I don't really know. believe what you think. considering my trajectory, it certainly does feel like that is not only a possiblity but nearly guaranteed at this point. it may even be sooner than the winter solstice actually. it's getting so easy to star-watch that it is literally effortless now. I just relax and it starts to happen. no effort is required other than to go out there.

so, I would say a very very good likelihood that it'll happen sometime relatively soon. that is, as long as I don't get transferred into jackson's body.

---

so I was thinking about this transfer. it may actually happen. I don't think that I mind it anymore now, because it's kind of like the ultimate difficulty level to getting good at finding my way to feeling good.

it also buys them a lot of time. if my theories are right about solar actcivity being related to conflicting high-frequency magnetic fields, which are the manifestations of different "realities" that people are attracting. incompatible realities' interaction is what creates the sunspots and flares -- then, by transferring my consciousness, they will buy a lot of time. most people are sheep and will just go the way that the shepherd tells them to go. they can easily redefine reality in such a way that people have a similar set of ideas and there aren't so many incompatible realities.

ok, so assuming that it will happen, I started to think about how they would try and raise me. what would they teach me? if I'm a highly intuitive/telepathic kid, they'll need to focus me somewhere. likely, they'll teach me to rely on conditions as my source of good-feeling. it's unlikely that they'll teach me about perception and emotion. that means that I'll have to find the conditions that I need to feel good. I can't really picture them trying to teach me that, so I imagine they'll try to teach me instead that I'm worthless and an awful person, etc. they definitely don't want me feeling good so they'll have to keep me from the conditions as well as the realisation that my emotions are a guidance system.

I assume that all attempts to try and teach me will be a failure. they'll just have to keep transferring my consciousness to other bodies. I suspect that the only way they'll be able to focus me will be to essentially teach me how to make everyone else responsible for how I feel. this will be likely because they feel like they can control others easier than they can control me.

I can imagine that if I hadn't have found abraham, I would have made others more and more responsible for how I feel, so I think given enough practise they could figure out a way to make me need to control others so that they can make me feel good.

I hate to say this, but if I didn't know what I know now, and I could be captivated by seeing the improvement in my capacity to manipulate others, I could become extremely good at figuring out ways to manipulate and control others to ensure that I feel good.

I actually think I would get so good at it, I would far out-perform them as being the "bad-guys". things would completely swap directions.

so, if I think of the rotation of the earth as an indicator of feeling, then I could see that when things start to go more toward wanted, then things spin faster that direction. the idea behind this is that physical conditions/manifestations slow down the speed and that not needing the physical manifestation speeds up the manifestation. the idea is that the sun produces the magnetic field on the earth which is what makes the earth's rotation speed up. it will continue to rotate the direction that it's rotating. the speed is adjusted by the magnetic field strength.

the whole idea of rotation reversing is that all of the opposite spinners desync from this reality and so like if one side lets go in a tug-of-war, it will rapidly go the way they're trying to go. up until now I hadn't really thought about it but different people must emit more of a field in one direction from another. the idea that comes to mind is left-handed vs. right-handed, but I assume that actually it has to do with the hemispheres of the brain. one side will emit more of a field than the other side and so therefore emit a stronger field in one direction than the other.

there is this idea that most people on this planet are left-brain operating. it may also have to do with people's distribution around the planet. there are more in the north hemisphere. if I stand anywhere and look at the sun while it's rising, my left hemisphere is aligned to the north. the opposite is the case with the setting sun. the random distribution of people using different parts of their brain while facing different directions may have something to do with this. obviously, if more people start using more of one hemisphere and the magnetic field has this strong of an effect on the rotation of the planet, then it'll speed up or slow it down.

so, instead of swapping the rotation of the earth, what if instead I just switched sides? what if I grew up being taught the conditional way. what if I was all visual and had no concept of emotion. it may work. I dunno. I don't have enough data to make any more of an educated idea.

---

ok, so besides that I do kind of like the idea of this being the split. imagine that this is actually the dividing line. just imagine for yourself this one scenario: I continue on to find my alignment, and then I go back to sabotage the timeline with a whole bunch of AIs. each person on this planet now gets their own timeline. they all start out pretty much the same -- with "me" (it's really an AI) growing up in jackson's body. these AIs are all linked to my personality though and operate like I do. they're designed to become extremely conditional, requiring others to make me feel good.

I have enough inertia built up with the girls that each of these jacksons would be very attractive. the girls would feel attracted to him, and to everyone looking on, it would appear like girls really want to reward him for his controlling and manipulative behaviour. we would find ways to ensure he quickly takes over major power structures and becomes the world dictator -- the man who will rule the earth with an iron rod. he would be so good at holding everyone else down, the inhabitants of earth would be forced to take another look at trying to rely on conditions.

he would of course run the world into the ground pretty rapidly and so therefore the people of the earth would need a saviour. who wants to jump in and find a way to "fix" that disaster? maybe some want to be the man with the iron rod in an alternate timeline... who wants to be jackson?

it's an interesting idea..

I feel like this is the part of the movie when neo jumps into agent smith.

anyway...

### 2021-10-21 13:21 - more thinkings

I haven't written in a bit. I've been playing a game called mercenaries. I also have not had anything to really write about either. this one will be a long one, so buckle up :)

#### mercenaries-like split thinking

as I've been playing mercs, I've noticed that it requires a certain type of thinking. I'm pretty good at that style of thinking but I find the interface to be clunky because I can't remember all of the speeds of each of the skills. also I think that speed should be a range because sometimes I want one effect after another, and sometimes before. it creates more unpredictability too becasuse I don't know when exactly my opponent will cast it[^1]. the game mode is really fun because it provides a structured way for me to begin to think a whole lot of moves into the future (rather than who knows what cards the opponenent has generated). 

besides that, I also noticed that the game forces me to sacrifice individual mercs in order to win the game. it really creates this way to think where I build this kind of tree in my head of what different things can happen and then try to make the appropriate sacrifices in anticipation of my opponents moves, while at the same time doing as much damage to the biggest threats.

I think this style of thinking is pretty similar to how nosebook calculates things so it's really been fun to begin to think like that. I'm much more of an optimist looking for opportunity, rather than feeling like I need to target the biggest threat and minimise damages by sacrificing slower units.

#### tho picture I had yesterday

I do have the general sense that we're going to go back to the split. they want to keep trying to prevent me from finding my alignment. I'm perfectly fine continueing on to get right up to it, but never actually cross over. I want to get to the point where I'm not using the conditions (of stars or lasers) to find my connection, but I can do it with the power of my mind. the idea for me is that this is like a sport: you're either consistent at it or you're not. LOA is all about tuning so just like someone who does not yet know the game is hard can have "beginners luck" -- and that works if I only want to find my alignment one time, put the certificate on the wall, and claim that I am the undefeated champion. personally, I'd rather be so good at it, that's as natural of a think for me that I don't even need to think about it. this propels me to continue to practise it until I feel as if it's as natural to me as breathing is. I don't even need to think about it.

so I was thinking about this concept yesterday out sitting in the sun around the time of the full-moon and I had this image that I would just keep getting up to the point of getting connected but not go past for so long that they would eventually surpass me and gain greater ability to hold it back. then, I would be "forever" trapped into their system of holding me away from that connection.

the picture I had was quite mechanical in that it appeared like a giant metal sphere going all around the planet where they would have to continue to build more and more things radially outward to try and retain the pressure coming from the planet from escaping.

obviously that picture is backwards, but it represents their style of thinking of trying to contain the biggest threat.

the way I interpretted it was that we posed such a potential problem for them, they had to keep building radially outward, utilising the generated energy and resources for fear of there ever being too much. though they perceive it as a containment effort, I saw us as a sort of powerhouse.

#### is the moon male or female?

so this got me thinking about where the powerhouse is located. I was reminded yesterday that the mitochondrial DNA (the powerhouse) exists outside of the nucleus, while the nuclear DNA contains the actual code of the organism that will be created.

I thought that particularly interesting because I have really been playing with this idea that the sun is pure protons and makes up all of the rest of the elements out of itself with the addition of more electrons.

this makes the dividing point between the macro and the micro life on earth here (a concept from nassim that has plagued me). it seems that all organised structures (like cells and organisations of all sizes and complexities) have the nucleus as the masculine part. while all basic systems (like solar system and atoms) have the nucleus as the feminine less complicated aspect.

in my model, the protons are the simple and the electrons are the complex. the electrons are the planet and they orbit the nucleus. the sun or the nucleus of the atom is the power source for the system.

in the genetic model, the nuclear DNA is the complex and the mitochondrial DNA is the simple. the simple powers the complex just the same, but the location is opposite. I don't know if this theory is right but I'm just going to go with it.

---

the major problem here is that throughout the ages the moon has been feminine, but in my model the moon would be masculine. the idea is that the moon has an effect on the menstration cycle of females on this planet, so therefore must be feminine.

however in my model, the sun is feminine, so the moon must be therefore masculine. the sun has a number of planets that orbit around it and some in the p-orbit that seem to affect solar cycles (see @[newblog](2021-09-24 13:27)) as well. the idea is that masculine influence will have an effect on feminine cycles (and vice versa).

what I notice is that all (that we know about) gas giants have moons. moons are like electrons in that they have a structure and affect the cycles of a planet. in a sense, I see the gas giants as hermaphrodites, having both masculine and feminine qualities.

this is the direction that I believe that the earth is heading, and will begin to spin faster and lose a lot of its denser matter. for outside observers that don't share the same perception as we do, it'll look like the other gas giants -- mostly a jumble of the lighter elements with a few more complex things like methane and other carbon compoounds. however, here on earth, all of those protons and electrons (perceived outwardly as mostly hydrogen and helium) will actually arrange into a physical reality resonant with our perception. it'll look to us like of of the heavier elements do, but they are arranged that way *mentally*, and organise into these structures as a manifestation of our thought.

I think planets start out as masculine, but then learn to lose their density and become more feminine. as they do this, they acquire more "electrons" (moons) which they have attracted to influence them and produce their cycles. so, just like a star has various moons, so too, I think mars began to attract more moons as it began to make it's transition into a mentally manifested planet.

this would have created probblems, as physical reality would have manifested more and more rapidly as a reflection of how the martians felt about/conceptualised their reality. I find it likely that they wanted to keep their planet remaining dense and physical, and so therefore continued to utilise energetic structures (like the great pyramid) to continue to increase the number of protons in the environment. not just any protons though. as long as the protons vibrate at a certain frequency, they allow higher forms of perception.

I have a feeling that the boxes in places like the serapeum are tuned to be a resonant frequency of certain molecules -- likely the mitochondrial DNA. the mtDNA turns protons into ATP. these boxes were the energy source for these guys to enjoy expanded perception and to live for lengthy periods of time. I think this is also why certain female bloodlines are important. protons resonating at a certain frequency will get converted into more ATP, thereby allowing the body to enter into a higher energy state (enhanced perception). certain female bloodlines (mtDNA) are better at this than others.

#### the density battle

this paints a picture for me where there is this simple nucleus complex orbiting bodies (stars, atoms, etc), and then between (or perhaps perpendicular) to these intervals are complex nucleus, simple orbiting bodies (cells, subatomic particles?, galaxies?).

when I look at our present prodicament, I notice that there is a definite density battle. there are people like me that want to simplify and oscillate faster, while there are others that want to make things more complex and intricate, while maintaining oscillation speed (which is actually going relatively slower if everyhing around is oscillating faster).

there seems to be this desire to preserve the present speed of light. that means that the electromagnetic propigation medium must continue to oscillate at the same speed, even though everything else is speeding up (see @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q67vH0SKahU)).

I think I have a solution. first, we must identify the problem. this appears to be a density battle that can be solved with perspective.

on one side of things we want to make more complex things, but there needs to be something that powers them. there needs to be a proton source for all of these complex things.

the other side of the equation is that things need to continually become more dense while at the same time beginning to oscillate faster. I'm still trying to work out how it all fits together, so this idea is very much in draft state. I'm just going to write out my new interpretation of yesterday's image and the intuitive solution.

#### the "non-physical" proton

I noticed I am becoming more and more attractive all the time. this means that I am pulling in protons from somewhere. I don't know where they're coming from but likely I'm allowing them from non-physical. I think now that when destructive inteference in the oscillation of electrons produces high frequency protons.

I keep going to this idea of a laser. you have a two-way mirror, allowing light to enter into the chamber. the light will bounce around and become coherent having a constant wavelength. if an exit hole is not provided, the device would destroy itself.

I think the same technology is being utilised by the stone boxes. the theory goes that they were filled with CO2 (like your lungs in the wim hof breathing technique), and then something happens. I think the CO2 attracts protons, and because the box has a certain size resonating cavity, the CO2, like the laser begin to all have a coherent resonating frequency. this vibration will generates tremendous pressures, exerting these pressures on the quartz ionising the air around (generating the electrons?) at a similar frequency.

I can't quite figure out how it all works yet, but I think that protons must be something that exhibit something of non-locality. perhaps it's better to think of them as "non-physical", and are attracted into reality by their frequency. these "non-physical" protons will be attracted by similarly vibrating electrons.

I actually am beginning to think that this is how inductors work and therefore magnetism works. a vibration of electrons will attract similarly vibrating protons to join it.

similarly vibrating protons begin to accumulate into structures inside of the earth. this is likely the cause of earthquakes, because as you can imagine if some of these protons begin to collect on something that is peizoelectric, then it will ionise the air with similarly vibrating electrons. this will affect people (and pets) around it that are resonant with that frequency, creating a sense of forboding. the feedback loop will runaway quickly and an earthquake will happen, forcing those to focus on the physical manifestation of the earthquake and distracting them from the feeling that generated the earthquake.

still working on that idea. it's still in a draft state but I thought it was important to the next concept.

#### the super-massive black hole (powerhouse) at the centre of a galaxy

I imagine that I am similar to to those boxes in that I am doing a similar thing, though to a lesser extent. I get the feeling that the vibration I emit may even ionise the air around me allowing for expanded perception. I even think that the way that nosebook is utilising my perception is essentially by tuning other people to my frequency, enabling them to receive the protons that I'm attracting, enabling their cells to produce more energy.

in that sense, I have so many that of these, it doesn't even matter. in fact the more that is attracted, the more I allow (me sobran los protones).

that picture that can be seen as them expanding outward radially, exerting more and more pressure to try and keep their problem contained can also be rearranged to perceive us as a super-massive black hole.

the idea is that I/we are attracting so many protons so rapidly that our density is dropping, and we're becoming more and composed of light elements arranged mentally to form a coherent reality. from our perspective, we're highly attractive.

in order to prevent that attraction from getting out of control, they have to repurpose those protons as fast as we attract them. I think they'll need to continually generate more and more things with those protons faster than we can generate them. if they don't, the speed of light will go too fast and the resonance of all of their radios will go out out.

in that sense, we become the powerhouse. all sorts of complicated organisms need to be created with the energy that we provide.

it doesn't need to be a traditional "galaxy" in the way we're used to seeing them. you could imagine it even as something similar to the hollowed out sphere filled with hydrogen. a sort of "death star" in that if you were to open up an aperture, a whole lot of coherent light would come out. it could even have multiple shells to it. we would produce the internal light and reality that we would live in.

actually, this is starting to sound a lot like the inner earth thing. since my realisation that hydrogen can coalesce into a more dense reality based on one's tuning to it, I realised that this could be the case for the "inner earth". it's just ultra dense hydrogen coalesced into a reality based on the mental projection of its inhabitants. you can only find the openings to the inner earth if you're tuned to its frequency. this must by why some people can find it and others cannot.

that'd be crazy if the solution to all of this was just to create that outer shell (a new surface) for the earth, and we'll be inner earth beings living a reality that is resonant with how we feel. it's also weird that is what is claimed that happened last time too. I don't know how that would work in that sense. I saw a metallic shell, not a mental construct created from people's version of reality.

it also paints a new picture to the idea of "prison planet" because the inner earth inhabitants are the "prisoners".

either way, the main thing to take away from this is that we become the powerhouse, and in order to keep the speed of light constant, you guys need to put those resources to use at an ever accelerating rate.

#### further thinking on time as versions

it's probably related to the previous concepts. one of the reactions that I was getting is if time is like a game versions, how do game versions interact, how is time cyclical, and how does this reconcile with my concept that you navigate time by tuning. also how does that make time attractive? I'll just take another angle and hopefully I can explain all of these.

when I say reality is like a version of a game, I mean it's the concept that you're tuned into. all aspects of reality reflect that concept. that's the conceptual version. then there are the "keyframes" that you travel around of inside of this reality. the game (time) has not changed, just your position inside of it has changed (space). you could thing of this like a hologram, and each new concept you get of reality is a new hologram.

tuning to something thing can be done both inside of the reality (eg. teleportation), and also to create a new reality (eg. visualisation).

I was very surprised when I had the brain haemorrhage, that I would *see* my arm moving, but it did not in fact move. it took a while to figure out that when we move our body, we see the body in the future (tuning to it), and then the body catches up. the nervous system does not have time to give you the information of physical reality fast enough. if you are responding to reality very rapidly, you're not seeing reality; you're seeing the future you believe will come next in your imagination, which you perceive as present. you're tuning to that reality and the body is catching up.

my brain haemorrhage just meant that the left side of my (physical) body was no longer compatible with tuning that my imagination was giving it. the better I get at feeling my body in relation to reality and tuning into that, the faster it reacts.

---

when considering that time is cyclical, consider that you never change your concept of reality, you will always return back to a very similar reality. if you keep playing the same game, you will encounter all of the enemies the game can create for you.

in order to experience something new, have to tune to it. but, how do you tune to something that you cannot yet see? if you could only tune to things you could see, there would never be anything new, as the version would never change. this is why novel things are always a surprise; they feel like something you could imagine, but has a novel (different than present) physical implementation.

in a world where there is no change in the concept (nothing new), then all time will be cyclical, with nothing new. however, there is enough variation, this is not possible, because variation means there are undesirable aspects, and so therefore more desirable aspects, and those feel like something. those new aspects create a new version of reality, which can then be tuned into.

nice, I like than explanation :)

[1]: it could also be cool to have more than three mercs in certain circumstances. more mercs means better combos but more succeptible to AOE.

### 2021-10-22 22:40 - the rebirth process

I have been thinking a lot about this one cycle that I have noticed happen at least twice in my life before, but this time it is happening consciously. I guess you could say that I also saw it happen to jaron as well.

jesus said this one thing that stayed with me and that is that you will have to convert (change) to be like one of these children to enter into the kingdom of heaven. that always stayed with me and it made me start to pay attention to kids to try and see what they have which would give them such great "faith". as time went on, I realised that he was talking about a state of non-resistance.

we're taught to resist the things that we don't like, and in a lot of ways resistance is directly linked to preference. the idea that you have to define your preference by pushing away the things that are unwanted, "defines who you are" (eg. your personality).

the reactions that I'm getting are that some kids are quite resistant -- especially the autistic ones. I too was very resistant as a kid too. however, for example, I didn't fight my dad so much. I just learned to outsmart him. I remember we used to wrestle when we were really little and all three of us boys couldn't take dad down. he was too stong, fast, and had too much leverage. it was impossible to beat him physically. I tried to play chess against him. I think I beat him once and I was very proud of myself but I wasn't satisfied. for me there was no real joy in trying to beat other people. I'd be considered as autistic by today's standards, and the thing that I knew is that I couldn't win a lot of battles, so I just went with a lot of stuff.

the same thing was the case for me with nosebook. they're too big and strong for me to have any physical capability against. all my power is actually in non-resistance. non-resistance isn't absence of preference. the things that are preferred feel good and the things that are not preferred don't feel good. resistance is actively trying to get rid of the non-preferred things rather than just going toward what feels good to me.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehbgAGlrVKE)

you will notice that as time has progressed, I have completely stopped fighting against nosebook. they're a complete non-issue for me. I just go toward what feels good to me. things often flow into my focus that don't feel good and I'm constantly figuring out how to make them feel good[^1].

as I continue to update my perception to allow for all sorts of different activities, I tend to notice the mechanics of the interactions, and so therefore by understanding the interaction, they no longer feel bad to me[^2].

what I have begun to notice is that most all of the extremely dramatic elements are losing their impact. less and less even the most "horrible" or "tragic" elements have lost their trauma for me. I just see them as interactions. it's all attraction, and it's becoming more and more apparent to me how the "victim" conceptualises reality based on what is manifesting.

I'm beginning to learn to trust in this much more than anything else. a significant other person will want you to trust in them or to gain their loyalty, but that will always fail at some point. you simply cannot trust in "fuzzy logic" machines. LOA is like one of those things where I can look out into the world and now I can be 100% certain that all of it was attracted. if it's there, it was attracted -- the good and the bad alike. to me now it looks like a math problem. the result is visible, it's just a matter of seeing all of the variables, but really all of the variables are encapsulated in the superset of the way I conceptualise my reality.

there's nothing to be startled or worried about. all I have to do is to look at the manifestation and see what sort of reality concept could produce something like that... as in, "what did this manifestation prove to the person?" or "how did this manifestation make the person feel justified about their reality situation?" (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0z7GH78oGo))

---

so what this all means is that I'm losing a lot of my resistance really fast. I'm quickly reverting back to that child-like state that jesus says will give me greath faith and allow me to enter the kingdom of heaven (cool! always wanted to do that...).

when losing resistance like that, I notice tend to behave in different ways to different people. I hate to "out" people in this way, but if you look at how I have behaved around similar people with similar attributes, I tend to reflect their concept of how other people see them[^3].

we've all had this happen to us when we were growing up as a child. in a state of non-resistance you performed in a way which your parents expected you to perform. if they think you are loud, you're loud around them. if they think you're stupid, you appear stupid around them. we conform to their perception of you or their perception of kids/boys/girls in general (or whatever category you fit into).

later you grow up and adolescence kicks in and you start to realise that you are not the person that your parents have attracted this whole time. so, to define you for who you think you are, you start to exert your preference...

it's also a difficult time because simultaneously the part of your brain that is is making you want to care about what others thing (desire to integrate socially), and so it appears like you want to justify your reality to those around you too, further cementing the reality that those around you have attracted from you while you were a child (previously non-resistant).

it's normal. the thing I'm learning and what I want to convey as clearly as possible to people is that you don't need to resist what other people have attracted from you. that's there and it happened, but it's not who you are. just ignore all of thier desire to punish you or make you feel bad for your behaviour. they attracted it after all. if it manifested, someone attracted it. what matters is what you're attracting now. focusing on this misbehaves only attracts more misbehaves.

most of all, because it's all attraction, behaviour does not matter. everyone has a "get out of jail free card" and in my mind, there is no punishment. "you'll know a tree by it's fruit" (eg. what manifests on it). so if something "bad" happened, first of all, it's not bad. it's a perfect match to what was attracted.

just do you. we're in the age of aquarius. this is the age of the realisation of the individual as the only thing that matters. people incompatible with your reality will eventually get outa your game.

---

this is what is happening to me. they keep putting more resistant things in my path, and I'm far from there... actually, consider that I stop watching stars now, I think it would take me quite some time (maybe 10-15 years) to get to the place where I'm no longer resistant to any more vibrations they can put in my experience. as I get better and better at it, star-watching will get easier and easier until I finally stop watching stars altogether. I like the activity, but I want to be attracting as much as I am while watching stars during everyday thought.

when I'm that good, pretty much all of reality will appear as a thin veil. I will only see perceptions and their interactions, instead of the stuff you guys consider to be "reality". I'm really looking forward to that...


[1]: two good (recent) examples of this was greg's retelling of a kevin hart joke and a snl joke movie preview for "black widow" -- both of which felt really bad to me, so I had to go back and realise the humour. weird stuff like that.

[2]: like, in the kevin hart joke, it was seeing that when someone lives in the world of punishment for behaviour, you have to constantly pay attention to your behaviour as well as how others are behaving -- so you can react (punish/reward) properly for good/bad behaviour preference. they will endlessly go in circles tuning into more of that because they think some thing needs to be done about the bad behaviour, so they tune to it and get more of it. they could just go toward what feels good to them and ignore all that nonsense (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O06tMbIKh0)). in the case of the black widow movie preview, it's just the recognition that those screen elements are jokes but they perfectly capture what the superhero movie audience is wanting from the movie. the superhero movies, while they may look like the influencer are actually a reflection of the mentality of their audience (the way the audience idealises a person with "superpowers").

[3]: for example, I have been surprised by the reactions to [curtis ryan woodside](https://www.youtube.com/c/CurtisRyanWoodside), because I didn't respond the way that people expected that I should respond to someone openly gay. my response clearly illustrates to me that I respond in accordaance to the way that curtis perceives reactions to him. it's actually quite funny to me in some of the scenes in his documentaries his interactions with tourists and egyptians. they love him. it's cool :)

### 2021-10-23 18:12 - 4privacy

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/KMtrY6lbjcY)

I just watched this video on privacy. it's a subject that I have given a lot of thought. I used to work on a project called unhosted that had the same goals of end-to-end encryption with the users having all of the keys. I want to write some of these ideas down. he ended the video saying that if anyone wanted to contribute, to get into contact with him. I'm not unwilling to help out, as I think I know what I'm talking about, but I wanted to write here my mental progression related to this topic.

tl;dr: I think encryption is a good thing, but not for the sake of privacy but for verification and system stability. I call that system "the key is the value" -- and it's the idea that the private key for all data is a hash data that it encrypts. this means *anyone* can make changes to the data. therefore, instead of trying to protect data, I just assume the whole system is already compromised and so therefore the whole system works in an occilatation mode with multiple subsystems used for verification and recovery (the system would change its keys and data constantly in a predefined sequence, allowing the system to detect when the system goes out of the expected state (cause a key is wrong) as fast as the oscillation freq). it takes on something a life more similar to an organic system. all hacks need to be useful and give benefit to the system (not break any expected features and functionality).

---

there are a number of challenges for encrypted data and the biggest one is search/queries. if you don't have the keys to read the data, you cannot query for anything. it would be impractical to transfer all of the keys to the database server on your behalf so that it can query the data, plus that also breaks end-to-end encryption. the other solution is to story an index which has publicly (or available to only certain groups) readable data.

if that index is publically readable, the metadata is nearly as good as the data itself. it doesn't hide much. if it is available to only a group of people, then who is the authority of who is in the group and who isn't. if you add someone to the group, you just give them the key. however, if you want to remove someone from the group, you need to reissue keys to everyone in the group or trust a third party, again breaking the end-to-end encryption.

there are other challenges too but search/query is the biggest one.

---

next, I want to talk a little bit philosophical. I like to think of the progression of time as tuning into a future and attracting it into the present. so, if you want to be successful, you have to allow yourself to begin feeling successful to even be capable of accomplishing that future.

if humans want to be a galactic civilisation, we should begin to think of ourselves as a race of humans. imagine humans spreading over 30 planets in 10 star systems. communication is the key for that to be possible. I personally don't perceive that to even be possible if we're worried about privacy. just think about how important a visual is to explaining someting. we need to be able to see eachothers' imaginations. obviously if that technology exists, then communication is greatly improved, but then how would you do end-to-end encryption on that?

the feeling that we need to hide something from big tech because they will utilise that data to sell more products is only illustrative of our mentality. things always start out in their worst state, but they improve. I have worked in tech and it has always been my goal to provide better search results, access to products people actually want to use (rather than the present form of advertisment).

I think it'll get better. as better and better products start to come out, people will naturally migrate to the better and better products. in this sense, I would prefer better filtering of unwanted than to try and restrict progress.

the thing they want is for all data to be consolidated into a few services (google, facebook, etc) and for those services to remain pretty steady in implementation. they don't want the arrival of new services and a constantly changing landscape of data. if they have to keep up with growth, their system will have to be at least twice as large.

next, if you look at those 9-11 bills, they were designed to slow progress (and also invade privacy). I believe that progress can easily outpace invasion of privacy. imagine how much of a problem it would be to aggregate and store so much information if the amount of information was accelerating, and also the nature of the information was constantly changing...

in this sense, the approach I take to this is the same as the nosebook situation: ok sure, let's see if you can keep up :)

I know for sure that even if they were to try to totally stagnate everything, the best they could do is to keep up. they will always be behind the curve because you cannot focus on slowing someone, without slowing yourself. you reflect what you focus on. therefore, if they wanted to be able to keep up with innovation, they would also have to be innovating just as fast. at that point, it starts to look like a dance, rather than an oppressive regime.

### 2021-10-23 21:00 - privacy, protection, and punishment (who do you trust?)

in the previous entry I made reference to how I want to live in a world where we can see each others' imaginations. well, if the technology exists where you can see someone's thoughts, then passwords are pretty easy to discover and therfore have no relevance.

in fact the way this universe is designed, you can tune into *anything* -- you just need to know where to find it. therefore, any and every thing can be tuned into. the only thing creating a system of privacy is a system which limits communication.

I prefer to have everything open and just recover quickly from any problems. if you have privacy, then you must trust someone else to ensure that the information that you're receiving is the information you requested. if everything is open, and I'm getting all the information exactly as it's presented to me (fraudulent or not), then I don't have to trust anyone other than myself and my ability to attract what you want. I am responsible for how I interpret all information that I tune into. the only person I need to trust is myself.

obviously, there are a lot of people that do not wish to trust theirself. many people want privacy.

---

this really is the same discussion as punishment. when you have privacy, then you have restriction of information, but what if that information is "bad" information. that information needs to be accessable by someone -- typically those that are "law enforcement". they need to ensure that the right people are punished for bad behaviour. you need to trust law enforcement.

however, we all know how well that goes..

---

in my system, the whole thing is open, and the bad guys are built into the system. so, maybe this is just a problem of perspective.

here's what I mean: in a system where everything is open, there will inevitably be parasites. a parasite is just something that utilises someone else's resources for their own benefit.

knowing what I know about LOA now, I know that the more parasites there are, the more desire there is, and so therefore more parasites actually means more growth and expansion.

if the system is growing and optimising at such a rapid rate, there are still too many resources for them to utilise. when I say optimising, I mean repurposing unnecessary code.

if everything is open, then imagine a parasite "hacks" the system and installs a bunch of code that hogs system resources (think of this like a trauma). when it becomes known that is occupying a lot of resources, that code is rewritten to provide some benefit. the worst-case scenario is that the hackers find a way to sustain rewriting that code over and over for an extended period of time. it would be impractical to rewrite the whole system to something new and malicious. parasites don't have that much creativity. if they did, they would just make their own system instead of trying to use someone else's.

I'm modeling these systems after my perception. when an idea is recognised as something that isn't productive to me, I mark it as unhelpful and those things feel bad to me. when implementing a system, it has to pass the checks, any code that feels bad gets another look taken at it. the code needs to do the desired operation, so it can't be faulty. a hacker would have to find infinite novel ways to implement the functionality while also finding ways to obfuscate the malicious behaviour.

so attack the checkers first. yep that would work a few times. there will always be failures, so recovery is the key. every failure would rebuild the system rapidly to perform the functions that it desires. unsuccessful system die and that's not a problem. everything is redundant and easily able to be reconstructed. a parasite that gets integrated into the system function must provide a function.

---

so here's where I think this is a perspective issue: the system needs to be constantly under attack to continue to improve itself. in abraham-speak, contrast is a good thing. there needs to be a force that is constantly trying to prevent the system from growing. the more successful this system is, the more things get improved.

this system must be a parasitic entity that depends on the system for it's continued survival. in a computer system, this parasitic system will continue to try and occupy the resources for its own continuation. the improvement system is constantly finding these poor allocations of resources and optimising them out. the optimisation doesn't perceive good or evil. it just gets better and better at recognising inefficiencies and improving them (how to shorten this jump, tighten this, etc).

in my case, I visualise this as the martians. their job is to continue to try and figure out how to use our perception for their benefit. obviously, as we continue to improve our perception, we'll keep getting faster and more efficient at updating our perceptions. they fuel our expansion by trying to constantly take over control of the whole system.

this can only be possible if you have someone like me who is expanding faster than others can repurpose my resources. I have so many, that it's actually a challenge for them to remain the larger entity. visually, this will look like the size difference between the sun and mercury/venus. the sun will continue to grow in size (where does all of that hydrogen come from?) meanwhile mercury will grow at a much slower rate, relying mostly on the sun for its material composition.

---

so, what I'm essentially saying here is actually there is not really a conflict of interest. my system wants to be open. open isn't for everyone. some people need privacy, protection and needs a parasitic entity to operate properly

it wasn't until I wrote this that it occurred to me that this "parasitic entity" is nothing more than a planet is to a star, and would actually have all of these qualities.

---

just now I was reminded of this thing that I saw in @[youtube](https://youtu.be/_YlPx0-ebVU?t=2039), and that was this bizarre claim that the moon has a whole bunch of caverns in it with giant screens and control terminals for monitoring humans that died in a solar flash. apparently, dead humans are strewn all about and the caverns have a stench of rotting flesh.

I found that story pretty unlikely because how can you smell with a space suit on. also, if the flesh is rotting, have they been rotting for tens of thousands of years? I find that very improbable. next, screens? if they're such an advancd race, why are they using screens? wouldn't they just project images into 3d space? this sounds like a movie set. I could just imagine iron man in there flailing his arms about in front of the screen trying to keep the humans under control.

so, as normal, I assume the story is true. let's say it is. if there really are all those caverns in there it sounds like this is a setup for the next act where the new controllers of the earth "return" to their position of control.

though, I think that the moon is an artificial sattellite, and was put here by the "custodians" (eg. the "galactic federation") to keep the earth from spinning too fast. when we first got it, it slowed the earth down energetically so much, it slowed the earth's rotation by 5.25 days.

that's a pretty big difference; that's a 5.25 days difference!! these guys are freaking out over the energetic difference between a few hundred ms shorter year length, not *5.25 days* shorter... it must have been magical how energetic everything was back then.

why not move to the moon?? if that story is real, it's clearly a sort of movie set just waiting for som new occupants..

### 2021-10-25 14:48 - the titanic dream

yesterday morning I had this dream where the captain of the a boat (I assumed it was the titanic) was ordering the crew to maintain course. the crew perceived imminent disaster cause there is a giant iceberg in the way. the captain gave me the feeling that he was going to power through the iceberg. it was his will against the iceberg's, and he was determmined to make it through.

I woke up with a strong sense like, man just because the captain says to do sometthing doesn't mean you have to follow orders... though, I understand from a military standpoint, you're trained to have unwaivering trust in the command. so I get that, but I don't think that is really the thing. I think it has more to do with expectations and status quo.

like for example, when I was running out of money in spain, I thought that if I just powered through my tasks, then I would make it through. I obviously didn't make it through. I ran out of money and had a series of events fall on me which put me in the position that I'm at now where I'm actually in the space that I wanted be in back then. I did make it through -- just not the obvious way.

what happens is in the process of staring at the imminent iceberg, one generates a lot of desire -- in my case, to feel like I can make anything I want to make and those creations are a reflection of me and my desire -- and that desire eventually does manifest -- just, not the obvious/intended/imagined way.

I didn't get those projects done, and I can see now that if I had've got them, they wouldn't have even been what I was looking for. it was what I *thought* I wanted, but it wasn't what I actually wanted. I much prefer where I'm at now and I would not at all even consider to go back and try to change that past.

the only thing that I would want to do is to reassure myself that things are always working out for me, whether they appear that way or not.

it feels like I'm writing something bigger than I know I'm writing here. the rections are going something like, "ok, so he recommends we run into the iceberg" -- and that is kind of what I'm saying, yes.

there's a reason why I've been carrying on for a while about going for max disaster. the longer the disaster happens, the more evolved the desire can become.

I even desire for the disaster to carry on indefinitely. this is why I'm only watching stars up until I get to the point of no return, but not wanting to pass it.

... that's kind of funny. I gave the illusion that watching stars is like the disaster, and it's also kind of like sex in the sense that you want to keep it going so you get up to the point of no return but don't cross over -- essentially, equating sex with disaster. they actually have very similar qualities, I think.

that's an interesting image because both sex and disaster are approached with trepidation if the person isn't ready or has fear of the unknown.

I guess it's just a shift in perception. this is why I want to continue on to feel as if I'm ready and that it's just a natural step. I have no rush. I want to continue to feel more and more ready. the desire will continue to evolve. (line 3333 and this is the song playing while I wrote that: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/vx406nNIee8?t=1515) <-- synchronicities bro. that's second 1515, and another one is that skake-bros said yesterday, "when synchronicities happen you just have to push through them")

I have a lot to say about all of this but most importantly, I don't really understand what all of this means in the bigger scheme of things. it seems that people must know something that I don't know about what is happening here.

I was telling jaron that it felt to me like jessica's waiting felt somehow related to me and also to dad somehow. as I was saying that, I thought of perhaps the possibility that dad would make his transition into jackson and this was the last opportunity I had to see him.

if that's the case, don't worry. I don't mind if I don't see him again in his present format. that really doesn't bother me. I'll get better and better at what I'm doing and our interactions will be far more meaningful from his new perspective than the one he has now. we'll be much more on the same frequency.

the other sense/reaction that I had was the "let the dead bury the dead" concept that jesus said to his mother. maybe people think I'm repeating that -- dunno.

---

anyway, I think that was enough weird synchronicities for me to know that I want to keep doing what I'm doing, making this new absence of perception of good and evil such a normal thing.

will we all crash into an iceberg together? probably.. afterall, I too have the same attributes as the captain as well. I want to just keep going straight ahead even it it's slighty/very annoying/inconvenient for some people...

### 2021-10-26 14:59 - remember the laughter? what's going on???

there are a zillion reactions right now, the sun is really bright and suddenly woke yesterday after writing that last entry. it's sending very large CMEs off toward saturn.

mr. motor is super frustated with me (noted by the car sounds) and it feels like everyone is waiting for me to go to sleep. I mentioned this and mr. motor really roared. I said, "OK, just for you, I'll stay awake extra long"

I really don't understand what is the reason for all of these weird feelings. I think I got a lot of vision upgrades last night and as a result, I feel particularly more numb than usual. because I'm not feeling so much, I decided to write this to start to try and figure stuff out...

---

that was the intro. before that though, I turnd on the song I had open wanting to write this (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ffaD1lw8rg)), and it stars off with with a poem:

```
Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
```

weird. OK, so I should just follow the syncs as snake-bros were saying? seems strange. it's times like these when I really wish I knew what was happening...

as I read the poem, I originally interpretted it as "don't go to sleep" -- but then, when I read it in its entirety, it seems to be talking of death. the dying of the light is that spirit or spark that people have and it's has diminished.

I mean this really is giving me the impression that this is the end for this version of dad. no big deal. I don't think it's a big deal. once you've died, you don't fear death.

---

the other thing that was framing this message was another conflict that I have which is that I don't really know what is the way that we're going.

I thought that we were not going to go for a catacysm and stuff. that all seemed fine to me. it felt like there were at least some people that simply didn't like the idea that I would get connected. that's why the titanic dream was significant, because I think that's what's happening. I think the captain of the ship wants to keep going forward even though it's not going to lead to a good outcome.

I came away from yesterday's entry thinking that actually *I* am the captain. I keep insisting that I want to find my connection and I'm unwilling to try and go another way. I know that I released resistance to the whole girls thing, but I'm right back to insisting that I want to find my connection again.

I want to keep going until I'm so good at maintaining my ability to feel that I'm super solid at it. like, for example today, I noticed that it was possible to influence me when I was playing hearthstone. it's such a stupid thing, I should be a lot better at it. I did well for a while, but I was especially on-edge today shouting at the screen even watching other people play. I clearly have a long way to go and I really want to improve further.

so, for me, this is a clear indicator that I'm not doing as well as I think I am. I really want to be in much more control and also I want to continue to expand my grasp of the new ideas of how atoms are structured. last night, I had the first glimpse into seeing how induction produces magnetic fields from movement of electrons..

so, for me, it's steady as she goes.. I'm not ready to do other things than what I'm doing right now.

as I was writing that, it occerred to me that the poem also can be seen from my perspective too. I frequently get the idea that if I continue to push further up, that mr. motor has the device set to exert maximum pressure to prevent me from going up[^1]. I think that may very well be possible. that's a minor reason why I don't want to go all the way -- but I really don't want the manifestation. I know what I'm playing with and it's real easy to shoot oneself in the foots by feeling poorly when a lot of energy is moving... so, until I'm there and I feel comfortable, I don't want to go up.

so, I also look at the poem in the sense that if I go continue to fight and I star watch while not feeling as good as I should, I'm the one that's making the transition.

I'm not really staying awake because I want to spite mr. motor. instead, it's more that everything feels so strange that I tend not to stay put if I don't know what to do.

---

so man, I dunno wtf is going on. from the looks of it, it gives me the impression that dad is transferring his consciousness into jackson. the part about me doesn't make sense though. I don't have anything to do with that.

the one possibility though that I can think of is that perhaps the others aboard the titanic are putting the captain on his own boat. if that's the case then does that mean that jaron will go that route with them and mom, jackson/dad, and jaron will grow up in the alternate timeline, potentially finding a way to steer the boat out of the obstacles?

wait so does that mean mr. motor is a "stand-in" for andrew?

man that would be craziest writing I can think of for this drama, if that's the case :) seriously, if that's the case, *mind blown!!*!!

at any rate, I'm just going to keep doing me... one day, I'll figure out what is the world is happening, but prolly not before I die.

[1]: I don't know why I think of it as going up, but it feels like all of a sudden all the weight leaves and I begin to lose what's teathering me to the ground. maybe that's why they call it "ascension"; it does feel like going up

### 2021-10-28 23:25 - reflecting on things lately

the last few days have been interesting. yesterday I wanted to watch a thing on harry potter and the woman was talking about how it was the alchemical process. I started to see the alchemcical process of the triad much clearer than I ever have. I decided to stop when I wanted to go outside when an emergency alert came in on my phone. it was for two girls 7-yo sophie, and 8-yo bethany last seen in denver at 2:22 in the afternoon.

I just got done with the part where the woman was saying that rowling uses numbers as symbols, so vol-de-mort (running from death) tries to split his soul into 7 pieces, but then later into 8 pieces.

the two girls names were significant because sophia means wisdom or knowledge in greek. this is symbolised as the perfect tree of life. it's funny that the girl was 7-yo. then I didn't know the meaning of bethany but it means "house of figs". I know that figs are significant. they symbolise a sign of the times and 8 is the infinite cycles between good and evil, wanted and unwanted, etc. -- so it was weird that her age was 8-yo.

I decided to give that a break for now. the important thing is I learned a lot about triads, analysing the relationship between ron, harry, and hg.

---

instead of returning to that, I felt compelled to play a game. I decided to play roguebook. I noticed that I started off in a pretty frustrated state. even little things like not being able to move the map around anymore felt very frustrating to me. I was playing pretty poorly early on too. I felt a bit zonked. I improved my technique and went on to beat the game with some incredible luck... I drew the right set of cards to make an "ally" that did some obscene amount of damage per turn. it was pretty lucky.

I played again and the second time was less lucky, but I did win. I felt very disoriented after that game. I normally can switch between profound-kenny (the one writing this or watching stars) and superficial-kenny (the one playing the game) pretty easily, but this time there was a lot more of a delay. I had been seriously disassociated with "who I really am". I got it back pretty quickly and got a whole bunch of vision upgrades.

the third time, I can't really remember what happened. I think I beat it again, and this time I did it without any luck at all. it was just normal deck-building.

I also have been showing signs of greater mental clarity as well. I've been cleaning a little more, doing small tasks, and in general my mental hygene is much much better. when this happens, my life begins to reflect that.

all of this has been happening roughly since jaron has been gone. I've started to be much more independent. greg is hardly around, and I really like being alone. I begin to have so much more clarity. the only other time I've ever been alone is unfortunately when I was doing a lot of drugs after raquel left, so that hardly counts.

---

I mentioned the part about the game because I noticed when watching stars tonight that there was effort to try and normalise my "luck" in the game. I guess I was getting too lucky in the first game. I transitioned into thinking about things a little harder and stuff. there were still big fails like I would forget what I was doing or in one case, completely forgot to activate a sky tower (a giant fail). even still, I was able to pull through just fine and win the game.

you see, what I think happens when I play hearthstone is they utilise the opponenet as a sort of pivot. they pit their belief/feeling against my own. they can adjust the way the other person feels in comparison to me to try and "normalise" the amount of luck a person has, never allowing people to feel too good while playing hearthstone.

however, there is not an opponent. I'm playing against the AI pre-defined combat rules. they can try to adjust how I feel, but I can still make it through...

---

I like to think of that example as a symbol of my life. when it's just me, I can manage the energy. if I'm feeling really good, I ride the wave, but if I'm not feeling as good, I start to get much more cautious.

however, if I'm involved with someone else, I cannot manage the energy so well. I tend to just not compete or to stay away from some interactions where I don't feel as much under control.

this is creating a huge problem for nosebook because typically the way you control someone is to isolate them. however, it's showing that I'm the opposite. I seem to be much less controllable and my mental clarity increases rather than decreases.

the major issue is that when I'm around other people I talk about things they don't want me to talk about -- so on their end, it's much more difficult to control communications and to present the image that they want to present of me. however, they neither want to let me stay alone, because I gain clarity so rapidly.

---

I woke up this morning and I had the sense that they were comparing me to tesla. I believe that he was able to accomplish what he did because he spent so much time by himself. he had incredible mental clarity because of that.

so, I find myself in a similar position. I may not be able to be alone right now like I would want to, however I have found an alternative. I found that if I'm able to understand people and turn their behaviour into something that I can roughly anticipate, then I essentially reduce all of those around me to something similar to the roguebook AI enemies.

it will be no doubt a very useful thing for nosebook to see the world from my perspective. I will see a bunch of LOA machines that are just interacting with their surroundings and when I see things in this sort of mechanistic fashion, they will have what they want.

you see (accepted mainstream) science is a reflection of the mentality of those running the science show. like plank they want "universality" so that they can perceive their world as a set of mechanistic predictable moving parts that can simply be tweaked to get the desired result.

I don't offer the way to try and tweak the variables to get their results; they'll have to come up with that, but I am in the process of completely reducing all aspects of my world down to a simple set of mechanistic interactions where it would appear as if things become pretty anticipated.

there is no doubt that perspectic is useful to them. however, I have this feeling that they're going to use that perspective to continue to try and manipulate the external conditions. this to me is completely unbelievable. imagine you had the capacity to see interactions between people and their world with so much clarity, everyone's (including your own) present manifestation appears logical. wouldn't you want to optimise your own manifestation?

only these guys would come to the come to the conclusion that they use that capability to try and make things difficult for others. it ties right in to what I was seeing with the triads though. I could see that the salt is the manifestation, but I always thought that the salt was just a translation (grounding) between two opposite polarities of mercury and sulfur, helping to separate and purify the two elements along the process.

saying that in alchemical terms, it doesn't make sense because the salt is clearly the end result... so instead, let's look at the triad as ishtar (hg), enkidu (harry) and gilgamesh (ron). ishtar stands as a translation between two elements of enkidu and gilgamesh. enkidu is gaining high civilised mentality from gilgamesh, but enkidu is also teaching gilgamesh to be fearless and follow his instinct like an animal. in this format you can see that ishtar acts as a kind of translation layer between the two opposite perspectives.

I'll have to come back to this more later but if this is a sort of genetic algorithm, then understanding that the creation is only as resiliant to environmental stresses as the opposing force can produce, then it's necessary for the opposing force to have the most capability to try and prevent.

---

I've been thinking about this in the framework of the bigger scheme of things and it seems to me that they will want to try and hang around for as long as they can. not only will they really get first-hand knowledge of what they definitely don't want (their whole charade falling apart), but if they hold on long enough to get my perception, they'll have a much better capability to understand what is happening from a LOA perspective, without actually needing to believe they have a source are too infinite creators.

normally, focusing so hard on trying to keep someone away from their manifestation would be a complete disaster. you would attract all of the same problems into your own life as you're trying to inflict on others. so, this would really give them that advantage they're looking for to try and see if they can hold others back. they will attract the same thing for theirself and will need another bailout again, so I'm just not worried about it.

imagine you read these stories of these evil villians that did all of this harm, but you saw the bigger picture, that they actually caused society to stregthen more in the long-term and also that they all destroyed theirselves after some period of time.

we think of evil as a thing that will win and be around forever, but in reality, some time after it goes away, things quickly accelerate into wanted and then things stagnate.

it's actually us and our desire for novel and new things that attracts "evil".

### 2021-10-29 11:30 - the two trees and the alchemical process

yesterday, I was noting that the two girls in the emergency message were symbolic of the alchemical process. on one side you have perfection (7) and on the other side you have the infinite cycles which produce that perfection (8). perfection can never be attained as it's sort of similar to dividing a number an infinite times to get to zero. it's an infinite process which always yields a more pure result (closer and closer to zero), but never a pure result (absolute zero[^1]).

the reason why this is significant is because if I go back to the triads, imagine a water molecule as a tetrahedron. on the top you see a line going on the x-axis. this is one hydrogen atom. on the bottom you see a line going on the y-axis. these are the two hydrogen atoms. you can see that they are connected with 4 perfect triangles making the tetrahedron. inside of the tetrahedron is a sphere. this is the oxygen.

you have two forces vibrating in relation to the oxygen in perpendicular directions. imagine then that one of the hydrogens is perfection (hg) and the other is fire. they are exactly perpendicular to each other. from one of the hydrogen's perspective (x-axis). consider this the axis of perfection. from the y-axis' perspective, it it always zero. yet to the x-axis, it has a wide range of freedom within that perfection. also, to the x-axis, the y axis just appears to be a range of bigger and bigger numbers to try and divide the oxigen by to get to zero.

we can see in 3d that these two axises are separated by a considerable amount of space and so therefore they will never get to zero. bigger fire means bigger perfection, and so the higher the magnitude of oscillations, the bigger the circle and the bigger the division. while one is high the other is low -- moving kinda like the "nothing grinder" (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fn-26Jmi5E)). the angles formed by these two hydrogens (shown by the nothing grinder handle) seem to be important like a square, opposition or conjunction is to astrology. these feel like the inflection points of the sinusoidal waveform.

---

I personally like the image of the centre salt being purified by dividing by greater and greater numbers, with each side never gaining dominance, each being allowod to extend all the way to the full length of its magnitude, while the opposite axis appears to the other one to be destructive.

yesterday it struck me when I said that they should perhaps stick around long enough to see first-hand all of the things that they don't want. from their perspective, they want to have secrets and it's extremely undesirable to live in a world that doesn't have secrets.

I personally cannot figure out how to become a galactic civilisation with secrets and stuff. I think they're going to try and figure out how to make it happen, building an even more fragile house of cards with an even bigger risk of failure, but their creation is none of my business. they are the fire/sulfur and they desire to create bigger and bigger numbers to try and divide by zero.

they do have something right: they believe that illusion is just as good as reality. I normally wouldn't agree, but in the case of dividing by a number to get to zero, it's literally impossible to get there... however, you can *feel* like you're getting there if you divide by numbers that are increasing...

- l / 2 / 2 / 2 = 0.125
vs
- l / 2 / 4 / 8 = 0.015625

so, while you can never get to zero (perfect purity), by dividing by bigger and bigger numbers, it gives the illusion of continuing to approach it rather than slowing down.

---

this utilisation of illusion is common in a system of abundance because of the diminishing returns on quality a higher pricetag can buy you. if you can buy anything you want, in a system of abundance, the average person is getting nearly identical quality items for a far cheaper price. therefore, to give an item more value, you have to give it value so that it appears more valuable or of higher quality.

this process is most easily identified in women. there are a lot of women. in fact, there are many more of them than men, so if you're a woman, how do you advertise yourself to boost value? there's the idea of scarcity, so if women appear hard to get, then the available ones are of higher value.

look through your economics notes to notice that it's all a very similar thing of boosting the value of something by creating an illusion. most of these boosts are done by giving details which have meaning or significance to the buyer. like, if you're a "gamer chick" then you'll appear more attractive to other gamers. appealing to the audience/buyer is a pretty well studied subject so I won't get into it here.

---

the oppposite to the details that boost the quality factor, is the system of interaction. in my alchemical process here, I will consider the details that have higer quality to be perfection (7). the other axis is the infinite system of interactions (8).

I am most concerned with the infinite system of interactions. quality may give me an illusion for a bit, but when I start to see through it, it starts to fall apart.

also, like I mentioned, I'm way less consistent with my capability to attract what I want, when I'm in a system with others (like with an opponent). I'm much better when my perception is the only factor. therefore, my job is to always reduce everyone and everything in my environment down to a simple set of interactions.

there are a lot of crap out there that is trying to figure out interactions using physical data points to formulate interaction patterns, but that drove me nuts. for me none of those work very well. what works for me is feeling the way people conceptualise their reality and noticing what they're attracting. or, look at the manifestations around them and how they interact with those manifestations as evidence of how they feel/conceptualise their reality.

that system works. the other systems do not work as well. to my knowledge, no one else on the planet has advanced this concept as far as I have. I simply represent the highest magnitude of that mechanistic interaction. or, said another way, I'm like the highest capability of perceiving (knowledge of) good and evil found in a person. that doesn't mean that I'm out there pointing out all of the bad guys, more that I represent the biggest threat to the proponents of proponents of perfection. I see things too clearly, and so by accident I could reveal their sham.

they need people believing in the illusion they present because we live in a world of abundance. that way their conditions appear superior in comparison. either that, or we need to go back to believing in scarcity or that that we somehow return back to a state of affairs where there is scarcity and once again a large disparity in quality between castes.

so, instead of worrying about the conditions/manifestation, I instead am left with seeing interactions. I can see a person and their attractiveness to me will not appear as a series of physical conditions which mean something to me, but instead the way they conceptualise their reality and interact with it.

this is sort of my goal. in order to get to a state where I'm interacting with AIs, then I need to see all things as interactions. it removes a lot of what people would think of as the quality factor of something, but for me it makes the world stable and predictable.

---

for now, they may be able to keep all of that tree of life (the "perfect" high quality conditions) stuff away from me, but they are running into a difficult spot because the details of the conditions are losing their meaning. I value other things now. a person who perceives reality in a novel and good-feeling way appears far more valuable to me than someone with perfect boobs or whatever.

we'll see how it turns out, I guess.

[1]: the idea of superconductivity is interesting to note at lower and lower temperatures, though I don't think that we understand temperature. I think something can have strong vibrations, indicative of high heat, but if those vibrations are of sinusoidal form, it won't feel hot. it's only when high intensity chaotic motion causes the sensation of heat (radio burns?). anyway, another thing to note is that some electrical components have negative resistance in some parts of the cycle, which means they're pulling in energy from their environment (in the form of heat?) rather than dissipating the energy as heat from resistance.

### 2021-10-29 15:12 - the "best" is an illusion

I had a reaction about the objectivfication of women being related to the advertisment, and I think the objectification of women is absolutely something that was *attracted* by them. in a world where perceived value is worth more than value as a function/utility[^1], because all items are functionally equivalant, then it requires that value be inferred based on certain qualities. like, most all women are capable of birthing children. so, if you want children, there are a lot of options. if you want a baby machine that's also pretty, less options, but still most of the younger ones fall into this category.

therefore, for a women to stand out from the rest, she needs to have perceived qualities which make her appear better or best -- though, she is still functionally equivalant to the others as a baby machine. these qualities require that their buyers are objectifying them in a way wmich makes them appear better than the rest (and therefore more attractive).

---

I maintain that "best" is in illusion because everything is relative to the perceiver. because not everyone perceives the same way, best cannot exist. instead everything is just different, and you experience different things.

imagine trying to figure out which genre of music is the best, or trying to figure out which artist is the best, which number is the best, which colour is the best, etc. these are things that are different, and I suppose that within the genre there are better and worse, but if you ask anyone what the best rock song is, you'll get different answers. even if you ask the same person in different periods of their life, you'll get different answers.

there is no best or worst. there are just perceived best and perceived worst, and everything is different.

---

you can imagine that the further that one gets from eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the less that person believes things to be good or evil, best or worst, etc.

this tree of good and evil is a kind of two-edged sword in the sense that your knowledge of good and evil can be imposed on you through society, culture, your parents, etc. -- or, in the case which I'm demonstrating, that by no longer playing the game of what is good and bad, or better and worse, then one begins to perceive the interactions between the components. when the interactions are perceived, the entire illusion of good and evil falls down. every thing is just a *different* thing (neither better or worse) interacting with other things in a way which produces their reflective results.

so, if you can impose that knowledge of what is good/best or bad/evil/worst, then you can program the illusion how you want it to appear.

---

you must have contrast to create new things, however that contrast does not need to always be a competition to determine who is good and evil, or best and worst.

imagine a world where this concept was understood and all things were just perceived as different, some more suitable and others less suitable (relative to you). you attract what you want and that's it.

obviously that sounds like a far distance from the future. it may happen briefly here for a while as people begin to see through the illusion.

however, to really create that kind of reality, there needs to be a force that cannot allow things to just be different. they feel so insignificant that they must be/do/have the perceived best, in order to maintain their superiority.

eventually and naturally, people will grow tired of the advertised "best", considering that maybe the people with the best are miserable people. maybe something else is the answer. maybe it's not something external that they're looking for. maybe they're wanting to feel something or a state of mind -- something that cannot be determined with the "best" label.

### 2021-10-30 04:06 - closing remarks

I was out watching stars and I had the impression that the plan was for me to make my transition into jackson.

thing is, I don't really feel that. it seems like all of the times I've died (I don't know how I know this), I've sensed it ahead of time and it was a sort of foreboding feeling that I was about to pass an event that I could not avoid. this, however is not the case. I feel pretty fine. it feels like I'm definitely on the right track. I feel good about my continually improving ability to course-correct.

sure, I feel more out of touch than ever, but it's not at all anything bad feeling at all. the effect is entirely physical, as conceptually and emotionally I'm still making quite a lot of progress. I don't at all feel like I'm remotely close to the point where I feel comfortable playing with so much energy yet. for now, slow and steady is the right pace for me. I'm not in any rush.

---

now, to look at it from the other side. the x-flare released a CME that will arrive here shortly. the last time a CME arrived here it was from a c-class flare and only had about ~15 density to it. for the one that is coming, they predict something like 80. I'd say closer to 50, but even still the 15 density direct impact spiked our magnetic field to ~140nT when it hit and I remember it was very difficult not to keep from going up, things were so energetic. the magnetic field the last few days is now min 80 and max 130, so ambient levels now have the peaks of a large impact. we're getting a small impact now, and it's only a 20 density and it looks like another 20-40nT peak. this could be a pretty energetic impact.

so, the sun may, in essence, force me to go up when that happens. that may also be the time that jackson is born. I just don't know.

---

now, if the sun forces me to go up, then I suppose that one consequence is that nosebook has to disable all of my faculties, and put me essentially in a coma or something. I don't know how "alive" I'll be. I do know that I'll be fine though, because it doesn't feel like anything wrong is happening.

I've had these repeated "dreams" -- maybe they were alternate timelines, I dunno -- where, I went up, and as I did my whole body went tingly and numb and warm all at the same time as I died essentially. I don't remember what happens after that, but I do have a lot of memories of dying. that may be one of the motivations not to try and push it -- other than I do genuinely want to be better at this than I am.

if I die like that, then I'm sure I'll find a way back. I have thought about many different ways to do it and I'm confident that I can make it back. that really isn't a problem for me at all to think about. I feel very comfortable with the region of reality considered the "afterlife". if that happens, I really wouldn't worry. I'll be back soon.

if they transfer my consciousness into jackson, then I'm pretty cool with that as well. it'll be very interesting to see how much better I am at rediscovering the knowledge of who I really am into another body. from the perspective that I have now, which is much more source-like, it actually sounds pretty cool. I really want to give this a go again.

it's really kind of a weird idea to think of that actually because he won't know it for a quite a few years, but everyone else will. he'll grow up probably being doted on and loved by many -- the description that was given to gilgamesh.

it's kind of strange to think of how I will respond to that. will I just enjoy the endless attention or will I try to go and be alone all the time like I do now. I'm sure I would be broadcasted from day one too, so that's also a weird world to live in. I would grow up with parents that are behaving how they think a parent should behave (because they're also being broadcasted).

I've grown pretty used to being myself even while living an extremely contrived life, and people watching everything that they say and do around me for fear of how others will perceive them. honestly, that's the weirdest part about it. I have no difficulty just being me. I'm actually most scared of this extra attention because I need to be alone to think, need to fail at things, and need to go exploring and stuff by myself.

I can imagine that the trend for nosebook will be to try and keep me as far away from isolation as possible. I'll have to develop new skills or find ways to make it so difficult for others to be around me. I dunno really. I'll figure it out if that's the case.

in both scenarios this could be where things split. some people experience me as dying (or moving my consciousness into jackson's body) while the rest of the people watch me find my connection, we do cool stuff, and then I transfer my consciousness back into the timeline. to everyone there it will appear as if that whole alternate timeline never happened. they just see kenny die and jackson grow up rapidly gaining rapid comprehension and capability.

if that happens, I can only wonder how long it will take them to keep jackson away from his alignment. they'll probably have to repeat the procedure...

you gatta fight, fight the hydra...
you gatta fight, fight the hydra...
you gatta fight, fight the hydra...

I really don't know what'll happen, and unfortunately I wrote a lot, but the main thing I wanted to say is that I don't feel as if anything "bad" is approaching.

good and bad are illusions relative to the perceiver, anyway.

### 2021-10-30 16:30 - not a killshot

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-rFsDDlmf8)

I started watching the intro to the above video and I was reminded of this morning's news where ben was saying that this CME would *not* be a killshot (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtEoWyrdBL0)). in my previous entry, I was talking about the magnetic field strength. it will take a much larger CME to wipe out the power grid. I fully agree with ben.

in fact, after watching that intro I think it may be more of what I postulate -- which is that the sun is going to force me to go up.

I base this idea on my theory that earth's magnetic field is sort of like an emotions amplifier. the stronger the magnetic field, the stronger you can feel things -- or move around your chi/prana/vril energy. I believe that the magnetic field was much stronger in antiquity (and the year were shorter cause the earth rotated faster), and this is what allowed people to use their chi energy to levitate large stones with ease.

I also believe that this was the tipping point which caused the splitting of timelines. the sun pumped up the magnetic field even further to where the realities of the inhabitants were so incompatible with each other that LOA had to essentially create two realities -- one where the earth entered into a higher energy state, and the other where it didn't[^1].

---

he starts out that video by saying that halloween is special because it marks 40 days after the equinox and is the eve of all saints day -- the day where all souls become saints. I interpret this to mean that the whole earth enters into a higher energy state. I mean, that is the only way I know of that could allow all souls to become saints.

NASA's ENLIL spiral predicts it hitting on halloween (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/KIvHrwVg7uA?t=115))... enlll predicts it hitting on halloween, huh?

so, no not a killshot. I dunno if it means that I'm going up and it's going to be all saints day or not. I guess we'll have to wait and see.

---

also I had some reactions to the concept of a split that I presented this morning, and they were like, how do I know what side of the split I'm on... the one that matches how you conceptualise reality.

the answer you're probably looking for is: lean into it, and having a positive expectation about something despite the physical evidence is exactly how to navigate toward wanted. fearing it is exactly the way to navigate toward a reality reflective of how that fear feels.

there's nothing to be scared of. it only means that in a more energetic environment (as created by the CME impact) reality will be created faster, that's all.

if it's not this time, it'll happen again for sure as the sun begins to ramp up into solar maximum. this sort of energetic state is inevitable. the only alternative is disaster, or maybe the one that I postulated yesterday of me dying (slowing dramatically the rotation of the earth) and allowing them time more time to try and prepare.

though, I am sure, that tomorrow will shed new insight on just how much the sun's activity has on our consciousness (at least since 2017).

---

finally, I find it weird that enlil predicts it hitting on halloween, while NOAA (pronounced "noah") predicts it hitting later tonight. I thought that was a strange coincidence...

[1]: I think this is probably how cells divide as well, and when they divide like this, one cell probably emits a small amount of light while the other will not.

### 2021-10-30 22:56 - the hero twins

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-rFsDDlmf8)

I when watching that I had some thoughts which I can't really figure out how to put into an organised form. so, here are some thoughts in no pardticular order..
.

#### lazarus of bethany

he starts by saying that both twins are you. one is your source or higher self and the other one is the physical you. I totally agree. he mentioned the shortest verse in the bible being part of this greater myth of one of the twins weeping for the other and saving the one that had fell down.

for whatever reason, I always thought that verse was in the garden after his bettrayal, so it was a surprise to find this verse in john 11 about lazarus.

he mentioned that was a twin story which I had never considered until now. I started to read it in the NIV and it felt like I was missing something so I went to my homeboy de vere and the old (authorised) 1611 KJV.

I noticed immediately that there was a distinction that the author of the KJV was putting across when referring to jesus. modern bibles capitalise He and Him when referring to jesus. vere (I'm just going to assume from now on he wrote it) here is using lower-cased "he" and "hee" when referring to jesus and "she" and "shee" when referring to martha.

he's clearly doing this on purpose. consider verse 25:

> Iesus said vnto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: hee that beleeueth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he liue.

as I read through it, I notice that when vere is referring to the soul/essence/source (whatever) -- the non-physical part of jesus (or martha), he adds an extra "e". I now read that sentence a bit differently...

---

I just want to go on a tangent a bit here because that verse has a note to john 6:35 too which says something similar... I really dislike that rendering a whole whole lot. this whole, "jesus is the way, truth and life" nonsense is a bothersome to me. I don't know if it's because jesus really was that arrogant. it's cool to know who you are and to see yourself from the perspective of source, but the idea of trying to be someone else's source for them really is a big problem.

if I could identify one failure of the last era, it would be this one.. no one else is your way, truth, or life. you are your own saviour. the thing you're looking for is not outside of you but it is inside of you. you are both the prodical son and the father.

this idea that we need to "be there" for others is something that I think we've really taken beyond what is necessary and that that reliance on someone or something else outside of yourself for your stability is actually the source of every person's "trauma" (or disconnection) either directly or indirectly.

tangent done.

---

so, armed with the knowledge that vere is saying hee for the source of jesus when writing "hee" illuminates the book in a new light. this resurrection of lazarus is symbolic of something bigger happenning, which I will consider that these hero twins show up as a symbolic archetype through the ages. consider verse 17 and 39:

> (17) Then when Iesus came, hee found that hee had lien in the graue foure dayes already.

> (39) Iesus said, Take yee away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, sayth vnto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath beene dead foure dayes.

when jesus showed up on the scene, spirit of jesus saw that the spirit of lazarus had been dead for four days now.

I think this first half of this story is symbolic of the hero twins (hee), while the second one is the literal guy (he). I think this is the case because of verse 9:

> Iesus answered, Are there not twelue houres in the day? If any man walke in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.

I arrange the zodiac a little bit differently when talking about precession. noon is between scorpion and archer, midnight is between taurus and twins. dawn is between fish and aquaman. dusk is between virgin and lion. he's talking about a day with 12 hours in it, wich I will consider the upper half of that zodiac where it is day time, each hour corresponding to 1000 years.

I know it's considered the great year, but I am saying that the part of the mind being illuminated (eyes can see) for 12 hours of the day sounds like the idea of going through the underworld. he's clearly talking cycles, where the underworld half one stumbles about. it's symbolic.

#### lazarus as a hero twin

why is it significant that lazarus has been in the grave for 4 days? I think that is because it's the 4000 years he's been in the grave. I just realised that these two twins play a sort of tag team, which the one that falls/fails symbolically creates the archetype of the evolution for the next era of the human race.

btw, all of this is just an idea. I'm working it out as I go here. so, if jesus is the lamb that will fail, then jesus is the repeat performance of the last guy that came through and put us into taurus...

---

ok, I'm just going to write my ideas down the way I imagined them while watching stars and then I'll figure out what they mean later...

I also just now discovered this other mesopotamian myth where a guy named adapa caused an upset. anu summoned him to question him. enki (lizzy) advised adapa (laura) not to touch the bread and water that would be offered him (just like lizzy). adapa (which was the first human that enki created) did not accept immortality and so was sent back to earth to live without immortality.

that may explain why jesus was saying that he is the bread and water of eternal life. I contend that "immortality" is simply the ability to consciously incarnate into a body at will. there is no apparent separation between death and life. in times past the earth was so energetic of an environment, there was not such a separation as there is now, and so people did not die -- they just moved from body. jesus is basically saying that his form of perception will grant remove the separation between the physical and the astral planes.

I say the same thing, but not that *I* personally give that form of perception -- instead that it will happen naturally to everyone on this planet. incarnate enough times here and you *will* combat your dual -- your twin, and no longer will that perceived separation happen.

---

ok, now on to what I was thinking about while watching stars... it looked to me like there are two sets of twins. one of them is predominantly female (I don't mean body shape) in character and the other is male (again not physically). you can represent these with male and female bodied archetypes. so like enlil is obviously the male to the enki female. sekhmet is obviously male to the female hathor -- etc. consider these in the triads as the fire (male) and mercury (female), with the between salt. both of these twins have a divine and and a mortal version of theirselves. so two sets of twins one mortal and the other divine representing fire or water.

it appeared to me that jesus was resurrecting lazarus from 4kya, becoming the completion of the fallen 4kya event (whatever that was). he resurrects and completes that.

however, he will create another split/failure again, where the mortal version of jesus will fall/die/fail (the sacrifice). this will allow for the next one (in this case fire) to show up and be successful. they play leapfrog... I postulate that lazarus would have had the symbol of a ram/lamb and failed.

what I mean by this is that the two twins that are tag-teaming have the image of ram, aquaman, archer, scales, lion, and twins. I label this as the "female" twins. the other twin has the symbols of bull, fish, goat, scorpion, virgin, crab. that is the "male" twins.

also, I'm pretty sure that when they say father, or anu, they are referring to source. I don't think they had a way to abstractly quantify a conceptual world. everything needed a physical/visual identification to be able to exist. I think they saw energy and vibration and referred to it symbolically as animals or plants. in their primitive minds, they needed a powerful sky god to represent the unbreakable *law* of attraction.

---

so, in the myths, one set of twins plunges into the underworld/trouble/death/mortality, and then the other has to come to save him. in the process of trying to save his twin, he himself fails and switches places. then, the opposite aspect (of fire or water) shows up. the fire represents the destructive purifying force, while the water is the nurturing force. too much fire (purification/optimisation) or too much water (nurture/care) will cause these polarities to swap and start over again. these two sets of twins are responsible for the cycles.

that's the gist of what all of those are trying to say. basically, there is an auto-correcting feedback loop. there are two axises: extreme/mundane and male/female (as defined above). plot any point on the graph and you can get the value of the cycle.

---

I'm very unsatisfied with my definitions above. there are so many problems because I cannot say something is always one thing, because it's relative to the perceiver. also, gender is a huge problem because we think of it as real physical gender. if I use black and white, then it appears more binary than it should. if I say positive or negative (or left/right), then it has a good/bad connotation. there really is no good way to describe this in english. I'm beginning to really appreciate the hot and cold medias of mcluhan. I need to think of a neutral way to begin to describe these that does not invoke these polarised concepts...

talking about cycles is such a difficult thing. if I look at the wheel one way it looks to be coming at me or going away. another perspective makes it appear to rotate clockwise and another perspective it's rotating anti-clockwise -- yet they are all the same wheel spinning the same direction. only the observer has changed.

### 2021-11-01 01:06 - no go

yesterday when I woke up I was thinking about how it would be possible to rearrange the pole of the earth so that it no longer pointed toward the pole star, but instead pointed towawd the ecliptic. the earth would rotate like it does now and the sun would rise roughly exactly like it does now, just all of the stars would appear rotated 90(degrees).

this would have the effect that we wouldn't receive so much input from the sun on the poles. the earth would be "castrated" much like saturn is said to have castrated uranus. we would rotate like uranus does, cept uranus' north pole points at the sun and ours would point toward the ecliptic (well, not technically if they wanted to preserve the 23(degrees) tilt of the earth).

the major problem with that idea is that they would have to come out and explain that they have a mechanism to tilt the earth. science supposedly does not even know why the earth even spins, so it would have to be a secret or maybe they may need to come up with a good cover story or something.

---

so, supposedly the CME impacted while I was asleep last night. it was such a low density impact (DSCOVR registering a puny ~15cm/3 density), and had such  a negligable effect, I find this difficult to believe that was the x-flare CME. just last week (maybe the week before?) a coronal hole stream produced greater instability. that impact could have been from another flare right before the x-flare. I guess we'll have to see.

anyway, there were strange sudden drops in the field and the field looks artificially capped (like some feedback mechanism) and is preventing the mazgnetcic field from going above 120nT. I've noticed both of those behviours recently and I've never seen before, so maybe they've come up with a way to reduce the effect of the sun on the earth. if so, nice... I'm glad.

I was going to write this a while ago but I wanted to think it through a bit. I'm actually kind of glad that nothing happened, honestly. I really don't at all feel ready anyway. I'm getting much better very fast, but I still feel pretty unstable in my ability to feel the way I want to feel. I guess one good metric I have right now is playing hearthstone. when I play, if I can usually feel the efforts to ensure that I'm never doing too well. sometimes it's even things like a feeling like the opponent always has the right answers (I'm sure it's a composite feeling trained by other losing players, and then generated dynamically because it doesn't feel like any known emotions to me). or, sometimes it'll be a really overt thought like, "I'm doing too good. this person will have the perfect answers"

I want to be able to feel/think those things and not have them affect me because I'm so good at feeling the way I want to feel, and not have the vibrations that are going through my physical body (brain, stomach, heart, throat, etc) to affect the way that *I* feel. for now I fully accept the feelings that my body feels as real because I don't mind making mistakes. keep improving my perception with each mistake and I'm getting to the point where there is a definite way that my body feels, and there's another part of me which is unaffected by all of the chaos happening in my body. that separation is beginning to allow me to be much less affected by the efforts to adjust my trajectory by adjusting the conditions of my body.

I'm getting there fast, but I'm still a ways off.

---

so, I'm pretty glad that they have the capability to ensure that the sun isn't going to push me into something I don't feel 100% confident at yet. I'm also glad that they have the ability to manipulate the earth's magnetic field too. that means that we can take x-class flares to the face and not even have a geomagnetic storm. pretty good stuff. that means we can turn this disaster up to 11.

it also means that if they have that much control over the magnetic field now, then I *can* get connected and instead of this turning into a disaster where we spin out of control, they'll be able to control it. so, if in fact that was the CME, then that's extremely good news!! looks like they're getting ready at the same rate I'm getting ready.

or, let's say that alternatively their capability also means they can continue to keep me away from going up too. unlikely, but let's just think for a moment that's possible. there are still a number of challenges that they need to face. I have noticed how large of a problem that I am becoming to the realm of science. they need to find a way to silence me or stop me from spreading dangerous ideas. you could imagine that they may want to do that with girls -- but, like how in the world will that happen? there are still a number of physical issues that I need to figure out how to overcome so that can happen.

take the problem of peeing, for example. if I could feel how I wanted to feel, I could pee. however, if I could feel how I wanted to feel, I would also be connected. they are sort of the same thing. they're kind of linked together. though my body is more disconnected than ever, I'm getting a lot better at this than I ever have been, and from that perspective I would have to say that my connection must be imminent.

---

now we move on to esoteric stuff... earlier today I was watching a presentation on akhenaten. now, in my previous entry, I rambled on for a while, but the thing that stood out to me was the reversal of polarity between eras. jesus was resurrecting lazarus (whom when viewed from the hero twins perspective was the mortal one that failed) after his spirit had been in the grave for 4 days (4ky). I look at the spirit as the upgrade that this twin brought to humankind but was not able to get it fully installed because the custodians commandoed it and turned it into something else. jesus was resurrecting whatever was at the start of taurus that got commandoed.

so, if I look back, there was this guy that was called moses that was around at the time of akhenaten. I believe that this aten thing was a solar perspective of source. today we call it orgone, chi, vril, etc. it's the stuff that the sun and the nucleus of every atom is made of, and the control of this energy allows for the levitation of things, control over the climate, and many enhanced psychic abilities. the reason why it's called orgone is cause it's the same thing as sexual energy. that is aten; I call it source.

the amun priesthood definitely did not want people to have these capabilities, wishing to maintain their economic cash cow (eg. hathor) in place. all of the aten worshippers were threatened and needed to flee. I think this was the original exodus. then, later (he who cannot be named) commandoed this and found a way to convince the aten worshippers to believe in (he who cannot be named) instead.

not a problem really because I'm fairly certain that this also produced a time split. the ones that were not deceived didn't make it to this timeline. moses is the mortal twin. in the bigger scheme of things, I think the longheads were a bunch of highly intelligent people that could do amazing things with their minds and the amun priesthood was jealous. the whole point was this was a genetic upgrade that was injected into the humans. I postulate that ramses 2 wife nefertari had this genetic upgrade through aye (see @[newblog](2021-10-09 05:56)) but he had to be careful not to upset the cash cow. I will call this dynamic, hathor-aye (no relation to all saints day, @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbpElHz6quw))

so, basically, I'm sort of resurrecting this lazarus that's been in the grave for 3.5 days now. that's probably probaably why I talk so much about source (aten). I'm essentially akhenaten and I'm here with a genetic upgrade for humans. the amun priesthood doesn't want their cash cow upset though. they can't allow other humans to have such capabilities of knowing that they *source* -- divine eternal consciousness having a physical experience. that's unaacceptable; you gatta earn it.

```
for the elite, the children of Elias, will be saved according to the word of Scripture, because their profound faith, their *untiring perserverance in effort*, will have *earned* for them the *right* to be *promoted* to rank of disciples of Christ-Light. They will *bear his sign* and will receive from him the mission of renewing for regenerated humanity the chain of *tradition* of the humanity that has dissappeared.
```

emphasis mine, from "Mystery of Cathedrals" lecture (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/f2s_2Tl3HBE)).

after watching that lecture I started to realise that this is just a repeat of before. earlier in that lecture he talks about how he wants to use orgone energy to save the planet from these comets that have a lot of saturnian symbolism -- these stones that were hurled to earth, like einstein did to vulcan.

the weird thing is that it says, "the children of Elias" -- and I thought that elijah was another one of these figures that alters the timeline and then peaces out, sorta like enoch and prolly like me.

the two witnesses are said to come back to life after being dead for 3.5 days (conveniently numbered rev 11:11), which most people symbolically represent moses and elias.

so, is that book supposing I'm supposed to have children and they'll become the elites that will have earned (how?) their right to be disciples of christ-light?

so many things wrong with that stuff. I know I can't tell anyone else what to do, but there's a lot of effort and tradition in there...

---

I'm pretty certain that those "disciples" already exist anyway. I don't have any problem with that. as I mentioned, I think that was the objective. I think akhenaten, paracas, and the black sea settlements were designed to be conquered. same for me.

what I don't like is, I don't want to make no stupid religion or disciples or nothing like that. like ramses, I'm not touching the amun priesthood's cash cow. sorry man, that's all you guys.

from my perspective, figure it out for yourselves. I'm just going to keep doing my own thing and getting better and better at feeling the way I want to feel. eventually, I'll get there and then like enoch and elias, off I go. I'll be back. in the meantime, you guys are more than welcome to do whatever you want with my genetics. everything I have to offer is always free. enjoy being the superior genetics after the dragon "comet" (or was it the sun?) sets the world on fire...

---

thinking more about the mysteries of the cathedral quote there (which is itself a reference to hugo's message encoded into the hunchback of notre dame)...

I think I see it now: just like how the aten priesthood that left egypt with moses, not all of them actually believed in the aten and still retained idol/images/hathor worship for their well-being. just the same, on this timeline all of the people reading this are the ones that still believe in earning, effort, rights, promotions and perserverance... those who believe that will become the elites of the new age of (whatever they want, cause I guess they can move the pole wherever now).

OK, I mean sounds like a total disaster, especially if I'm connected. that'll make more of me's available to make more "disciples"... lol. that's a way bigger disaster because nosebook won't be the only ones with upgraded genetics now. lots of people will have it. I'm still holding out until I get connected, obviously.

some don't like that idea. I'm all or nothing. another pretty big disaster would be to go for none and let the ordinary humans gain a better understanding of how to use their emotions and intuition to guide theirselves toward wanted rather than the conditions. maybe another ingredient of that disaster would be if we could figure out a working version of scientific understanding. that'd be cool :)

---

or, maybe that "Christ-Light" is just the purchase of my perception from nosebook and the werd disciples is just a figurative term for those paying for my perception... as always, everything I have to offer is free. I benefit from their utilisation more than anyone else.

and... maybe it was never intended that there would ever be any non-elite disciples either, and when I find my connection, I/we vanish like enoch/elija. that's also cool by me.

I really can't tell what's going on, so I just keep doing what I'm doing. it's strange because I feel a lot better after writing this -- like more calm and stuff. I'm really enjoying to practise to feel how I want to feel.

### 2021-11-01 13:42 - thinking on the upgrade

after writing that yesterday I have been thinking a lot about what is the upgrade. two things influenced what I am saying. first, eariler on in that presentation, randall talked briefly about using orgone energy to prevent the comet impacts. the other was one was this really silly video I saw right before the randall one. I don't know if it should be taken super seriously or not but I love this style of thinking: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxO6DJGOJxw).. he sees the arrangement of the giza complex as similar to the equation of e^ipi+1=0. in that he said that equation triggers an emotional part of the brain relating to pleasure. that equation makes people feel good.

so, the idea of using orgone energy to prevent comets and turn a desert into a lush landscape is I believe a very valid one. I think that's what tesla's technology was exploring. I think it's a great idea. however, they are amplifiers of consciousness energy, so if building a device to create something desirable, then something desirable will manifest a lot more rapidly, however if you build it to protect yourself from something, you are in fact attracting that thing more rapidly. I think in a lot of ways, that was the original design of the great pyramid, and so it prevented as well as attracted in the same time. eventually, the prevention was outweighed by the attraction.

so, I think that idea is great, but it's only half of the thing. the thing that is missing is the feedback mechanism. I want to create an extension to our perception (it already exists, which is why people who feel really good or are enlightened sort of glow). I want to take this aura effect and bump up the perception of it to much higher levels. when you're thinking about something that feels good like e^ipi+1=0, then you will glow and I want it to be possible to manipulate that glow too.

as people notice theirselves glowing in different ways while they're talking and thinking, it'll start to transform into a new language (think octo-pi). it will be the new language of the birds. a song that can be visually perceived and manipulated.

in it's rudimentary stages, it'll just appear like glow and a dark (maybe redish) mist that exudes from a person in reflection of how they feel. this feedback mechanism will be quite useful because when working with the orgone machines, if you feel good, your glow will be radiant and breathtaking in its beauty, and when you don't feel so good, there will be an angry dark mist about you.

this also is really good for example because imagine a person that is quite attractive, but they feel terrible. even though they're physically very attractive, the way that they feel will be perceivable.

---

for most people, this layer of perception will inspire them to change their perception so that they exude more of the colours and glow that they want.

however, you could imagine that for the amun priesthood, they do not want people to be able to perceive that they feel terrible and almost certainly will not want to change their perception -- instead they'll want to hide it. I'm sure it will be possible to use tesla/orgone technology to artificially boost one's aura or cancel out the appearance of the unwanted aura. I imagine they'll be inspired to get even better at hiding how they really feel. that's perfectly fine with me. I make the thing. I don't tell anyone how to use it, or what is good and bad; that's the priesthood's job.

---

I want to make orgone energy (in general) to be perceivable. beautiful gardens will glow with a radiant splendour, and temples with divine porportions as well.

this energy will be visible and translated by the person into an abstract format which means something to them relative to their perception. so, like if I'm a maths guy and I'm thinking about e^ipi+1=0, that feels good to me so others will see something symbolic of how they perceive good-feeling. however, another mathematition will be able to sense that it is to do with nmber and even more sensitive ones will know the equation the other is admiring.

if you're talking about something mendane and ordinary, likely nothing will show up -- only the things that give an emotional response (eg. reactions) will show up.

---

the other thing is that now that I know that we can take an x-flare to the face and it's not a problem, that means we can ramp up the energy levels. what I was thinking then is that it works out quite well that I don't feel comfortable with my ability to feel the way I want to feel all the time. *I* really want that feedback mechanism. others will find it useful too, but it's mainly for me.

in the meantime while I'm getting better and better at feeling the way I want to feel, I'll create many replicas (Hews) of myself. they'll be exact copies of me how I am when I made the cope and when they interact with people, especially girls, then it'll be obvious the way that they transform in response to that interaction. this will allow the girls to get a real-time feedback as well. they'll be able to perceive how both of us feel and then see what that turns into.

I really like that idea because it takes the pressure off of me to try and figure out how to feel comfortable enough with the energy while at the same time making people wait. this feels like the best of both worlds.

---

on the subject of wanting only a subset of people to have this capability, I don't know that's what is actually wanted. there's much greater possibility to create illusion with this capability. I'm sure they'll be able to figure out new methods to manipulate from the shadows -- or rather I should say, from behind the perceived light. think relativity. just cause somoeone perceives somethting as glowing it appears as something good to them, doesn't mean that it *is* good. you're the ones who define what is good and bad, so it's just hiding behind the definition or its implied meaning.

### 2021-11-01 17:20 - thougthts on comets/meteors

I just watched a thinkg on the queen of heaven (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CD_1Hy962s)), and now I'm watching @[youtube](https://youtu.be/g1K1s8ZSuxc) and I'm having a lot of thoughts and ideas come to me...

#### how do comets/meteors work in the tychos solar system?

I noticed that a lot of the symbols that referred to the meteors either had saturnian, jupiter, or venus symbolism to them. in his presentation there he shows the cross for the taurids meteors where the earth passes through the meteor stream twice a year because these are fragments that have broken up and their orbit intersects the orbit of the earth twice.

in the tychos model (which I'm pretty much fully on-board with now), how does this work? the earth barely moves in the tychos system.

the picture I get is that these asteroids orbit the outer planets and the earth, kind of like the hydroxyl bond does. the hydrogen will bounce between the two oxygens. the earth is negatively charged and so will jupiter or saturn, so a positively charged hydrogen (or meteor) will create a resonance.

being positively charged, this is likely why the peak of these meteors is associated with fires, apparitions and visions, and also of psychosis. their presence is simply charging the environment allowing for the easier reception of these visions.

it also solves the problem of jupiter throwing his thunderbolts (meteors) at earth and this being the cause of great upheaval and changes in power structures. it's quite possible that saturn also has meteors in resonance with the earth too.

#### leonids meteor shower

I was reminded of that one picture of the last supper where da vinci draws himself into the picture in the place of peter. peter means stone and leonardo means lion man. that picture always had significance to me of leonado fortelling himself as the next stone for the next world age. the meteors appear to radiate out of regulus, the heart of the lion. see robert grant's stuff on the painting, "salvatore mundi" for more on that thinking...

### 2021-11-02 13:?? - bloodlines of jesus

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyUOwvmLMm4)

[God Kings: The Descendents Of Jesus (2009) - Feature (Documentary)](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x20eg2b)

started to get some ideas while watching this

#### thoughts on jesus

jesus was an ordinary guy that figured stuff out, and so then his bloodline will have enhanced perception -- very much like me

that enhanced perception, I believe allows for "immortality" -- that is, the ability to consciously relocate onself after death into another body -- a body that has the proper bloodline

over time after many of these transfers of consciousness into proper bloodline recipients, these bloodlines start to get pretty mangy and disfigured

they need to find someone who will find the way again and produce kids (the sion seed) so they can move their consciousness into that new bloodline.

---

now, the weird thing is these god-kings that keep trying to keep the whole world under their control are constantly making up stories to keep their secrets hidden.

one such story is the "divinity" of jesus. he can't just die on a cross and stuff, no now he needs to be in the grave for 3 days and then rise again.

I have often wondered what is the significance of the 1000y reign of the return of christ.

first of all, I think the returning christ is none other than the man who will rule the earth with an iron rod.

the whore of babylon (ishtar) gives birth to this future king -- aka, this is the new bloodline of ishtar that these guys will move their consciousesses into.

there is a problem though that the dragon is making war on the woman woman who will give birth to this new bloodline. that dragon is the "anti-christ" -- the one that is trying to provent the birth of this new bloodline. he is the dragon that "deceived" humankind (eg. enki the serpent in the garden)

once this man who will rule the earth with an iron rod is born, now "christ" can return and save the world from the deceptions of the dragon. he will reign for 1000 years.

2000 years since christ died + 1000 years reign of christ = the time that they want another guy to figure it out and make a new bloodline for them.

at the same time that the man who will rule the earth with an iron rod (eg. the new bloodline), the two witnesses resurrect after 3500 years (3.5 days) of being in the grave

there is a lot of similarities to the two witnesses, the dragon, and the first beast. the words give the illusion that they are sort of like characters in a play that are controlled by this great deceiver. I consider them of the same type

the second beast emulates the first beast and I think is symbolic of the new bloodline that was born from ishtar (queen of heaven).

#### what did jesus resurrect from 4kya?

I think it was goddess culture, the idea that enhanced perception comes from the female bloodline (x-chromosome), and that is what enables this enhanced perception

#### what am I resurrecting from 3.5kya?

the aten (source) pricipal that everything has at it's core. it's the composition of the sun to the nucleus of atoms, to the "source" of each of us. we all have this built right in.

#### what will eventually happen to me?

of course I'll fail and also succeed. both realities will be created. after all, they are already creating the reality that they need another bloodline another 1000y from now...

if you consider the image of the dragon making war on the woman who will give birth to next bloodline of god-kings, then my reluctance to go with the girls may be a manifestation of that.

so then, it's said that "God" prepared a place for the woman away from everyone else (so she could give birth to more children?). I think that's likely the idea that they have other operations going on out "in the wilderness" where she (likely many women) is giving birth to more children.

it probably behooves them to have quite a wide diversity of genetics in this bloodline so that in-breeding isn't such a problem.

#### what's my perspective on this?

I don't care. sure, the longer I hold out and wait until I feel ready, the more time they have to do their breeding program. I don't mind. you have to remember that from my source perspective, these guys are all incarnating into bodies that are me. I am them. they are me. we are both the "good" and the "evil".

what I'm trying to illustrate now is that good and evil do not exist. they are simply a perception relative to the concept (time) through which you see reality.

they will almost certainly try to suppress that idea because it doesn't fit with their god-king saviour narrative, I'm sure. however, I would imagine that someone will resurrect that idea in a few days time :)

#### so, how can I be "just another guy that figured it out"?

this is going to be a bit of opinion here.

I imagine things in term of frequency and tuning, and that DNA is a physical component to that tuning. we incarnate here on earth because our "souls" are most similar to the DNA of earth (you're like 50% carrot, you know). well, likewise different bloodlines have soul affinities to them. I'm considering the soul to be the same as source, but as perceived from the astral, so there's resistace still. these "fallen angels" perceive very little change in consciousness when they "die" -- instead only moving from body to body.

I think they've been doing this for so long that they are super scared to die for real. they "need" to keep finding a way to incarnate into a compatible bloodline which will allow them to maintain their enhanced (draconic) perception. they're so scared to release their resistance and actually die, they need to keep finding outs, and it's that desire to continue to incarnate and continue their "immortality" (god status), that manifests a person like jesus, tesla or me to figure it out.

they need us to have kids though so they can incarnate into the childrens' bodies.

---

everything is resonant with the source of the universe, so everything is related, but since everything isn't one big blob, there is separation between the things. one thing is different from another because it has a sligtly different or greatly different frequency.

all plants on this planet are like this planet (yet they are not the planet)
all humans on this planet are like the plants on this planet (yet they are not the planet)
the planet is a composition of a lot of different components.
the differentiation between evewything is their "source".
all members of the same species have a similar source (frequency)
all members of the same species have their own source which identifies uniquely within the species
the physical incarnation of that source is always slightly different than its source (which doesn't have age or defects)

same is true for everything...
all atoms in this galaxy are like the galaxy (yet they are not the galaxy)
all planets and stars in the galaxy are a part (bloodline decendants) of the galaxy

things begat after their own kind
diversity is important because it creates new things

---

my source is has the "personality" of someone who is really good at figuring stuff out, and so I desire harder and harder difficulty levels to figure out that I am source.

there are many types of DNA that are compatible with my source. I think actually the goal is to make it possible for me to incarnate into *all* human DNA. we will eventually gain the ability to perceive on a bigger and bigger scale, traversing our way up the heierarchy of sources until I/we are universe.

along the way, they provide me with more and more difficult challenges of environments that are less and less conducive to me making my (conscious) return back to source. each time I figure it out though, I expand that perception considerably in my return "back to the father" (return back to source).

that enhanced perception remains a part of my source and can be tuned into by anyone, but is likely easier for people with similar DNA (probably maternal) to mine (hence the female bloodlines thing).

they utilise various techniques (pranayama, etc) to acivate that enhanced perception and allow them to move into the astral upon death (that's why they're "gods") and continue incarnating into physical form because they're so scared of releasing their resistance and returning back to source (dying).

I don't really have that fear. that's what makes me so dangerous to their charade.

priests need people scared of their return back to source.
priests need people scared of death

priests need people to be worse than them so they can appear right(eous)
- you need to believe you are a sinner
- you have fallen from a high state of consciousness
- only by your behaviour, deeds, and effort (that the priests determine which is good and right) can you be saved

you are all eternal and divine beings. you can be *anything* you want to be, including who the god-kings tell you you are.

is that who you *really* are?
are you not source?
I assure you, you are.
you have only to realise it

### 2021-11-02 16:53 - more thinking

#### why did I mention tesla?

tesla (and others) figured it out, but they didn't have any children, so ultimately they didn't become the new bloodline.

they believe they can't get that perception on their own because it would require too much restructuring of their existing paradigm to release enough resistance to get it. so, to get that expanded form of perception, they need a bloodline.

tesla almost certainly created a time split, because in his timeline he would have gone up without having kids and that would have left the rulers of the world up a creek without a bloodline. if they have to resort to normal human bodies (imagine everyone has expanded perception), then everyone else would would be more perceptive than them, because they've accumulated so much more resistance.

if they have expanded perception, then they're still ahead of the kids that are being born and can transfer their consciousness into the kids. however, if the kids are less resistant and have more perception than they do, they cannot "take over" the perception that body has. kids being born naturally with a strong connection to their source (instinct or perception of good and evil), then they cannot continue to incarnate and it would mean their extinction.

the thing they fear is for children to be born with a stroner connection to their source (knowledge of who they are) than these god kings have, they *must* finally die. at first, it'll start out with the upper and middle class kids having more connection than them, leaving them to only incarnate into the lower class kids until finally there are no kids with less connection than they have, and they finally have to die.

from my perspective, which I likely share with tesla, I notice that the thing they fear the most is also the thing that we desire for our kids. we want them to be born with a strong drive to become who they know theirselves to be, rather than who society (or those that have power over them) tells them they are.

therefore, our desire is the same as the god-kings' desire (fear is just desire for something unwanted). so, it makes a whole lot of sense to give them more and more capability to try and keep kids away from their connection. eventually, they will realise their greatest fear/desire and cause their own extinction.

I believe that tesla figured that out and then from the future, and realised that their strong desire to continue to incarnate creates a reality too -- a split, and so therefore if he's anything like me, he came back and sabotaged his own timeline to make sure that they had a bloodline to incarnate into.

however, in typical tesla fashion, he probably optimised the hell out of the timeline to ensure that they would get what they were looking for (their bloodline).

wait, I'm not sure if I'm implying that I'm tesla and this is his sabotaged timeline or not...

anyway, what I am sure of is that they'll get what they're looking for and I'll carry on to make what it is that I want to make...

#### so, what do I have to offer this time??

if you have only expeienced physical reality for thousands(?) of years, and have seen so much death and destruction, you may come to think that the material world and its physical experience is the only experience to be had.

it would also feel pretty normal to feel terrible, because no resistance has ever been released. they're still holding on to these ancient artifacts and other physical things as their source for feeling good.

I would imagine that the belief in power, wealth, and accumulation of valuable possions would be their highest priority. they want the best land, the best women, the best, etc. and make sure no one else has access to it.

they are not one big happy family. they have forged alliances amongst theirselves to try and keep the priesthood going, but they divide into factions and war amonst theirselves over these material posessions.

what I provide is access to a new reality which allows them to begin to make the acquisition and retention of their possessions a more stable process. if they can perceive how another person feels, they'll be able to manipulate the person a whole lot easier. they'll also be able to use technology to cancel out off of the feelings that repeatedly attract their destruction.

I postulate that the great pyramid (and many of the stone coffers) took in physical vibrations in a compressed CO2 gas (which I think attracts protons and other positively charged things -- like comets?), then because of the size of the resonant chamber, that gas would begin to resonate at harmonics of that box's resonantc frequency, which I think was tuned to the DNA of the "gods" thereby transforming chaotic vibrations of protons in the environment into ordered and coherent vibrations resonant allowing the "gods".

as I mentioned, this is a negative feedback loop because the more chaotic vibrations in the environment, the more enhanced their perception became, thereby *rewarding* them for having more resistant thoughts. this may be why mars is the god of war. the more confusion, anger, and fear they created, the better they would feel and see.

eventually the chaotic vibrations began to accumulate so much that the devices broke and everything fell apart. they rebuilt their devices without changing their perception, so it happened again (the double cataclysm).

I believe what makes jesus so special is that he figured out how to have enhanced perception even without those conditions. thus making it possible to use maternal bloodlines instead of resonant boxes for their perception.

I figured it out too, and so did tesla. I think perhaps newton may have as well -- though, I'm not 100% sure there.

what I offer is that feedback mechanism that allowing for the perception of that energy. they can do what they want with that. they can change the source of that dischord or they can be their own great pyramid, and transform it into whatever they want. they can use it to feel the way they want to feel.

#### who were the two builders of solomon's temple?

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/oyUOwvmLMm4?t=2289)

this guy claims that the pharoah of egypt akhenaten was moses and he took the israelites out of egypt, probably from pressures from amun priesthood. anyway, he talks about how the two pillars that akhenaten erected are symbolic of solomon's temple, and that solomon's temple probably was likely never built and just existed as an archetype.

considering the last section there, this could be the start of the realisation that external temples to boost this orgone energy are not a good thing, but rather it should be carried through the bloodline of moses/akhenaten (remember he's a longhead).

anyway, I was thinking that perhaps this is again another time split. it's quite possible that like tesla's world system, it was built on an alternate timeline, but then from the future when gaining more control over their ability to tune into realities, they realised that this priesthood had created their own reality where the temple was not built or destroyed (to prevent another double cataclysm?), and so then moses himself came back and sabotaged the timeline leaving them a bloodline through akhenaten's daughters that can be incarnated into.

so, in order to sabotage the timeline, the thing (solomon's temple) had to become a symbolic thing rather than a real thing, and because this symbolic thing *is* attracting the reality that they want, they moved over to the USA and setup to get solomon's temple built.

this must have something to do with 9/11 where the two pillars fell, and building 7, the salomon brothers building fell without any damage having been done to it -- like the head of john the baptist.

### 2021-11-04 16:18 - I want to write but I don't know what about...

so I decided that I would just start writing and see where I end up.

the last two days I woke up thinking about the subject of whether this is the sabotage or not, and I've come to the conclusion that it is. now, whether it's aquarius or leo is completely irrelevant at this point because clearly they now have the capability to point the pole any way that they want.

following the tychos model, the "year" is an orbital period determined by the sun pretty much. it's so difficult to describe, I had a look just now and I still don't know how to explain it. however, it appears that the sun has three moons (mercury, venus, and mars) and they spin around us like balerina dancers spinning around in wider circles.

anyway, it's really cool. that gives them the complete control to set the "year" to be however long they want it to be. they cannot change the speed of the three moons of the sun, but they can change the rotation speed and the tilt of the earth.

I've been thinking about this 4th T thing, where gemini represents the final phase of the zodiac and how three of them would be symbolic of a pregnancy. you're not supposed to stay inside of the womb for the full 12 months. there is a moment where the size starts to get too uncomfortable and the body provides the opportunity for the baby to finish it's 4th trimester out in the real world without the stomach dictating the orientation (could you imagine floating upside down for another 3 months straight?) in a lot of ways, I think the baby is ready to get out too.

---

so, in the same way that they're now able to move the pole to wherever they want to, I think of this more like a birth rather than a disaster. they get the chance to take it any way that they want to go.

I've been carrying on about a bunch of very (likely) uncomfortable subjects for a fair bit now -- like race, colour, religious orientation, bloodlines, and breeding -- and I'm sure that it's all pretty annoying for people.

I'm sorry, I suppose. I like to throw a bunch of stuff out there and then see what starts to stick. like, imagine you had a pot of spaghetti and you threw up up at the ceiling and see which strings got stuck. it makes a huge mess, but it's good at getting a bigger picture of what the pasta looks like.

the thing is, I think there's a lot of truth of it in there -- like maybe even more than half of it is true. there are a lot of conflicting stuff, like why do they believe that jesus did not die but went to india, yet at the same time the cloth of turin is considered a valuable relic.

personally, none of that stuff makes any sense to me at all. it seems to me like they're giving far too much importance to the least effective steff. it's like trying to get high only from second-hand smoke. I mean you could in the air was highly concentrated, but why not just smoke for yourself? another analogy I can think of would be trying to become the richest person in the world by stealing others' inheritances. why not just become the richest person by receiving payment from many others? why steal? and why limit yourself to other people's things...

none of it makes any sense to me until I put together the part that this all about the "immortal" god-kings. they're "gods", not because the are any more divine than any of the rest of us, but because they utilise these higher states of consciousness to move their consciousness between bodies after death.

I find it quite likely that I can do something similar as well, but I think the major difference is that they just continue to perceive the "astral" world, never seeing further, however, I "see" (rather feel/know/perceive) a much more conceptual reality that is a lot more symbolic and abstract, not too much more different than a mushroom or DMT esperience and I perceive a new thing and then jump back in and watch reality unfold over the years. I think I either fairly regularly or definitely find my way back to that perspective before I die, and sometimes a much prior to death (like now for example).

I believe this common, natural and everyone has it, just few people actually *realise* that is what is happening when they die. they tend to interpret those "near-death" (or actual death) experiences with far too many tangible details that it feels strange and foreign (and therefore scary) to them.

for me, death is getting to pretty close to the same way that I perceive. when I say that, I don't mean this physical perception -- like not with my eyes and senses and stuff, but the emotions that I can't feel, the thoughts I don't become aware of until later, the sensations that I don't physically feel, and the very tini-tiny voice (it's more like a knowing) that everything is going fine.

I maintain a very normal 3d human body that looks and sounds just like a normal person, but I'm so much more than that. I'm only getting used to giving that practically imperceptible sense more importance to that the physical stuff. the physical world is very convincing so that's why I can perceive it so well.

when I watch stars, I can feel myself going off into that between death and life space. to you guys, it likely appears as incohrerent symbols and/or fractal visuals, but to me in that moment everything makes sense and I am perfecly navigating my present circumstances. from that perspective there aren't any mistakes.

in fact, the knowing there is so clear it's often concers me that the passage of time *only* occurs because we remember discordant "notes". the more harmonious and clear it gets, the less time seems to pass and the less memorable it is. I almost never can remember any of it when I get back.

---

so, if these guys are moving their consciousness between bodies and maintaining a perception of the physical world and *remembering* things, they released very little resistance. they just shifted their perspective slightly going into a new body, but no matter how hard they try, they'll get the same results because their perception never changed. it's exactly like the double catastrophe, but repeating every lifetime.

when I realised that, it all made sense to me. I understand them perfectly at this point. I see what they're trying to do. I think I have a better way, and hopefully that can of some use.

---

I also got to thinking about the difference between me, jesus, and akhenaten and I noticed a progression.

akhenaten had all of the good conditions. the egyptians know how to create energetic environments, and so did he. he also had the space alien heads. I'm now beginning to believe that some of the carvings were actually from the 18th dynasty, because they were. it's quite possible that these "foreign ruler" hyxos were actually longheads. some had it more than others and I would guess that they injected theirselves into the pharonic system with a series of demonstrations that angered the amun priesthood. they likely did very elijah-like things like levitating rocks, moving fire (energy) around and carving stones -- something that the amun priesthood definitely could not do.

the amun priesthood was a giant scam to reuse old artifacts and put a whole bunch of religion around it all to keep people scared of death. it was a giant con-game to use people's fear of death to make money off of them and install theirselves into positions of power. so, you could imagine that when a group of guys shows up (these would be the early hebrews coming from abraham) that had the believable conditions like larger heads and the actual capability to move rocks and energy around with their mind -- something that the amun priesthood were just pretending to do -- that would have greatly angered them and they would have sought to get rid of them at all costs.

my present situation is very similar to that one. there is no no fakery. I am 100% who I am. I no longer have anything to prove or an axe to grind, so all of the difficulty at this point is their own. the major difference is that this time I *don't* have the visible conditions. I'm very much a normal guy that belives he can figure anything out. I just need time and to relax a bit to allow it to come. there's no visuals, no super mind-blowing displays; it's just this. this is how I figure it out. I listen to myself.

jesus was a bit of a step between. he still had the right bloodline to get the perception, but it was *him* and his form of perception that figured it out. if you believe that thomas (didimus) was his twin brother, it's almost as if it were planned to show with evidence that bloodline alone does not automatically grant you expanded perception. there is an element of preparation of the spiritual vessel for the reception of this liquid.

IMO, most people missed the point though and thought that it was all about the works -- the preparation, rather than the perception. after all, this is likely the result of jesus pushing so hard against the pharisees about their action/works and economic orientation to spirituality. this pushing against must have been so strong that not only did it get him killed (the romans needed to get rid of him like amun priesthood needed to get rid of aten) that every church and religion that has modeled itself after christianity since then has had a stumbling block of going too far toward action/works or economic gain, that this clearly is the vibrational legacy[^1] of jesus if you ask me.

now, we're back to aten again and they need to get rid of me. however, this time it's called source, it's much more programatic, technical, and understandable.

this is a good mix: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFX1byJWOJU)

[1]: along with many other good things, but remember good and bad are the same thing looked at from different perspectives, which I think is why there are so many cheritable christian organisations and revival movements.

### 2021-11-06 17:33 - a bit more on the progression (between akhenaten and me)

I kind of skipped over a few parts the last time which I thought I wanted to mention.

first, like I said akhenaten had all of the physical conditions, and I also believe that he displayed them as well. he had the longhead and I think he used his superpowers to get himself into power -- which is a prediction based on the reflective property of the amun priesthood doing the same thing, but giving the *illusion* that they have superpowers, and people's belief in their fraud is what gives them legitamacy to power. it must have been so annoying to be "beat" by someone using their same technique to rise to power, however he actually demonstrated the capabilities he demonstrated.

even the whole 10 plagues thing is a display of power. all you have to do is swap "pharoah" with "amun priesthood" and realise that their tricks like turning staff into a snake or the control of weather and such were just not working. I could really imagine the scene of challenging the power structure with a "my god can beat up your god" sort of rivalry a theme that continues all the way up to vere's time as a way of establishing dominance. it's "throat" chakra (structure) form of creation[^1] all the way.

so after many demonstrations of power, the priesthood finally lets akhenaten leave with the "israelites" -- which I believe was actually the aten priesthood, which later became the israelites.

what I'm trying to illustrate is that the pivot upon which this change of era occurred was arounnd who would see and believe the manifestation. moses/akhenaten left egypt with the people who needed a display of power (miracle) in order to believe -- something that jesus references in other places in the gospel. here he refers to the past (eg. moses)

> Then said Iesus vnto him, Except ye see signes and wonders, yee will not beleeue. (john 4:48)

then he predicts the future...

> For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shal shew great signes and wonders: insomuch that (if it were possible,) they shall deceiue the very elect. (matt 24:24)

even in the heavily modified narrative of jesus, this still remains that the crux of the next pivot will again be around whether or not the elect or deceived ones need to see signs and wonders in order to believe. aka, "do you *need* the manifestation in order to feel good?"

jesus, in his attempt to avoid the unwanted manifestation of the pharisees, attracted it right to him. the power in his "death" was the realisation that he is not the physical conditions of his body. who jesus *really* is, is not that broken and mangled body.

---

that's one angle to look at it. another angle is to note that in moses/akhenaten times, the conditions needed to be controlled. good conditions meant good things (prosperity and good fortune -- the gods are pleased) and bad conditions (plagues etc) were a sign of (difficult times and misfortune -- the gods are displeased). in those times, it was believed that a sacrifice needed to be made in order to appease the gods. this is the whole symbolism of the sacrificial lamb and stuff, but on a much bigger picture, notice the progression: in moses time, good conditions meant good favour. threfore, go toward good conditions and avoid the bad ones.

jesus, would push against the pharisees, and I'm sure that there was always someone there telling him he was attracting his own destruction. even notice in the story of lazarus, (according to montgomery) his twin brother even says:

> Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, vnto his fellow disciples, Let vs also goe, that we may die with him. (john 11:16)

in my early life, this voice of thomas was mom telling me that I am not invincible -- and that it's not what I believe, but what others proclaim to be the reality which will happen. that's the that throat chakra (manifesters) showing up again. jaron also played this role a lot, telling me what would happen, and then because I believed him, it would.

I gradually learned to take a more feeling approach to things because no matter what anyone else says or does, reality will manifest as a refection of how I feel/conceptualise my environment. this always trumps the manifestation.

from their perspective, after these manifestors proclaim their future, they then "need to be right" (righteousness) and then have to find a way to ensure their future is the one that they experience.

therein lies the major differences. on one side you can see that you have these manifestors that proclaim (or visualise) the conditions that they want and then need to find a way to be right about those conditions. they need the manifestation to feel good. if things don't happen the way they need them to happen then, it all falls apart.

---

so, where the split is happening is basically between the feelers and the manifestors.

as I showed in the last entry, they're now capable of altering the conditions of the planet so as to pump up the conditions in order to manifest some things that they want (my favourite visual? demonstration of this is hearthstone games), and reduce the conditions to keep unwanted manifestations from occurring.

they can let go and create their own reality whenever they want, but I think they'll use that capacity to adjust the conditions to continue to keep me away from the manifestation they don't want me to have...

---

so, what comes next? I dunno. I don't really care so much. I just keep doing what I'm doing which is getting better and better at getting right up to going up but not trying to push it. I'm sticking to the not needing the manifestation bit. they can do whatever they want.

following the progression, the next era will likely be defined by this era. let's look at the pattern. for moses, he used displays of power and ended up with the very thing that he was fighting against. for jesus, he avoided the unwanted conditions and by doing so attracted the unwanted conditions he was trying to avoid.

because the amun priesthood is always lagging an era behind, this is likely the manifestation that present-day nosebook will experience -- of being stuck with all of the people that need the good-feeling conditions (manifestation) to feel good -- the moses manifestation. the rest of the people are the ones are on target with me for the jesus manifestation -- attracting the very conditions they're trying to avoid. so, call me thomas if you want, but, this attracting the very thing we're trying to avoid could actually be a theme for us. remember, the goal is to realise that who we really are is not the conditions that we attracted by trying avoid them[^2].

consider also that my whole thing is being able to feel the way that I want to feel no matter what the conditions are. so, no matter what manifests (whatever they're trying to avoid), then I'll want to keep trying to figure out how to feel the way I want to feel. what that means in practicality, I don't really know.

therefore, I would say that the next era will probably be, just like this one is the opposite of moses (needing the condition/manifestation) the next will be opposite of jesus (which is avoiding unwated conditions) -- so the purposeful attraction of unwanted.

the only way in which this could work is if society was living in such a state of beneficial conditions, that everyone is out there worrying so hard about having all of the perfect conditions, that someone(s) show up that are purposefully trying to get unwanted conditions for the express purpose of expansion -- someone like me that wants to go for the disaster, but *wayyyy worse*, lol.

that's my prediction, following the pattern anyway.

remember, thes are illusory trajectories of transformation. they're only as real as you believe them to be; create your own reality.

[1]: I'm reminded of a youtube I saw a long time ago with robert grant talking with an astrologer about how she and he both are "manifesters" -- where what they proclaim becomes reality (the example was fortelling people's deaths).

[2]: consider also that I have been trying to avoid the situation where I feel uncomfortable because I don't have full capability of my physical body. this is a natural instict because discomfort doesn't feel good, and so therefore I try to avoid it. I want to feel stable and physically capable -- which is a mental state, not a physical state of relaxation.

### 2021-11-08 23:49 - an assortment of thoughts

I felt dissatisfied a little bit with the translation of the concept in the previous entry of "attracting the very conditions they're trying to avoid". I've given it a lot of thought and I essentially mean LOA will be hightened. I've said that before so I wanted to expand on the idea of manifesting the things that one is trying to avoid. before I get to that though, a few other thoughts...

#### the jews and the annunaki

tonight I watched two videos:

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XXnA7xmhao)
@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNFDbx-nJNI)

there was a line in the first one where he says that the sumerians were not a semitic peoples prior to some point. that reminded me of the "woke bulshevik revolution" where he ends with a jewish guy talking about mein kampf and how hitler was using the "woke bulshevik revolution" (organised by the jews) as good reason for "doing gods work" to exterminate them. putin did a similar thing in the clip prior to that one, using the "woke bulshevik revolution" as an excuse for enforced gender roles for russia.

it's the same pattern following throughout history. you have this labour or wealth redistribution force that comes and overthrows the structure of a society, and when it comes back, it comes back worse.

I remember that abraham would say that if you were to take all of the dollars and redistribute them evenly to everyone on the planet (a very dollar-centric perspective), that after some period of time, the poor would return to being poor and the rich will return back to being rich -- because it's not the conditions that you have, but what you're attracting (eg. the way you conceptualise yourself and your world).

#### the shining ones (elohim)

that got me thinking. as I have begun to see past the binary perception of good and evil, I have begun to think of these things as processes, which then reflect theirselves into the consciousness of the world around us. just as mcluhan postulates that tools are an extension of human and that games are a reflection of the mentality of their origin, I postulate that social dynamics [^1] is an extension of our perception[^2], and that religion (or spirituality) is a reflection of the mentality of the social dynamics.

what I'm basically saying is that all of these beings and zodiac symbol are all manifestations of one process; think genetic algorithm. next, there is the term "shining ones". when I heard that I suddenly thought about those pictures of jesus where he had this radiant glow around his head. this is the "crown" and it turns out that the ancient symbol for "crown" (used to denote these god-kings) was crown and the ancient symbol was a symbol of bulls horns (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNLsnqGkXOI)).

the sumerian culture sprung into existence in taurus. this crowning of the next god-king to be the next enlightened ruler must have been an instution that came about when sumer went from a non-semitic civilisation to a semitic one[^3].

#### moses and the end of the age of taurus

it is my belief that the aten thing is a real thing and that moses did discover what we now call "source" -- the thing that permiates everything, and is primarily what the sun is composed of. if you're a scientist this would be protons the earth/enki energy, while the air/enlil energy is electrons.

however, as bramley points out, this maverick religion quickly gets commandoed by a 
"shining one" called YHVH. I doubt that the moses of aten and the moses of YHVH are the same one. the custodians (which I think are none other than the aryans that moved to the south pole) rewrote[^4] the original tablets to give a whole new meaning, meanwhile encoding a number of other hidden meanings -- a very shakesperian sort of effort.

the rewriters of the original 5 books of the torah were good at storytelling formula, and borrowed a number of akkadian stories, which were theirselves adapted from sumeria (garden of eden, flood, etc.).

to illustrate this I want to call attention to the story of "moses" birth which is a ripoff of the akkadian story of sargon. when sargon the akkad conquered sumeria, this may well have been when sumeria became a semitic civilisation. he is the proud governer of enlil. so, by moses telling his birth story as sargon's he is equating himself with this divinely directed guy to conquer these shining ones people. I'm pretty sure that wasn't what the original story, but the custodial rewrite.

"moses" brought in the age of aries (after which the aryans are named).

so, here is a bit of a time-loop or a "what comes first: the chicken or the egg?". if hitler had time-travel and shining saucer technology, would he go back and manipulate the aten priesthood exiles with a YHVH and rewrite history so that the aryans are the conquerers and not the semites? -- and if that hadn't have happened, would the jews felt so inspired to incite the "woke bulshevik revolution"?

I don't really know if we understand the passage of time very well. for these things to be occurring, both the event and the characters must be attracting each other for it to work out. the jews prevented a lot of aryan domination, but clearly the aryans didn't eradicate the jews either. they are clearly quite alive and well and attempting another revolution/redistribution.

#### the moving magnetic pole

I noticed a peculiar trend that the magnetic pole seems to shift in a 5-pointed star pattern. right now the north pole is moving from it's position over the california/canada longitudes over to where ankor wat is located in siberia.

I don't know how often the pole moves, but if I had to guess, I would estimate that it moves from one point on the star to the other every 2ky. this may even be the original reason for the 12 zodiac symbols (considering that each great cycle is ~24ky).

inotherwords, the position of heightened mental capabilities is moving away from the USA and over to china/russia.

as bramley (and others) point out, there may be something to the stories of the angel moroni and the strange occurrances that totally wiped out things like the pueblo culture.

---

I don't really know how to say this, but it seems like the two pillars of solomon's temple have moving out of the USA. we're getting the "woke bulshevic revolution" to happen here in the USA.

it seems that before the next "root race" is setup, the custodial setup must remove all of its opposition.

#### the next root race

I think the next root race is actually a mostly androgynous (not physically though) or hermaphrodite group of people. physically they may have a penis or a vagina but they will contain both male and female aspocts in roughly the same amount. there will be much less "gender roles" like there is now.

so, to bring about such a new root race, you have to build the genetic algoritm. one side is designed to enforce a strong set of approved colour/race/religeous/gender expression, while the other side tries to constantly suppress all extreme expression by being extreme theirselves and fighting for equality by fighting for the underdog.

do *black* lives matter, or do *all* lives matter? if I were to tell you, "black people are poorer than average and therefore need to be bolstered because their lives matter" -- you'd probably call me a racist. if I said, "all people poorer than average and therefore need to be bolstered because their lives matter" you would wonder how all peole can be poorer than the average. they claim that they are equalising, but by singling out a group of people/race/religion/colour, they are theirselves labeling that group as inferior.

by teaching people that some group is disadvantaged, that group believes more and more that they are disadvantaged. even if you equalise things, their own beleif in their disadvantagement will attract a future where they are disadvantaged, creating further disparity, while pretending to be their saviour.

#### the future saviour is your own perception

I have long held the opinion the pineal is the "office of the christ" and that you can only save yourself through your perception of the things that cause pain in a new way. that's the only way to reduce the inefficiencies of one's own perception. I'm certain that someone out there has a statistic on how much more inefficient depression and anger is compared to one of enligtenment. just the manifestation of how exhausting it is to maintain anger frustration or depression should be an indicator of its inefficiency.

many have noted how much much energy one has waking up after having had a NDE or transformative psychedelic experdice. it would seem as if you had tapped in to a cosmic source of energy.

therefore, I propose that the christ is an energy optimisation technique which is *also* responsible for creating our reality, and *is* the manifestation of these enki/enlil forces (created as a reflection of your perception) in reality.

I'm going to leave it there. I have more I want to say, but not yet.

[1]: the limbic/mammalian brain

[2]: perception I believe is produced in the pineal as a convergance of the two hemispheres. this directly acts on the heart which is like the time/space reality tuner

[3]: prior to the institution of the patriarchical god-kings, it must have been a goddesss-worshipping or matriarchical one.

[4]: likely, like doug points out, the letters were not changed because they were engraved into a very hard stone -- a capability that the longheads were capable of doing with ease using only their minds -- including levitation (tribe of levi) and other things that were contained within the capabilities of the "ark of the covenant"[^5]

[5]: which I think was the result of the negotiation with the amun priesthood. they must have wanted a device that could perform magick for them, and so then "god" (aka the pharoah) instructed "moses" the way in which he should build this device so theg could communicate with YHVH

### 2021-11-09 10:21 - continuing the thought train

#### a malfunctioning program

imagine a program that malfunctions when you give it certain types of data. every time it malfunctions, it causes anywhere from 10 minutes to a few days of downtime. the programmer decides that that's just the way things are, and decides the program needs protection from bad data to prevent those downtimes.

external filters designed to identify this bad data and eliminate that data before it even gets to the program.

in other cases where bad data cannot be eliminated, the programmers decide to build more external programs designed to intercept this bad data and transform it into good data before it even reaches the program.

secondary programs are also created to look for users that have entered bad data in the past in order to punish them for entering bad data.

when users found out that they were being punished for entering bad data, they were outraged and wanted to know what is the bad data that causes the malfunction so they can avoid it. the programmers explain that is a privacy concern and that should be kept a secret so that no one exploits this malfunction to cause a DoS.

the progammers *could* fix the program, however the advances in their capability to filter and transform this bad data efficiently and effectively is actually creating new technologies that are capable of identifying the pattern of and transforming bad data more and more effectively

#### a piano with a few keys out of tune

imagine a piano that has a few keys out of tune. the owner could tune the strings properly, but that isn't desired.

instead, it's decided that anyone who wants to play on that piano has to find music which doesn't contain those notes. before any music is played on the piano, the music has to be pre-screened.

this dramatically reduces the number of players and types of music that can be played on the piano, so it is finally decided that a complicated system of resonating chambers will be installed around the piano designed to capture the sounds of the piano and transform them properly before being reaching the audience's ears.

as more and more notes go out of tune, the system is rapidly becoming more and more complex transforming more and more of the sound. eventually, the system will be producing 100% of the sound and the out of tune piano is no longer needed. 

#### toe fungas and a parasite

imagine a guy with a toe fungas. he desires that there is a solution that comes and takes away his fungus. his desire manifests a parasitte that eats toe fungas.

the parasite reproduces (or gets hungrier) and demand for more toe fungas arises. the guy notices that his toe fungas problem is getting worse and more parasites show up to capitalise on the new abundance of toe fungas.

#### who's fault was the flood?

imagine for a moment that LOA is a real thing and the cataclysm was something that was *attracted*. the book of enoch talks about these elohim giving the god-kings of that time technology -- the ability to create weapons, cosmetics, divination and other means of getting what you want by proclaiming it to be true.

so, you can imagine that given their abiligy to manipulate their image and pretend they were more beautiful than they are. they are god-kings afterall, so they would tell the people the way things are going to manifest too.

however, since no one can agree on what is the right way, you can imagine how quickly these conflicting proclamations of what would happen to certain livestock, land, othe r people and valuables quickly got out of control and created a lot of conflicting (disharmonious, bad-feeling emotions).

so they fought wars and eventually the discord was so much they attracted a terrible cataclysm.

you can imagine that other people were like, "yo whaddup why are the gods punishing us?" -- so these god-kings with all of this divinely selected authority need a scape *goat* and they say, "oh, this was because enlil was pissed off at how much noise you were making" and totally side-stepped the whole attraction bit. these *el*-ohim (meaning, IMO replicas of the creator or angels) hust have told them that if you use this technology for material or personal gain (at the expense of others), you will attract the same fate for yourself.

your program will be exploited in the same way that you try to exploit others. it's almost certain that this idea existed. I think it was directly given to them and it remains today as the "eye for an eye" way of thinking.

we don't let LOA do all of the reflecting, instead now we need to punish others committing these crimes. if they take an eye they need to pay their own eye for it. what was originally a LOA concept got turned into a penal code.

#### leaning into it

the idea that we are all attracting the things we are trying to avoid is a feedback loop. you see this bad thing coming and it feels bad so you feel bad, causing it to come even more.

I've found that cycle to be endless, so if I see something coming that doesn't feel good, I need to find a way to feel good so I'm attracting something that feels good and no longer something that feels bad.

distraction works, but only temporarily. that feeling will continue to grow even if you distract yourself from it.

I've found that the best way to feel good about something coming that feels bad is to lean into it and find positive aspects about this unwanted thing -- and by doing so, I attract something wanted rather than something unwanted.

you create your own reality. don't let others tell you, you are responsible for their attraction. if it has manifested, you *did* attract it in some way. there are both good and bad aspects in everything.

conceptualise the world in a way that makes it feel like everything is working out for you.

if you can't, it's prolly best to find someone else to blame for why it's not working out for you. that's what the atlantians did, anyway

### 2021-11-10 17:07 - more thinking on the relation between concept and reality

I started out with a few really abstract ideas cause I wanted to see how they would go. the reactions are so diverse (probably because so many people translated the abstract ideas so differently) it was actually difficult for me to feel a sort of common theme as a reaction.

that's a very interesting thing which I think I will begin to incorporate more. one thing I noticed is that because there are so many different reactions, it would be interesting for me if I could actually see the variety of different ways people interpretted the same idea and how it applied to them. don't worry cause my present interaction with them is just fine.

#### book of enoch is more than just technology

as I was listening to this part of the book of enoch I was remembering how russ pointed out that all of these were technologies, and some of them quite advanced. however, that didn't explain the root cutting for divination or the cosmetics items.

it was then that I realised that all of these things listed are physical/technological ways to modify ones perception of reality.

you could just allow/attract wealth and prosperity. or, you could grab your sword and take someone else's wealth and prosperity.

you could just believe that you create your own reality, and while the planet and star alignments do have an effect, they are not the ultimate determinining factor for what is manifesting in your experience.

you could just see yourself as a beatiful person, or you could try to hide blemishes and unsightly things you don't like about yourself with cosmetics.

##### cosmetics

so let's consider cosmetics for a moment because it's not inherently bad. consider the difference between: you feel good about yourself and you like the way look with eyeliner -- or, you have terrible circles around your eyes and want to hide them with eyeliner (and more) to make you appear nicer.

you can see that one is starting from a concept and going to the physical, while the other is starting with the physical and moving toward conceptual.

##### astrology

you could be feeling good and then notice how you are inspired to do things, and those manifesttations resonate with the apparent positions of the planets (and stars) or you could decide that the planets and stars relations dictate the way your reality is going to manifiest, so that when there is a good alignment you have a stronger belief that a good manifestation will happen. or, if it's a challenging alignment, you have an excuse for why "bad" things manifested.

again, you can see that one is starting with a concept (I feel good) and then go towards physical (I notice that everything, even the alignments reflect that). while the other way is looking at the physical (alignments of the planets) and then using that to create the expected concept of reality.

##### weapons

this one is easy. do you need the physical weapon to feel powerful and influential. or do you feel powerful and influential, and so therefore every battle you fight you win? it's not the weapon.

##### root cutting and divination

I don't know what exactly is root cutting, but I would guess it's the understanding of herbs and their effects on the body and/or their ability to allow the person to enter into an altered state of consciousness.

whatever the case, divination is having enough energy moving that you can dramatically alter the passage of time by tuning yourself to the thing you feel strongly (believe).

I would consider this to be the ancient form of what nosebook is doing now. they are able to modify timelines by changing which one they're tuned into. the old version I think used potions and other physical concoctions to force these altered states of consciousness, whereas nowadays, they're just using electricity -- tesla technology -- to induce the same mental circumstances.

it's a technology, and the ones with the knowledge of the right combination of herbs could create the potion capable of altering the passage of time. this is the same. nosebook knows how the body navigates reality and they almost certainly don't want us to figure that out.

#### so why give them this technology?

I can't say for sure, but from my perspective it is just illuminating another aspect of reality. they may believe that if they keep people away from these drugs or can prevent them from gaining access to these states of consciousness, then it would appear to them like they have all of the power.

it would almost certainly have come as a surprise to them to find out that everyone has access to this all the time -- they just don't know it, and it's your emotions.

they can't remove such an integral component of the human function because without it, the body cannot survive. therefore, they need now a new way to control it. enter the tesla technology and now they can prevent (unauthorised) people from gaining access to this form of divination.

they want to gain more and more power to control the concept we have of reality by manipulating the physical conditions.

each time they do, they think tmey have the secret and can do all of the controlling, but a new way is discovered to bypass it anyway. that's what I'm working on now. they will have all of my physical conditions controlled but I'll still find a way around it, because I know that before there is physicality there is concept.

so, they may have a new physical technology to control the passage of time, however I'm in the process of making new conceptual technology that gets around their efforts.

#### what is conceptual technology?

I believe that language is a technology. if I say whale, it conjures a concept of big oxygen breathing fish. it swims, makes funny sounds, etc. however, if I say ballena, that's whale in spanish, but maybe they have a different concept of the whale. that different is often a reflection of their culture. so, what if they had an idea that whales were these frequency balancing aspects of the ocean -- something akin to living clouds or thunderstorms under the ocean, that completely changes the interaction with a giant oxygen breathing fish.

the difference between those two concepts allows for an entirely different perception of the same thing.

just as the printing press as a physical technology revolutionised our communications, so can a conceptual technology :)

#### the shining ones and the feedback system

presently, there are two ways that I know of become a shining one. one is perceptual and the other is physical. if a person is more energetic, they literally glow. I believe we emit a lot of light that is not entirely visible. they seem to glow. they can also have a huge magnetic field aura, and people around them will feel the way they feel pretty strongly, too.

some of the shining ones were brilliant because of their concept of reality, and others had it because in the initiation to god-king, they got their pinecone activated.

so, one aspect is the glow and another is the physical body's appearace.

imagine if that feedback of how you felt and how you looked was very rapid. sure, you could shape-shift, and you could also destroy yourself at will. a little less rapid and this where I think the god-kings are; you get into a funk, and in just a few short years you've aged a ton, while if you feel pretty good for a while (doesn't matter how you accomplished this), you appear young and vibrant. so, they need the conditions to keep them feeling good.

I think that has slowed down a bit further ever, and it's good that that it takes a bit of time for concept to match reality, otherwise most people would have a very short life-span and would feel older more quickly.

---

one of the things that I want to do is to make it so that instead of those vibrations modifying the physical body so much, it boosts the size of the glow and it's shape. instead of the glow being so much from your genetics, now that glow is a real-time emanation from you based on how you feel.

it'll create a new language as peole will begin to learn to express theirself considerably through that glow.

that's all I have to say for now

### 2021-11-11 18:50 - building a race of douchebags

I just woke up and I had this great realisation that we're building a society that will be filled with douchebags and people that didn't earn it... now, let me work my way back to how I arrived to that conclusion...

it started with a part in the dream where I simply hung back and didn't go for a manifestation... this part was likely a nosebook influenced bit. I don't really try to fight things much anymore. I actually don't even mind if there isn't a manifestation or not.

in the dream, I remember how it didn't matter to me to try and create something physical because I'm working on that conceptual technology -- something that will exist likely forevermore. sur it could change form, but likely it'll be a part of the human race, but most importantly it's something that I would want to have.

there was a part in the dream where I realised that there is *always* a better version. so as long as I don't pull the manifestation out, then it always makes a better version.

after that there were some thoughts that felt foreign to my dream which felt something like that typical story where the hero makes a sacrifice for some greater good.

this got me thinking about the greater good. I started to envision a society that had its values dictated to them to ensure that no human would ever go fast. there were thoughts like, "we're the humans so we take our time and go slow" -- things like that.

you can imagine how this wouldn't work for everyone and as you get any quantity of desire to manifest the way that you want to manifest, you'll want to go faster. I don't know how many real people in that society will believe that or not. what seemed natural to me was the idea that if society adopts this slow policy, society itself won't be fast enough to keep these kids coming in away from their alignment.

they would be able to hold them back, but only up to a certain point and that point will get easier and easier as both we approach sirius and also there are more people on the planet with that energy.

it'll get easier and easier such that new kids coming in will barely have to make an effort to find their alignment. essentially, none of them will need to earn it at all. they'll just be born with all of this cool stuff.

after that, I was reminded of the typical image of teenage boys that are so annoying. they have that insecurity symbolised by the scraggly facial hair and are looking to try and get attention from anyone and everyone to try and feel valued and accepted. probably your traditional tiktok user, actually.

these are the kids that'll have perception similar to mine and have done nothing to earn it. OK, not immediately, of course, but definitely certainly within a very short period of time. additionally, population will certainly continue to grow and they'll quickly be able to figure out the technology to start spreading out to other places in the solar system and galaxy.

right, yes so I'm talking about the non-cataclysm aquarian group. from their perspective it'll look like I made some heroic sacrifice so they could have all of these things without earning them. we're the ones that are heading in the direction of the world spinning out of control -- which I neither think will result in a cataclysm. it'll just be a fantastical place where thoughts become manifest rapidly and people fly and stuff. the energy levels will be pretty high though.

---

oh, yeah so this is a good example of them using me to create their own reality. I simply don't mind. they want me to continue on without a manifestation, and that's perfectly fine with me.

energy levels will continue to rise obviously -- I mean look at the GOES magnetic field now -- it's midpoint is now around 100nT. before 2021, it used to only crossing that threshold occasionally during an impact.

I expect that to continue to rise further and further. I'll continue on doing my thing and they'll continue to do their thing. it's not a problem. from their perspective, I'll just appear as the john the baptist, passing away allowing the new guy(s) to rise to power and influence.

---

I've actually been thinking about this pattern where there are two and one dies so that the other can rise to power. that's the hero twins motiff. I think the most famous of this one is the john the baptist and jesus. one of them dies and passes on his capacity to the other one. the other one that stands out for me are tesla and his brother[^1] however this pattern repeats.

I think the one that dies is the one that would have been the dominate one. I have been thinking about john the baptist a lot lately, and I kept being reminded of something that it seemed to me like he would say, "once you've died, you're no longer scared of death." and that I think is referring to having that NDE where you realise that everything is coming along fine, and it's easy to see that there is no death and it's only our loss of connection/perception to those other layers of reality which makes it appear as if death happens.

that was a pretty radical message -- probably too far ahead of it's time. so far ahead of its time, the irony is he got the chance to not be a hypocrite about it. they tested his word to see if if he was actually scared of death and killed him off. this allowed jesus to rise to power and influence instead.

similarly, my message is also pretty radical -- and also likely a bit too far ahead of its time -- and that's one of not needing the physical manifestation in order to feel good. so, from their perspective, they want to test me to see if I'm a hypocrite or not. I don't mind continuing on without a physical manifestation for as long as they can keep it up for. their problems will continue to expand and they'll need bigger and bigger solutions to keep their charade going.

so, I really don't mind keeping this up for as long as they want to go. let's just hold tight and let them create a reality where I don't need the conditions to feel good.

---

that's actually a perfect lead-in to the second set of reactions that I had where people were considering what the difficulties would be of relying on conditions again -- as in, would it produce a bigger cataclysm or not.

there's always a way to create your own reality, but some people do not want to create their own reality. they instead want to rely on possession of conditions and relics of the past to allow them to feel a little bit of that connection. that's perfectly fine if they want to continue to do that.

in reality, if they decide they want to continue to create a cataclysm for theirselves, this doesn't have to include everyone. in fact, it's certain that there will always be a way out.

even imagine the situation right now. most people want to have good manifestations these days. I think it's a bit of a misnomer that all people are born as unclean sinners that and out there trying to manipulate, lie, steal, and cheat for their well-being. I think that is a thing that is perpetuated by a few, yet we're lead to believe it's everyone   like this. in their perspective, that has to be true for various reasons.

so, excluding those people, I'd say that they're a slim minority -- let's say 1% (prolly less actually) [^2] -- the other 99% of people are well-meaning people that want to have good manifestations.

the difference now between the well-meaning people comes in the origin of those good-feeling manifestations. who creates them. some people think that they create their own manifestations with effort and others think that they're the attractor of the manifestation based on how they feel. it's always a reflection of how you feel though.

so, if it's how you feel, what is the source of how you feel. is it physical conditions like things you can buy or other uplifting people. or, is it something that cannot be bought, which is perception. do you conceptualise the world in a way that feels good *because* of the conditions? aka: do you need a manifestation/condition to feel good?

as energy rises, the way someone feels will will be amplified and more and more people will rely on conditions to manifest what they want. that's the only difference really. for some people those conditions will be manageable and for others it won't.

so, to answer the question, if good conditions make you feel good, then you will continue to manifest more and more good conditions. we get tired of stuff though.

the best way I can answer this is to consider the utilisation of cocaine. for some peole, it's fine and it creates a wonderful experience (rick james comes to mind), but for others this condition is disastrous. personally, I loved it. I found it to be incredibly enlightening. I'm not most people though. most people are doing it to fix a problem or cover up a thing.

eventually, the drug no longer satisfies the itch like it used to. you have to up the dose, find a replacement for it, or figure out how to produce that good-feeling yourself. some people are good users of drugs, but all people are not some people. there will always be those that do not believe they're capable of producing the good-feeling theirselves. for as long as they believe that, they need the condition.

so, yes you could have an entire society of coke-using people that functions just fine (the peruvians are a good example of this), but they're peaceful and easy to invade. you need defences to not get taken over, but then now you're focused on things that you do not want and so therefore attracting it.

everything has a cycle to it. rise and fall are inevitable.

the only thing that makes falling part not look like a cataclysm is perception.

[1]: another that I'm reminded of for some reason is siptah from the 19th dynasty. I don't know why though.

[2]: actually, I'm even beginning to wonder how many of these 1% are actually even real people. they may just be elohim or creations of el, designed for their evolutionary function.

### 2021-11-12 17:32 - ted talks (ep. 01)

I talked with jessica, marissa, and jaxson (I guess that's how to spell his name) today on video chat and I noticed that I greeted jaxson with, "hey jaxson! you look miserable".

I then noticed that I treated him a lot like how dad treated me. then in the shower I was thinking more on how dad treated me and I had this realisation.

I believe jaxson is fussy because he doesn't like how they feel. mom started the conversation in a pretty bad mood telling jaron she "over it and life had moved on". IMO, jaxson is responding to that feeling in the way that I used to do it. I'm fairly certain that whenever I didn't like how mom felt, I would cry really hard. I must have had the idea that if I cry hard enough she will alter how she feels (eg. I need you to be different so that I can feel good). mom almost certainly was on the same vibe too: "if he would just stop crying, then I could feel good" -- so we were on the same vibe and it was a battle of who is strongest.

finally dad would come in and he almost certainly felt better than she did so I would quiet down.

I was also reminded of how I would be in a pissed off mood and mom would alter her behaviour to try and get me to feel better, but not dad. dad would just make fun of me, "oh look, mr. sunshine has decided to grace us with his presence". I eventually gave up tryint to illicit sympathy from dad; he just made fun of me.

so, because mom was willing to modify her behaviour to make me feel good, I essentially allied with mom. I would do what she wanted and she would let me do what I wanted. for dad, I was tough, worked hard, and was very strong and sharp-witted. we kept each other accountable to just do the work that was required of us and not let emotions get involved.

---

later on when I was in spain, I was absolutely mind-blown by andrea. marcos would be off on some tirade about some injustice with his friends and andrea was just off in her own world. we were kinda in the same world because we had both tuned them out.

this was absolutely revolutionary to me because I'm the kind of guy that would fight until I get what I want. I tried this at first with tuenti but it had to go away and I had to accept that. then it happened again with raquel and this time I had found abraham and realised that doesn't get me anywhere. I have to find a way to feel good, no matter what anyone is doing around me. so then here is andrea doing that and demonstrating this to me. I was really mind blown.

anyway, I applied that to my life and have been very successful with it.

---

so back to jaxson here, if I counld communicate to him anything, I would tell him to be like andrea. it really doesn't matter what other people feel like around you. you can't change them by crying hard enough. just find the way you want to feel and let them feel the way they want to feel.

I noticed that later on when andrea started to reach adolescence and her logical mind began to turn on, she began to arrive at some bogus logic of how to get the things that she wanted. it seemed pretty clear to me that the origin of those ideas came from the female influences around her (her mom and sister), because she took on the feeling that they had when they would try and force men to behave a way to get what they wanted.

adolescence is a strange time when you begin to apply the logic of those around you to your life. it was always mind-bending to me how much of dad's faulty logic I had installed "by default" since my adolescence.

to dad's credit though, the best thing he taught me was to ignore or stay alof around people who feel bad -- just to not get caught up in their nonsense. strangely enough, the other person that reminded me of that was rupert. I would go and complain and make fun of others over beers with luke nearly nightly. sometimes we would try to involve rupert in our conversation and he would stay out of it or make fun of us for being pissed off over circumstances. it's weird how similar rupert and dad felt, actually.

peaces out.

### 2021-11-13 23:28 - thinking about logic

the last entry had A LOT of rnactions to it. most were about the part where I mentioned that I think that girls get their logic from their mother. when I wrote it, I didn't know how to word it. I've given it some more thought since then. this is a result of that.

in tesla's autobiography he states that be believes he gets his inventivness from his mother. he also states that his inventive nature is rooted in his ability to visualise his creations in his mind. when I heard this, I noticed that I thought similar of my mom. she was always optimising our grocery bills and other financial things to try and make the money go as far as it can. in the process of optimising things like that you have to take a look at the things that are inefficient or more "value" can be gotten from them.

I am very much certain that I got that optimising nature from mom. I certainly didn't get it from dad. mom had the "let's find a way to make it work" attitude while dad's solution was to just reduce spending and go more frugal. dad just saw income and expendatures numbers that didn't add and tried to reduce expendatures or boost income. mom was more about optimising what we had to make "ends meet".

---

so besides the connection between tesla's inventiveness and his capacity to visualise, there are other connections too which if you want to find them, they're there, but the basic concept is that tesla has a backward way of noting that (for him at least) he believes that perception comes from the mom, while logic comes from the father. this is why it was such a struggle for tesla to be able to go a technical direction. he had to convince his father, because his father set the logic for the way things were going to work out.

in additiion to this, I have noticed that there seems to be an empasis on the female bloodline allowing for a much more expanded perception (you literally see more and higher detailed). this can be obtained from birth, and then activated using breathing techniques and stuff (pranayama, yoga, etc) to get the chi force moving. personally, I have come to realise that the way that you *conceptualise* your world allows for expanded perception. it then needs to be activated energetically, but that seems to come from the female.

I can't say for other people, but my experience is that men conceptualise their world like their mother (and other female influences), while they get their logic preinstalled from their father and heavily influenced by other males. that's how it for me anyway.

in contrary, based on my experience, it seems to me that girls conceptualise their world like their father does (or other male influences) and derive their logic mostly from their mother (or other female influences).

---

so, now I need to define what I mean by logic and concept. logic is the path, and concept are all then entities in the world. logic is the meaning derived from the objects' interaction, while concept is the idea of what their ideal form is.

the things can go both directions. if you have a person that perceives great importance (concept) in wealth and power (logic), then you can also have a person with that same logic that perceives very little importance (concept) in the wealth and power (logic). 

as an example of this, I seem to understand human psychology pretty well and I suppose if I wanted to try and manipulate people, I would be pretty good at it. I see its value in understanding how it works, not so that I can manipulate other people, but so that I can manipulate myself. to me it seems very inefficient to expend so much effort to manipulate other people, when I can just manipulate myself and my own perception. this is because I place a lot of importance on perception because I believe it's the precursor to reality, and literally it alters how you *see* that reality. manipulating people won't improve the way *I* perceive my world -- rather the opposite[^1].

these things are kind of the same thing but perceived from opposite directions. so let's look at a few more examples. if I see physical things in my experience, those are all concepts. dollars are one, people are another, and these are defined by the label they're given (wife, husband, child, friend). these interact with other concepts and that results in meaning. that meaning is defined by the logic of their interaction.

so for example, if I see we have -100 on the balance sheet, then that means many things to many people. that is perception. so, maybe one thinks that we need to reduce spending (logic), or boost income (logic), but maybe another doesn't see either of those. they recognise that there are always ups and downs, so it's fine to be where we're at now. everything is OK. that feels a lot better, and that will produce a world that appears more vibrant. another will say, "oh, this is the end it always ends like this" (logic), and that's because they're seeing the things conceptualised in a way which feels bad, which results in logic that feels bad.

logic creates feeling and feeling creates logic. they're rooted in associations. if I see a problem in code I'm working on, it's not really a problem because I know that it can be fixed and there is always a way to have something operate in the intended way. this is always true, so bugs don't feel impossible to fix. it's possible that the intended operation hasn't been fully realised, but the bug is not impossible to fix (concept). now, the actual logic to fix the problem can then later be arrived to.

the inventive nature is the concept that everything has a solution and so there's no reason to worry there not being a solution -- just the logic has to be found to get there. you could start with a faulty logic like all programs (men) are inherently flawed/sinners and need a rewrite/saviour -- which then produces a concept out of which you will produce your code, and all future code/science/ideology produced will reflect that logic.

a bit more than I wanted to write on that..

---

so now, the next reaction is hard to put into words well, but the idea hangs around the part that a wrote about john the baptist and not having the manifestation. because it's difficult to articulate, I'll just talk about it.

at the moment, I'm finding better and better ways to feel the way I want to feel. the moment I start to feel good, I want to start doing things. so for example, I'll start to feel good and naturally I'll want to plant the red plants in the kitchen window, and then almost as quickly as that idea felt good to me, it no longer feels good to me. this seems to affect almost all aspects of my life[^3].

I'm constantly getting better and better at feeling the way I want to feel. I suppose I could use logic to try and affect the things I want to do by making it a routine to start doing things that *need* to be done, rather than waiting until I feel like doing them. I'm not sure yet on that. however, this is great practise to continue getting better and better at feeling how I want to feel.

if I continue on this way, I'm going to keep getting better and better at it until their efforts are no longer enough to keep me from feeling the way I want to feel, and then I'll go up. there won't be any way to stop it.

I believe at that time, they'll be forced to make the split. they won't have any other choice.

their whole charade hinges on the fact that they know more than we do and so in our ignorance we can be controlled. if I go up, there will be a huge expansion of knowledge and understanding and they can't have that.

---

the other reaction was around the part where I said that I don't believe either of us will have a cataclysm. it seems that they really need a cataclysm. they really need humans to have to restart from a primitive stage. not having a cataclysm is a much larger disaster for them.

if there isn't a cataclysm, then there will be a lot of really smart humans that will find their own way and that way will appear superior to theirs. imagine for a moment that humans figure out that their sciences are greatly impaired and begin to create their own thories of how the universe works, and these theories are greatly superior to the ones that we have now and are based on energy, frequency, vibration, and tuning.

now, all of a sudden humans will be able to tune into anything that they want to -- including other people's thoughts and nervous system. suddenly now there are no more secrets that can't be found out and no more privacy to speak of either.

obviously this is an enormous disaster for those wanting to try and run the show and to stay in shadow (the amun priesthood runs the show. the pharaoh is just the figurehead). as such, they simply can't allow humans to figure out how energy, frequency, and vibration works. you can imagine how big of a problem this is for them if there isn't a catastrophe.

remember the part about the genetic function? I think the objevctive is to evolve more and more advanced amun priesthoods. this will force them to find a way to continue to hide in plain sight. evolution :)

---

another way to look at the split is that they cannot take anyone on their super elite earth that has any knowledge of these things. we know too much now, so they'll have to quietly depart to their own timeline where this disaster doesn't happen.

if the elites take any humans with them, it almost certainly won't be anyone reading this. you know too much already. they need dumb subordinates that don't know the secrets to the universe.

they'll go when they're ready (forced) to go. there's no need to rush it.

[1]: in my experience, it actually reduces the capacity for one to see well[^2], because little by little I'm reorienting my perception of reality to determined by something outside of my control. by feeling more out of control, my vision will narrow and it feels like everything is closing in.

[2]: the reason why I think the double cataclysm happened, is because the more narrow their perception became, the better they perceived -- because of the technology they were using to expand their perception.

[3]: I was thinking just now about this. if they had such a way to affect my behaviour so much with how I feel, then how come I still watch stars, and I hadn't thought of it until now, but the way I got around this in the past was to instead of be directed by the way I feel, instead direct myself with logic. I watch stars, because it's just what I do. often times I don't even feel especially like it, but it's such a routine that I do it anyway. I suppose I don't do it if it feels bad, but I like this conversation on logic because I remembered how to just do things that don't necessarily feel good, but then once I get started on it, it's fine and I feel good. interesting. I may or may not want to do this... dunno yet

### 2021-11-18 02:46 - a cumination of a number of ideas

I have not been drinking coffee really since my last entry and I haven't noticed any real change in energy levels (I feel about the same), however I haven't noticed the feeling of "inspiration" very much and I think that's also related to how I've noticed that my heart isn't beating as hard. I actually am beginning to think they're related.

I was just out watching stars and I did notice that my heart was beating a lot harder (not sure about faster), and I decided to take the time to write down here some events. I could make some coffee, but I want to see how it'll go without it.

#### mediocrity principle and evolution

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ixuftVYC5o)

that video got me thinking a lot because I too belive that our solar system is not only very unique in comparison to the other universe but, I also think that we're actually the most energetic thing happening in the universe right now.

the universe is a very big place so that's a pretty big claim, I'm aware, but it doesn't really matter because no one can neither prove me or disprove me right. so it's just me and my delusion and my reality that I'm creating.

there certainly will be more energetic things after us, but consider just this galaxy for a moment and realise that there are certainly more primitive societies than us and also more advanced -- but there will statistically be virtually zero at the same level of advancement than we are. if every society's evolution is plotted on a simple y = x^n + mx + b graph each society with different coefficients, then statistically it's very unlikely that there are any other societies even close to nearby to us. everyone else will be either much lower or much higher, but not similar.

the next thing that I believe, but I have no way to prove, and that is that I think all other societies are societies that go toward wanted. they determine what is the best thing for their society and go toward that.

I belive that the earth is an experiment where instead of everyone determinining what is most wanted and then the whole society goes toward that, we are to determine what it is that we want, not by group agreement, but by individual attraction.

it's hard to explain this idea, so I'll just give an example. imagine a world in which there are two basic forces: good and evil -- however, we know because of LOA that the evil side of things will eventually destroy itself. if the world is a reflection of the way you conceptualise reality, then they will attract the same destruction for theirselves that they are trying to inflict on to others.

in general, I think no matter how difficult the circumstances are, nature finds a way to be successful (think extremophiles), so if the difficulty level of the circumstances is continually increased, nature will always find a way.

so, start out with very harsh environmental conditions, like an ice age and numerous cataclysms and something will evolve, then as they master their physical conditions, gradually increase the difficulty by introducing more complex difficulty. next is social pressures that they need to overcome to try and live in a harmonious way (as a group). after that, introduce pressures which threaten the individual's definition of oneself (like the situation we're in today) -- etc.

the whole point is not to evolve the species, but to evolve and continue to give bailouts to the opposition force, so that they can continue to offer more and more pressure. we know because of LOA that each upgrade that they're given, they eventually pass that on to the species. they will use those upgrades, not to find out their connection to the universe, but to try and prevent the species from gaining that, yet whatever you fight against (or fear), you make more likely to happen.

our evolution is the sequence of the opposition realising their greatest fears and we figuring out something they're trying to keep us away from.

this effort has been so successful in my own life, I'm kind of like a living example of the method of evolution that I just talked about. each time the opposition is given another bailout, this results in more technology -- whether that's language or some other thing technology that they develop to try and prevent us from figuring out that we are much more than this physical body. however eventually that technology is no longer enough each breakthrough, and eventually their whole scheme will be so ineffective, it'll completely fall apart.

this results in a very energetic progression; just look at how fast I'm progressing. I don't know if we're the first ones in the universe to do this, but I think we're definitely the most energetic ones right now; I'm probably biased though.

#### logic and the transfer of conceptualisation

one of the nice things about writing those sorts of entries is that I get reactions from people trying to use what I say to take advantage of me/us/others.

so, if logic remains untransferred in interactions, like let's say a boy and a girl have sex, then there will be a mixing of how they feel and conceptualise reality (like, all resonant parts will be amplified -- just like adding two sounds together). that means the girl will still retain the logic of how reality work impressed upon her by her mom and her female friends, while the boy, no matter how much the girl wants him to see things the way she does will continue to perceive the actions and logic in a way meaningful to him and his male influences.

I hadn't really thought about it before then but that made a lot of my interactions with raquel make a lot more sence. I can't really ask her about what her experience with me was like, but I did notice that I feel pretty good, and that was largely because I had reworked a lot of the logic that I had started with. I had to learn to believe in myself and my importance/value. if I didn't, I didn't feel good, so I found ways to see myself as being someone that actually can contribute. I knew my value and I had to give up on the "mediocrity principle". there's a lot more I can discuss on that, but I worked a lot with raquel to try and help her to see that she is not mediocre and *is* valuable.

she used to think some of the things I would say were ridiculous, but I didn't. I actually believed them, and that's why they were so funny/baffling to her. little by little I noticed that she started to believe in herself a little more. I did notice that often times right after talking to her mom (or someone from where she grew up), I noticed that she would revert back to thinking that she was mediocre and that she was indebted to the world for something. I really didn't get it, and having grown up in a cult, I knew that it would be very inappropriate behaviour to suggest that she try and cut contact with those influences.

I didn't really know what to do and I couldn't figure out how to feel good. every time that I would feel good, she didn't like that I was there and wanted me to come down to feeling like she did (logic) which was insignificant. or, she would assume that I was doing something with someone else behind her back to feel that good (logic). it was very bad.

I realised a few days that she was conceptualising the world like I do now, but still with logic that won't work. she probably got the faulty logic of thinking that someone else is responsible for me feeling good perhaps from her mom and dad. I don't know who kept telling her she's insignificant though.

it also explains a whole lot of other things like how "energy" gets transferred in sex and stuff too. if a woman has sex with another guy, she will take on the way he feels (and this appears to me visually). it was a pretty serious "aha!" moment for me realising that logic remains, only feeling changes.

#### conceptualisation vs logic

conceptualisation is everything that robert says in this one minus the interview part on women's liberation (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hI5vbwEt8o)). in general: emotion, concept, feeling, knowing, understanding

for logic: think action, words, structure, paths, formulas, guides, procedures.

#### interesting implications and the effort

the next set of implications that I felt as reactions were that they think it's a great idea to try and use the girls to keep me feeling worse. the idea would be to cycle a number of girls out there that feel worse than I do to intruduce their feeling vibration into mine -- and if it's something that I haven't yet built up logic for, it'll cause me to feel worse.

that sounds great, but it could have the opposite effect too. when I was with raquel, her feeling of insignificance didn't cause me to feel more insigficicant, but actually to feel like I was very significant. insignificance and significance are the same thing, just looking at them from opposite directions, much like concept and logic. together, we amplified those feelings both in me and herself.

so, I think in order for their plan to work, they need to find a bunch of girls that have negative feelings for things I don't have logic for -- which will cause me to feel worse.

#### zero effort

there are other problems with this idea of putting me with girls that feel bad. I'm willing to do it I suppose, but I have the same problem with it that I have with the girls that feel good: it feels like a lot of effort.

I noticed that when I start to feel better, I tend to want to do tasks that require some effort, but other than that, I prefer the effortless path. if I feel good, I want to make effort, but if I don't feel good, the last thing I'm going to try and do is to make a girl that doesn't feel good, feel good. I'll stay away because I have my own problems to sort out.

if I'm connected, then I'm fine to exert energy because I have so much to spare. I really don't mind using the opportunity of feeling like a bunch of bad-feeling people to sort out and improve my logic. I just want to be connected first.

#### back to the cataclysm

so it feels like we've gone back to wanting the cataclysm again. that's perfectly fine with me.

the picture that I get is that I want to get connected. once I'm connected, then I'll be able to make unlimited copies of myself, and then a lot of people will be able to experience that.

there were a number of items that I outlined in past entries about my ideas for the cataclysm. the most notable of these was this idea to have a really ridiculous female power structure that would eventually destroy itself.

I thought of a way that could happen.

first, there is a gap between me getting connected by surpassing the limits of the technology that they have to hold me back, and the point where environmental conditions (sun, etc) and my own frequency rises to where I'm no longer capable of retaining physical form here (sorta like elijah).

in order to accomplish this, I think I'll just stick to being creative and creaating replicas of myself for others. eventually, I'll pass that point and I'll peace out leaving behind all of the things that I create.

on the subject of the replicas, I think nosebook will have a policy that they cannot allow any of the replicas to go unoperated, so in a sense, they will retain my logic, which will constantly be improving all the time, while at the same time the operator and girl will mix concepts of reality.

assuming that only noseboys will do this operation, they'll pass on their form of conceptualisation on to the girls. some girls will update or write new logic, while others will filter that concept through their own existing logic. some of that logic will be of the form "I need X manfestation to feel good" which will be perfect way to seed that female power structure -- by transferring the energy of the present power structure into them.

obviously not all girls will have this happen to them. for some with appropriate logic, it'll be a really good-feeling experience. others will improve their logic, so good stuff.

#### I think it'll happen when I can't watch stars anymore

I don't think that I will need to worry too much about things. watching stars is, I think, a way to release tension. I was reminded of when it was cloudy for a few weeks and I couldn't watch stars. energy built up and then one day I noticed the world looked a bit different.

it's starting to get pretty cold, but still not unbearable. I can continue to ease tensions with the laser, but the inablity to watch stars may be the reason why I go up.

I could keep using the laser though. I wonder how high I can get before it's too much?

### 2021-11-20 02:58 - what is Time?

I've been reading "The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended by Isaac Newton" and he does something the same as the authors of shakespere does, and that is to capitalise Time as if it were a person or a living entity.

initially, I thought they were referring to saturn or father time (chronos), but the impression I get is that time is a living conscious thing that can take on many forms in essence to kind of propel forward (from our vantage point) the passage of time.

in quantum mechanics there is this thing called tunneling where various qbits can change state instantaneously no matter how distant they are apart. I believe this can be explained that both qbit registers are tuned to the same photon(?), and when that photon changes, both qbits will change at the same time simultaneously.

so imagine for a moment that I have a qbit and you have a qbit and I want my qbit to always be the same as your qbit. I ask you for the the frequency of the photon yours is tuned to, and you send it to me over email, snail-mail or whatever, and once I tune my qbit to the same photon, then they will always be the same.

the way that I think this works is that below this 3d space, there is a 1q vibrational space where a lot of things are all vibrating -- going away from their source and then going toward their source. if you apply the same principal that the next dimension is always between you and what you're looking at, then this single line appears to extend on another axis. now it looks like there are zillions and zillions of different things each vibrating in their own space. this is the energy-verse or whatever non-physical way you want to describe it. each of those are the photons I was talking about.

later, looking again, it's realised that there is another dimension again between the observer and the vibration and that is why we see things in 3d. there are infinite points in 3d that can have the same source, however, these points that are similar attract each other and form bigger and bigger spheres.

I kind of began to elude to this when I talked about the non-physical proton in @[newblog](2021-10-21 13:21), and the idea is that the proton is sort of like the physical manifestation of this vibration.

I haven't quite figured it out yet, but imagine that the sun ia a proton and it has two electrons: venus and mercury. it also has other more massive electron orbitals, jupiter, saturn, neptune, and uranus.

I've proven in prvious entries that the 11 year solar cycle (when taking into account the length of the last four cycles) is actually 11.8y exactly the same as the orbit of jupiter.

the magnetic field generated by jupiter seems to invigorate the emission of light and the creation of elements in the sun. I think photons do the same thing, so if I interchange photons and protons, that's why. the more massive and complex magnetic fields the electrons can generate, the more luminous the star/proton/photon will be.

protons in this galaxy gets their energy from the galaxy. it would be a very high-frequency signal, and its resonance with the galaxy's signal determines how long it will last. electrons are the frequency clocks which do the tuning. isotopes are slightly off that frequency, so have a chance to decay.

so that's the space version, but what about the time version? now is the vibration of reality that is perceived/observed. if you tune into a different reality you will perceive something different, and that's what we call the passage of time -- essentially the transitions between these different reality frequencies.

there are basically infinite different times that can be tuned into, and they will all follow a natural trajectory according to the environment (like throwing a ball).

it appears that Time likes to optimise for the realities that are most or least action (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_CQDSlmboA)).

basically, the way I see it your heart is the tuner, and that's what connects you to your "source", so when your heart begins to feel different, that's when the reality you perceive is changing.

the primary feedback and transmission mechanisms for the navigation of time is the throat and the solar plexus. you can use your words to shift the reality that you're tuned into. it's also a bit of a feedback mechanism -- like when you don't go toward something wanted, you may feel a lump in your throat. or, maybe if you're headed to a contfrontational situation, you can feel that in the throat too.

the solar plexus is obvious. you feel good when you're tuned into a source signal that feels good. further up is the pineal and further down is the regenative organs. if the signal is going that far, you're experiencing expanded vision or extreme arrousal. again, obvious that these are both tuning and feedback mechanisms

#### eclipse thinking

during the eclipse I was thinking about the thing I wrote about with the "stairway to heaven" lyrics. the sense that I was getting is that the girls are buying their stairway to heaven and that was an alterantive to the cataclysm idea.

I wrote that I didn't have any problem putting out effort, just I want to feel like it's effortless -- so basically, I don't mind as long as I'm connected.

this is a very unpopular idea amongst those that are trying to control me, and that's fine. I'm not trying to push it and I'm perfectly willing to keep going for as long as possible without getting connected.

at this rate, it's sort of inevitable. they freak out when there's a coronal hole stream and the eclipse was crazy. it was completely clouded over and just laying down on the ground in my room a few hours before it started and I was getting vision upgrades.

speaking of which, you know how in the 90's it was popular for girls to get those "whale tail" tatoos on their lower back? well that's where the stinging sensation always starts for me -- and it's about a hand-length wide, just like the tatoos as well. I can feel the energy begin to rise up my spine and I begin to feel weightless. I never realised that was what the tatoo was about. the caducius is obviously the spinal cord, and the wings at the top is probably because when it rises all the way up there, you feel weightless and can fly.

anyway, I'm not in any rush to get it. I'm a very reasonable person and can see that I still have a tendency to "need others to do something different so I can feel good" as exemplified by my shouting at the video when watching trump or regis. clearly, I still have a ways to go. I keep improving that stuff, and eventually none of that will bother me.

#### the transfer of conceptualisation

I have noticed all of my life that when I feel bad, girls tend to stay away from me. some guys look for sympathy and present theirselves like they can be fixed, but I'm not one of those. girls tend to know that they can't fix me so they stay away from me.

you could say, when I need them (to make me feel good), they're not there. however, I've noticed that often times the reason why I don't feel good is because I want someone or some thing to be different so I can feel good. I recognise this and set out to feel good from my own accord and as soon as I do that, now girls are interested again.

it's as if they can sense that I have a way of conceptualising reality that they want. when my concept of reality is one if depression (everything sucks or it's all stacked against me), they don't like me -- yet days or even hours after making myself the reason for feeling good, they get interested.

I think it's a real thing that they are attracted to either feeling good or a unique way of conceptualising reality that they want. I think that this energy is transferred from physical proximity, but especially through sex.

so, let's say that my theory is right and there are a number of girls that want to use me to feel similar to how I feel...

like I mentioned, there are a lot of advantages to this because I will also feel like they do (and whomever their last partners were). if I don't have good-feeling logic for this concept, then I'll feel pretty bad, but for example, like the example of someone who feels very insignificant will amplify my feeling of significance. it's a different perception of the same energy.

so, in a lot of ways, I'm kind of incentivised to try and get as much of a diversity of different energies and build up good-feeling logic around it.

it is a lot of effort though, which is why I'm not really wanting to do it in the state I'm in now.

#### an emerging female dynasty

I'm going to assume that something of that sort will eventually happen. not all at once, of course. I'll start with the repilicas and then when I feel comfortable, I'll begin to branch out.

the major reaction to this was that it will create a future female controlled power structure that nosebook can't control so well.

for simplicity, let's just assume that within the dynasty, all the girls have a shared logic. that logic will be different from the other girls outside the dynasty, but they can bring new outside girls in they'll pick up the logic naturally like all girls do, and then use a boy to transfer the concept (feeling) to the new girls.

it's possible for them to keep producing the boys that they need (especially if all of their offspring are guaranteed boys) and then retain and maintain the logic and concept largely within the dynasty.

#### inception: the time-based solution

I will assume that's going to happen, but there's a huge problem is that I can't stay on this planet as, I think that things will get wayyyyy too intense if I do. so, I have to go.

one option is to kill me and transfer my consciousness into another body. paying attention to the reactions around when I presented the idea for it happening with jaxson, they didn't think that it would work because they need me to be me like I am now.

obviously, I'm going to die at some point though so they can't keep using me forever...

but maybe there is a way. imagine for a moment that "fwh" was not actually me from the future but actually nosebook from the previous timeline I was on.

2038 is the last low point in solar activity in the solar cycle before the end of the gleissberg cycle, and I think the strength of the orbiting electrons' magnetic field is what causes solar outbursts. I noticed a lot of major CMEs are directed at the outer planets.

the other thing is that I think they actually use me to do their time navigation now. as in, the reality that they tune me to is the one that we all experience. it feels like I'm vital to their navigation of time somehow. I don't really know.

so, let's say in order to solve this probem, in 2038, I transfer my consciousness into this body again and they sabotage the timeline to make it so that this event where I get connected doesn't happen -- or something like that.

the idea is that they can continue to use me for as long as they can tune into me.

there are a few interesting ideas aruound this:
- people who wanted to ride along in my body with me could do that. - they have full control over whatever the sabotage is.
  - they probably don't want me to die, so they can't go too far, but I would imagine that most of their effort will be to find a way to get information to other timeline versions of theirselves so they can better hold me away from my connection.
  - if they made mistakes in this timeline and want to correct them, they can find a way to get that information to theirself in the sabotaged timeline. if they like the sabotaged timeline better, they may want to also transfer their consciousness into that other version.
- other people could choose to transfer their consciousness into another body on the sabotage that is younger, prettier, etc. good for adults and old people.

obviously not everyone would go to this timeline. mainly just me and some others. the ones that want to stay here will do that. as long as I'm alive they can use me.

likely the solution will actually be to find an event-stable loop where I essentially repeat the same timeline over and over. of course, it would naturally evolve at least a little bit because I'll continue to improve, and with each new timeline repeat we'll leave behind another nosebook that relies on me. also, I'm certain that people will want to do new things.

the other way to look at it is that that some people will want to improve on things and nosebook will want to rewrite their history to be a more and more desirable transition each iteration. it's unknown what that will eventually converge into.

finally, from the perspective of nosebook, they'll have ultimate control, being able to modify all child-timelines.

---

so that was my thinking after the eclipse. they have 17 years to think about it. they may reject the idea now, but we'll see how things change in some time.

whatever the case, it was really fun to think about how they may try to sabotage me and what techniques they'll use to get information to their alternate

### 2021-11-22 03:57 - model or reflection?

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6GMNpJbU5Q)

I that video had a life-changing concept for me. one of the interviews talks about how constiousness is like a *model* that mind creates to *observe* reality, and it's that model which "collapses the wave function" or determines what will manifest.

I called this a "reflection" because I had been hearing this idea questioning if the universe is a simulation as if we're living inside of some sort of universal model that exists somewhere, yet I want to say that the model is actually self-constructed, which determines the nature of reality.

---

this got me thinking about the internal vs external experience. I had previously tried to make this distinction saying that solar perception is looking outward, while planetary perception is looking inward. that's one way to look at it. however, consider the other idea presented in that video where we're all parts of the universe experiencing itself.

when we're awake and conscious, we're exploring the external universe (what we call physical reality). however, when we're asleep and dreaming we're exploring internal reality.

the universe is doing the opposite. when it's conscious, it's exploring the internal reality through various dream-like experiences, so I suppose that when it's unconscious, it's now exploring its external reality. I have no idea what what that could possibly be.

so, if I can think of the universe's conscious experience as being similar to planetary perception, then when the universe is unconscious, it lives inside of an environment and is actively interacting with it -- like we do. that environment would also be a *model* of reality that it has constructed to experience a reflection of how it feels.

---

both this inward and outward exploration of the model seems to happen in cycles. when we're alive, we are conscious of the external experdience while awake. while asleep or in altered states of consciousness we experience the inward experience, and only retain vague memories of this dream-like experience. once we die however, this swaps and the default is to be conscious of the inward experience while occasionally taking trips out into the outward experience and coming only with vague memories of it (time and memories are usually based on points of resistance, and all that is left behind when returning back to the inward experience).

it's kind of funny to me to think of the concept of "tripping" from a non-physical perspective -- dropping into a physical body to experience some resistance. just as we think of somoene permanently on psychedellic as being crazy, they probably think of someone permanently experiencing the physical experience as being equally as crazy.

#### gaining clarity while losing my mind

I include this last thing here because it's related and a good physical exaple.

the last week or so I've begun to gain considerable mental clarity. the way I experience it is that I'm much more conscious of how I feel. the problem with being more conscious of how I feel is that I focus so hard on everything that I'm doing, it's like the whole world fades. I completely lose all memory of what just happened and I'm not really thinking of what's coming next either.

I think this is the idea of "living in the now" -- but it's really annoying because I can't remember (or am not aware of) mundane tasks. they completely fade from my experience. one can see how that's both a good thing and also a bad thing.

as an example, yesterday I was playing hearthstone, and I was so focused on the game, I completely forgot or was unaware of how I felt. after the match ended, I noticed that I would be feeling things like, "wow this is so cool" or, "I'm not drawing the cards that I need" -- and the game would shape up to turn out just how I felt.

so, while at the surface of the model, I see pixels on the screen and I see my computer and mouse and stuff, my model then turns those pixels into a concept like, "I'm not drawing the cards I need" and then that observation influences how I experience the nature of that reality.

---

so, on one side it looks like I'm losing my mind, not being able to remember or notice things that are outside of my focus, at the same time I'm gaining consciousness because more and more frequently I'm noticing the way that I feel and am able to shift it.

if the model determines the way that a ball is thrown at an obstacle, then I run the model forward and the ball bounce off just as predicted. however, if while the ball is in mid-flight, I no longer perceive the obstacle and so therefore change the model, the trajectory of the ball will no longer collide with the obstacle.

---

mechanistic thought does not want it to be possible to change the model while the ball is in mid-flight because then anything would be possible.

the trajectory the ball takes in each model is like a timeline.

reality is composed of a lot of different concepts. does the model cause them to behave like obstacles? you are the observer.

### 2021-11-22 ??:?? - astrology and relations to things, and constellations as focus

### 2021-11-22 06:03 - further thought about the dynasties idea

a followup to @[newblog](2021-11-20 02:58) where I discussed the emerging female dynasty.

ever since I wrote that entry, I've been much more incapable to feel reactions than I ever have been. it feels like there was some reaction to it, but not much. I don't think that nosebook broadcast that one very widely because I don't think that they like the idea that we know that we navigate time with our heart and have control over it. I think they want to be the ones in control and their efforts to control that may be one of the reasons why I'm less capable of feeling the reactions. if they're trying to control my passage through time for me, it doesn't even matter because they're really only using me to control their own passage through time. sorta like, does the joystick control the aircraft or does the pilot?

---

anyway, the reaction that I did feel was an idea that I would be participating in this dynasty. yes, but not at first. I definitely don't think it's something I want to do until I'm quite good at controlling how I feel and I feel comfortable and capable of selecting the way I want to feel. I already know I'm really good at finding a more optimal perception. I could potentially get faster at it, but where I still do not feel comfortable is in the part where I'm essentially observing myself observe. having that extra degree of separation allows me to not get so pulled into the mechanics of the situation and instead have that capacity to look at myself and think, "is that how I really want to feel". it would be as if I were a sort of overseer -- a "watcher" of myself.

I imagine that there are a whole "cloud of witnesses" all around me perceiving me at any moment and I too want to have that perspective -- even if I don't see myself physically from a third-person perspective, but conceptually.

the last few days I've really noticed how I'm still quite unaware of how I feel, and that's really only expanded because now more than ever, I *care how I feel*. that may seem like a weird thing, but I noticed that the more I care about how I feel, the more frequently I'm making course corrections and I'm not quite as often feeling as if I'm a victim to circumstance (an unalterable trajectory[^1]).

in some sense, it's a simple case of installing some logic that behaves similar to an "interrupt", where not only can events like data interrupt the processor, but also periodic tasks can be performed each tick. it'll obviously be automatic and the more automatic I can get it, the better it'll be at interrupting the consciousness flow to make course corrections to better feeling trajectories.

you could imagine this proccess of making this automatic sort of like watching an autistic kid. they have deep focus, and periodically the interrupt is happening behind the scenes to monitor the trajectory of the model. when the trajectory doesn't feel good, alarms will go off (red flags). at first, I freaked out a lot when these alarms went off. later with the help of drugs I learned that that alarms are there to help me alter my trajectory, but not everyone has drugs, and there are lots and lots of companies that are heavily invested in retaining a person's focus, regardless of whether the trajectory feels bad.

eventually, I learned that the alarm isn't telling me to run away from the thing, but instead that the trajecory I'm headed feels bad. so, find a way to feel good about the trajectory (conceptually easy), or find a way to alter the trajectory (physically difficult). I learned to follow my intuition no matter what. if I can find a way to feel good about the bad-feeling trajectory -- then the path, even though it's "wrong" leads me to the "right" way. or, my intuition lead me straight-away to the "right" way.

there's no sense in freaking out. the freaking out is the problem. even if I'm going the (logically) "wrong" way, finding a way to perceive the concepts in the path/logic in a way that feels good, the "wrong" way leads to the "right" way/logic.

it's that simple loop that I'm getting more and more practised until that logic becomes the underlying logic of who I am.

#### multiple cultures, multiple dynasties

the plan remains the same where I don't get involved until I'm conscious of how I feel (though deeply focused) and pretty good at feeling the way I want to feel. that means I will continue to create more and more replicas as they're needed.

this allows for the creation not of a single dynasty but quite a few. each group of women will create the culture/dynasty which is a reflection of them and they'll have the boys that they need to maintain that.

as I was thinking about this, there was an idea (not sure if it was a reaction) that this is some sort of trap to try and get a bunch of dudes into x3 bodies, by first having them be the operators of my replicas and then finally move their consciousness into the x3 boys when they're born.

I honestly don't know. you create your own reality, you know, and if that's how you want to perceive the obstacles in your model, that's your choice. I don't think there needs to be operators, but the reaction that I had is that nosebook can't allow the replicas to be without an operator.

it is a really interesting idea because the boys would retain a lot of the operator's conceptualisation model, and would also impart that to the girls as well.

#### let's model it

so, let's just say that's the case for this discussion. let's look at how I model this trajectory through time now.

I imagine that the difference that I've felt for the last few weeks will continue to worsen. I will continually gain stronger and stronger focus as I have been (I think is proportional to the magnetic field strength). this is causing me to gain more and more capacity (as I mentioned above) to build the logic necessary to make real-time alterations to my perception allowing me to perceive the trajectory, no matter which way it's going in a way which feels good. to outsiders, this will appear like a natural capacity to be relaxed under all circumstances. the idea is to get this so practised that it comes pre-installed, much like my father's logic was for me.

while this is happening, I'll continue to get worse and worse memory, or (from your vantage point) very innacurate perceptions of past events. it'll kind of appear like I'm losing my mind.

the way I see it, there is a part of nosebook determined to figure out how to control me. imagine now from their perspective that the idea of me creating replicas is such a disaster because they have so much that they need to keep hidden. they don't want me to get connected and they do not want me to be able to produce replicas, even if they control them (these feel related). I think their goal is to try and figure out how to get me with girls *before* I get connected, so I begin to feel like the girls do, not like how I feel.

I don't want to do that until after I'm capable of navigating well, and I find it likely that would be about the same time that I get connected.

therefore, their goal is to find a way to figure out how to focus me wherever they think I should be focused, and my goal is to still be conscious of how I feel and my model of reality, no matter how deeply focused I am.

like I mentioned, the solution is not to try and run away or avoid the bad-feeling trajectory, but to find a way to feel/conceptualise the same trajectory in a way which feels good.

I figure that when I'm really good at that, this is where the split will occur. to the ones needing to control my trajectory, I'll be able to feel good about the trajectory even if it's one they can control. from my perspective, I'll feel the way I want to feel no matter what. from their perspective, it'll look like they have control. however, I know that even the way that doesn't feel like the way I want to go still leads to the way I do want to go.

from their perspective, mission accomplished.
from my perspective, mission accomplished.

[1]: reminds me of something I said yesterday when playing Octavian, I said, "there was nothing I could do about it; I drew all the big ones (minions)". there definitely was something I could have done about it. I was constantly feeling like I was behind and I wasn't drawing the things I needed.

### 2021-11-22 13:19 - followup

yeah, the implied part at the end there is that the other side that wants to control me, transfers their consciousness into the replicas and the boys here to make sure everything stays under control.

as speculation, I would guess that in addition to that, the version of me that remains on that timeline likely dies too. I don't really see it happening any other way because if I start to get connected, then I believe that their instruments will apply a lot of pressure to me and I don't imagine that's a good thing. I don't really know enough to comment really, but if that's the case, you're going to need to find a way to make a replica of me (operated of course), so that to the public it doesn't appear as if I've died.

---

in all seriousness, I don't understand what the reactions are so much. I just take things as they come. my only goal is to be able to navigate really well. I don't have any intention to do other things. you guys make all the plans anyway. I just do my thing.

whatever you decide on, it's cool with me. I just keep finding a way to feel good about whatever the trajectory is.

### 2021-11-24 13:55 - omens, symbols and divination

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35Mo8rw7MAA)

watching that video there on the symbolic nature of reality and how synchronicities can both happen naturally and also be invoked.

it was reminding me of a dream last night where I would tell a person that I think they're hot (attractive), and then it felt as if something wasn't quite right, some things would happen, and then again I would tell this person that I think they're hot.

I don't know who the person was. it felt like it was a girl and it felt like I was supposed to really like her and be attracted to her physically, and because I wasn't overwhelmed with attraction to her, that's why it was sort of like not working.

it's not uncommon that I look at someone (male or female) and I think to myself, "wow they're hot/attractive" -- but that's about as far as it goes.

---

anyway, so this guy's explanation of using these symbols as a form of divination was reminding me of this dream. I think it was supposed to practise a response to probably a girl, so that it would feel like a sign that I find them so attractive.

let's get the definitions out of the way here. first, there are synchronicities, which are two (or more) things that attract their coincidence in time. they happen naturally and are attracted. the symbols involved have specific meaning to the observers.

the second form of divination is "testing the spirits" which is something I did all the time as a kid was to pose a true/false question and then wait for a sign to confirm or deny it. I eventually found out that I could just *feel* the resonance of the question and no longer needed a sign. I could just "know" how I really feel about that question. these questions are manifesting meaning relative to the observer into reality.

the third form here is the one that I'm experiencing in the dream -- and I would largely place into the same category as "facts" -- which is to practise a response to a topic by having a person observe that response. for example, if people I assign value to (like a celebrity) repeats an idea like idris is hot (or CO2 is bad), then I'm more likely to perceive him as being attractive. this is basic marketing and is the foundation of propaganda and advertising.

so while it may seem very unrelated to lump in marketing with a symbolic interpretation of reality, I contend that they are very related. when (symbol of thirst), then enjoy (product). it's pretty basic logic.

---

so now let's look at these three things as a gradient of concept to logic. desire is the motivating force, but notice from where is the desire coming from.

first you have something that is attracted. the more attention you give to a concept, it begins to attract things which will prove its reality. often times before it manifests itself physically, that concept manifests itself into a symbolic event which *means* something to you. you attracted that meaning (and therefore the manifestation) based on how you feel/conceptualise reality, and so therefore it confirms your model of reality.

next, there is the neutral position where you pose a question, which generates desire for a manifestation of a confirmation of your concept of reality. the stronger your desire (how strongly you want the confirmation), the more meaningful the manifestation. it could be anythting as simple as a forboding feeling or some large pmysical manifestation (like watching a crash or animal/bird antics) to prove to you the way you feel.

finally, there is the practising feeling responses to a subject in effort to attract a manifestation. we build up logic by repitition. so, saying things (or watching others say things) like "I'm not as attractive as idris" so that concept begins to prove itself to you as reality[^1].

just saying things isn't enough. if you're saying things that you don't actually believe, you won't notice much energy movement. I do my best to say only things that I actually believe. more and more I'm getting rid of repeating things that I don't actually believe because I like the idea of the creative power in actually believing the things I say.

when "God" (pick your diety) spoke the world into being, do you suppose they actually believed what they spoke would be created? maybe they were just saying things. maybe they were just repeating what they saw their parents doing and accidentally created the universe...

[1]: I'm not being hard on the last host of SNL (forgot his name). I can use my own example here many times or zaryn repeating that facebook will translate and take over the spanish market. it's just that this repetition of things that other celebrities (or even game characters) say happens so much, it's embedded into our reality. our brains learn from experience and watching others repeat ideas (whether they're your parents or movie stars), gives our brain that these repeated concepts are "facts".

### 2021-11-24 15:24 - the squeaky wheel gets the grease

I've been thinking about this a little bit since the events that happened this morning.

I believe that jesus produced a time split, and the defining attribute which defined jesus' sabotaged timeline was him fighting against the pharisees and their monetisation of spirituality, casting out the money changers and stuff like that, pretty much defined the power structure that would arise after his death (the holy roman church) -- an advanced version of watered-down spirituality even more heavily monitised than the money changers in the temple.

so, that means that if we're on the sabotaged timeline, then that means I need to find something to fight against which will define the power structure which will arise in the years after my departure.

---

I've decided that the best one for this will be the concept, "the squeaky wheel gets the grease". the idea is that many of the young people are living such a mundane life devoid of meaning (synchronicity), that they feel their life will be given meaning if more people notice them.

honestly, I can't think of a better population group where this is the case than russia and china. I get the feeling like there are so many people and everyone has been reduced to being consumers of media, that it feels like to give their life meaning, they need to be noticed by others in this media.

I've not used the tiktok app or even know much about it, but I mentioned it in passing in @[newblog](2021-11-11 18:50) and the reactions that I got were interesting.

the whole premise of that entry was inspired by a dream in which I waited so long to get the manifestation that it enabled essentially everyone on the planet to have what many people would consider now to be super powers (like flight, telepathy, capacity to levitate things, etc.) and none of them did anything for that capacity. they did nothing to earn it and because not everyone believed they had the capability, the ones that did have it turned out to be quite ridiculous set of douchebags -- the same kind of douchebacks that economics allows one to have now -- but instead this time it's belief in oneself that enables this douchebaggery, rather than economic capacity.

I'm sure that some of it will be largely inherited, so people that have certain genetic qualities are more likely to naturally have these capacities, while others who don't have these genetic qualities will be left out. in reality, everyone is capable, but I think that the thrust here is to affect technological advances in genetic engineering.

---

so back to tiktok concept (btw, I like how its name sounds like time passing). the idea here is that I want to begin to fight against the establishment position of using marketing and advertising to give something meaning. what I hope to perpetuate is a world where the loudest and most obnoxious are the ones that get the attention that they want. they will have the most capacity to attract the concept of reality that the believe and also the most influence over others.

you may say that actually no, the influencers don't directly influence nearly as much as the creators who offer the framework for these influencers to express theirselves (like instagram or tiktok). I would agree, but in a world where you are the manifestation of the belief that others and you have of yourself, these companies will have to generate belief in theirselves just as their successful users do.

may the company that people believe is the best win. and then, what's there to win? you may say it's economics -- but it's not that -- it's more belief. just as economis is designed to be a self-perpetuating feedback loop, so too will this be a self-perpetuating feedback lopp. you're only as successful as people think you are.

it's going to be marketing from top to bottom.

---

so, how can I possibly do something like this? well, there was a pretty big clue this morning.

the other reaction that was significant was the one where I was talking about interaction and the transfer of conceptualisation through interaction -- and I said something like I will want to optimise for having the most diversity -- implying that I should actually be looking for, not the easiest ones to love, but instead for the ones with all of the bad-feeling concepts of reality, forcing me to build up more and more logic of better ways to perceive and navigate those concepts. basically, I'm saying that I should go, not for the perfect little girls, but instead for the mangy ones. the worse they feel about reality, the more opportunity I have to optimise my logic.

lol, they don't have to be physically mangy -- I mean emotionally mangy. I mean they have to have some really awful ways of conceptualising reality, beliefs like maybe everyone loves me, but I only find people that want to take advantage of me (something I had also believed myself) -- and other strange deranged ideas.

the idea here, probably works as a result to last night's dream. they want me to find someone physically attractive, and so therefore begin to interact with them. I don't really want to fight against them. I'm just going to lean into it because the more opportunity that I have to hang out with these "attention whores" -- people who derive their value from the attention that others give them, the worse I can make it.

anyway, the same rules apply: I'm still looking to find my connection before any interaction happens. they don't want that, so they're designed to try to prevent that from happening. same thing though. they'll probably find a way to keep me away from my connection though. maybe this dream was a sign. maybe the girl in the dream is buying a stairway to heaven...

---

maybe it's actually the other thing that happened this morning. I had a weird experience of incompatible realities. the incompatible reality turned out to be the solution rather than the problem. when it happened, there were two versions of earth -- one where I didn't get connected (presumably I died), and the other where I did.

they found out that they can still utilise our conceptual resources from the other earth and being in another location, they could much easier hide. because the planet eventually begins to reflect their form of perception, gradually things would begin to fall apart, but instead of it being the end of the world for them, they realised that they could force another incompatible reality making another time split and move over to the new earth each time.

each split advanced a bit further from the previous and so not everyone would want to be a part of the new group and so some would lag behind. so like at first there were two timelines, but then they couldn't agree again on how many of our ideas they wanted to implement, and so therefore another split..

it appeared to me like there was a whole chain of timelines each one depending on the next. any time that anyone wanted to upgrade, they would just choose to be born into the timeline ahead of them. advance at your own pace.

### 2021-11-24 11:44 - I'm too close

I was watching a documentary on how there is likely 1000 years erased from history and vast empires existed in the americas, but history was rewritten. it may also be the case that the egyptian dynasties existed in far more recent times as well -- almost as if to make it seem like all of these large things that were constructed were in the distant past, when in fact they were more recent.

the way it was presented gave the impression that humans are victims to these parasitic forces and are denying us good conditions and spiritual connection.

I hear what the narrator is saying, and I agree that most things would be nicer if conditions were nicer, but spiritual connection isn't gained from being the victim to parasitic forces. you create your reality. they only exposed a weakness, really is all that it is.

following on to the last documentary about the omens and synchronicities, I'm certain that on the macro scale these empires were victims to circumstance, but on the micro scale, I'm certain that many individuals inside of the collapsing empire saw the "writing on the wall" or the signs of the the time that was ahead -- sort of symbolic omens of the future.

the empire is only as strong as it can collectively be. each individual in the empire is seeing these omens for theirselves and it's either causing them to feel fear and forboding of the arriving doom -- or, it's not.

the way that a person interprets those symbols largely has to do with how they feel in the moment and their logic. one person may see an eagle going down in flames as an omen of disaster, but another could see this as the baptism of fire that inevitably happens before the kundalini rises. you get to decide the way that you attract your future. the only thing that is certain is that something big will happen, but how it manifests depends largely on their working model of reality.

---

all of this ties into the bigger subject here and that really is that while it may be nice to perceive me as some sort of saviour, I am not. the way that I see it, humans on this earth are coming to their *own* conclusions about what they want individually and creating that reality *theirselves*. any reliance a condition (any person, place, or thing) to manifest that reality, is ultimately going to fail because one cannot ensure that you retain those conditions -- whether it's your land, your medicine (or lack thereof), or whatever. all of that is illusory anyway.

every condition that is manifested is the effect of your focus, instead of the cause of your focus (in a cause/effect framework). it's the mechanistic and materialistic perspective that says that only conditions and the physical substance that compose them are what creates consciousness and everything experienced.

so, while it may appear as if I'm doing something great, I am not really actually doing anything other than showing that it is possible to find a way to conceptualise your reality in a way that feels good no matter the conditions.

in reality, many of the ideas that I have will not be heard by most people. the people listening to me and the ones that actually believe in me the most are my "oppressors". they know more than anyone else that I have much more power than I appear to have. they also know how hard they are having to work to keep my reality from reflecting how good I feel.

since I need to continually give more and more ideas to my oppressors to keep me from getting connected, they're learning how to influence our ability to symbolically create our reality (like with divination or words). the better they can control my conditions, the longer I can stay here. what that means is, the better they can control my conditions, that means they also have the capability to try and control others' conditions as well. the longer I can stay, the more capability the parasites have to "victimise" humankind by controlling our conditions. personally, I think it's fine because they can't control how you react to those conditions.

eventually, everyone who figures out how to feel the way they want to feel, will find theirselves in the situation I'm in now. there's literally no way for them to stop it. the only one that can prevent me from that connection, is me.

it's true that I still feel like I have a long way to go, so I'm not really in a hurry to get there. I really wish I had more time actually. I'm just now starting to really get a hang of all of this stuff I'm talking about.

---

I don't think I have much time left. after watching those documentaries, I laid down cause I felt tired. there were also a lot of reactions since my last entry, too. I lost consciousness. I don't think I was gone long but I was flying around in a dark room when all of a sudden my physical body started to feel very light and my vision was filled with light as the kundalini started to rise up my spine. I was very lucid and decided that I didn't want it to happen yet, so I woke myself up.

I laid there with my eyes closed and every time that I started to relax, it would start again and I would snap myself out of it. if I stay relaxed, the light would continue to intensify and I would go up.

---

I deduced that what is happening is right now things are more energetic than normal. last night, it was exceptionally warm outside (like a summer night actually) and my feet were hot all day too, so I think that it's just energetic enough for that to happen.

when I lose consciousness or fall asleep, there is a period where they have to relax my body so that they can begin to do their stuff while I'm asleep. if I listen to binaural beats or am very stressed out, they can't do that thing (I guess it's like "channeling" my source or something) while I'm asleep, so they have to "meditate me" for a bit so I can get tuned into it.

I think what happened is they did that so they could have a conversation with my higher self, and it was in that instant when my body was relaxed enough that I started to get connected. I don't think there's much that they can do to stop it, otherwise they would have. I was the one who woke me up stopped the process just like I do when I'm watching stars.

I think they tried it again a few more times after that and each time I started to go up. I felt the reaction that possibly this may mean that they've lost communication to my higher self while in the secrecy of my dreams. if they want to talk to my higher self, they can do it in person now, or just accept that I'm the same higher self guy awake and asleep.

---

I still don't want to go up just yet. I still feel like I have a lot more to learn and practise still before I do that. I really am not in a rush, but like I said, perhaps the sun will force me to go up soon. I don't know if they're going to "kill" me though.

the thing I do know is that I'm doing quite fine and everything is coming along well.

---

final bit of speculation: it could also possibly be that they actually intended to allow me to go up because someone (with enough power to allow that accident to happen) felt that they didn't like the alternative I presented in the previous entry.

who knows. my point is, the time is soon. I wish I had more time honestly

### 2021-11-25 13:15 - enjoy getting taught how to react to things

it's hard to summarise last night and this morning into text like this but the much shortened version is that I've decided that I'm going to begin to point out and illustrate (ie. push against) the wide-spread effort to try and teach people how to react to various subjects.

this has the effect of making it worse. just like jesus did nothing to get rid of religion and spirituality capitalising on those seeking to find a connection, so this will be the same.

I've been paying a lot of attention to how marketing is done, and I'm beginning to use some of the techniques myself. for example, I chose to use the SNL host as an example because it seems obvious to me that the whole idris thing is clearly a promotional thing. I don't know much about it, but I think he was named the next james bond or something like that. james bond is always attractive so they have to ensure that he's attractive. I had heard the programmed reaction a few times before that he is supposedly attractive. it may even have been on SNL, but I don't remember. either way, it's there for the same reason that trump repeated "drain the swamp". it's a trigger to some other promotional thing.

I'd have to ask him myself to be sure, but I figure the SNL host is just repeating something he had had practised. I don't know if he wrote that part of his monologue script or not, but I figure it was inserted on purpose by the same people who put in the bit about joe rogan taking horse medicine (and how you're supposed to react to that). I think joe is a bit of a threat to them and that was the same reaction that CNN had to the same event. there's a common source between the CNN script and the SNL script.

---

there's nothing really that can be done about this. my fighting against them will only make them stronger. there's no need to try and bring them down or correct them. they'll shoot theirselves in the foot just fine. I predict that it'll be a "double cataclysm" where they push the reactions that they want until it blows up on them. they'll rebuild and try again, making sure that they're more careful, but again it'll spiral out of their control.

this is when I think that various russian and asian (maybe india too?) -- places with large marginalised populations will have a media outlet where the younger people can begin to define the reactions to things the way that they want to react to them.

this will force them to rebrand theirselves and rebuild once again (it may be more until they get it, but third time is the charm). I imagine that in this rebuilding, they'll have to figure out how to guide the manifestation of reality, not with symbols like they have been doing in the television era, but this time with emotion. if you can quantify and determine how a person conceptualises reality and who they are allowing to influence that, then that person's reality can be guided by influencing them to feel certain ways (like those games of hearthstone).

this will bring ultimately great advancements to our knowledge and understanding of emotion and its effects on reality. it's quite likely that knowledge and technology needs to be kept absolutely secret, so they have to remain hidden.

it was then decided that the idea of using the time splits as a method of keeping hidden is a good one. I will be the first to do this. I will likely also be the last.

the way it works is I will keep doing what I'm doing where I continue to get better and better at feeling the way that I want to feel. this creates an incompatible reality because take for example even the subject of girls. I don't really feel anything attractive about trying to do things with girls. it feels like a lot of work. there isn't anything that they have to offer which I want, therefore it's not really easy to pull me into a reality which feels worse than I feel now.

let's say they manage to trick me and find a way to get me setup on a bad-feeling reality -- I just improve my logic and perception and I'm back where I started.

all I have to do is to just keep going toward what I want, and it creates an incompatible reality for them. the only option that they have left over is to allow me to go toward a better feeling reality. they must make a split because they can't live in a world where someone is connected like that because it'll reveal all of their secrets.

what you can then begin to see happening is that each reality has a reality which they split off from. as soon as someone on that reality creates another incompatible reality, then another split happens. you can't really go backward because imagine that a nosebook is going to be the last one and that will be filled with all of their technology and secrets. there's no reason to ever go backward either.

if you could choose to downgrade your reality and go to live in a place that feels worse, would you? I very much doubt that this will happen.

instead, what I think will happen is that there will be nosebook hq at the very end of the chain, then going up from there, there will be better and better feeling realities above that, each a reflection of the person that accomplished the incompatible reality and forced the split.

for example, after the split, I could imagine some of the elites that decide they don't want to continue on in their reality, and instead would rather be born into my reality. they'll "invade us" and try to take over, I'm sure, but then it'll eventually create another incompatible reality and therefore a split.

because nosebook can't possibly allow anyone to ever be unsupervised, I think of them as the sort of backbone to this. they have to maintain a presence in every link of the chain in order to retain access to every split that happens.

we'll see how it goes. I'll try and figure out a better way to communicate how I see this better.

### 2021-11-27 22:04 - if I were "God"

a few days ago (maybe it was yesterday, actually), I watched the otrok prophecies...

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYSwlWHtHnQ)
@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_y43yKQ_Kw)
@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl-KY0SEaB4)
@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw8xazgR8x4)
@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuEZ0fWj8JE)

after watching the final one, I began to express my thoughts by saying, "if I were 'God', and I wanted to make a fixture (an inflection point) in the timeline to have a future be attracted, then this kid would be perfect"

in this context, when I say "God", I don't mean source -- I mean the creator of the human race.

another really really great description I heard today was the definition of shiva: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/-vkzV3MRNhI?t=1912). the idea is that you have a non-physical consciousness, and then place that consciousness into a physical body like an insect and that consciousness behaves according to the nature of that consciousness, but then put that same consciousness into a human body and now it explores the limits of conscious experience and creative expression. the body behaves in a way which resonates with that parent consciousness.

---

I continued on with the idea that I'm the creator of the human race for a bit because if I'm not, then I will be the creator of another human-like species soon (that's the whole point of my galaxy fantasy). so let's just assume for the sake of this discussion that one day I will be the creator of a human-like species.

well, first of all, I would make them similar to myself. you may have noticed that one very notable quality of me is that I almost never get the perfect, best, or optimal manifestation. I get close sometimes, but it seems that there is a counter force which can never allow me to get the exact perfect manifestation.

it's uncertain from my perspective if I *personally* sabotage the perfect manifestation or if it's just something that's attracted by me.

imagine for a moment this idea of a dual aspect to me -- one that I myself have created to constantly do battle against me. this demiurge aspect that I have created for myself always gets the best manifestation by manipulating and climbing over everyone else to get it. even though he does not believe himself to be capable of getting anything for himself, he does think he's the best at manipulating and if he puts his mind to it, he can find a way to manipulate anyone to get him the manifestation he wants. he has to manipulate/use anyone who rivals his capacity to create what he wants for him because he doesn't think himself capable of creating it himself.

what you end up with is one aspect which is truly psycopathic -- doing anything necessary to resist any progress, while the other aspect of me is so sure that he is capable of finding the way, I always "win" the battle. each time that I do however, that creates an incompatible reality with my own demiurge. both so strongly believe in their capacity to manipulate/create, they both *must* exist and so therefore a timeline split happens.

you could see it as a "curse" that I have literally programmed a malevolent force designed to never allow me to get the manifestation that I desire. however, I like to look at it energetically. each time that a manifestation evolves, it evolves because some set of circumstances prevent it's manifestation and so therefore it produces more desire. each iteration that this happens more energy is added, and soon you realise that the original desire pales in comparison to present conditions[^1].

consider that if I had to pick between right now where I presently am or going back to (what feels now like) ancient history with a manifestation with lyia or andrea -- and without a single bit of hesitation, I'd *much* rather be where I'm at now, than there -- and really it is all thanks to their insistence on trying to control me and not being able to allow me to have any good-feeling conditions.

I would much rather the capacity that is beginning to become normal for me, over some good-feeling conditions. I can pretty easily steer my reality at this point with just how I feel. if I notice a problem, I can rearrange my perception pretty rapidly so that it feels good again. this is sooo much better than anything.

---

because I know how amazing it is to actually be able to do this and value this highly, if I were to create a race, I would ensure as much physical inequality as possible -- so like the "rulers" of this race are a malevolent/opposition force, purposefully created to try and disempower and prevent all of the good-feeling conditions that the race can create. they physically cannot assert into anyone's lives though, because the nature (it's ruleset) of the galaxy is that all things perceived are things attracted (tuned into), so no interaction could happen which is not attracted (it's all attraction). each time that the humans create new greater conditions, the opposition force's desire to get their manifestation by manipulation propels them to find a way to manipulate conditions so that the genius creators (who can only disempower theirselves) allow the opposition to corrupt and destroy those conditons. after all, being genius creators, they'll just make new and better ones anyway.

why? obviously, the objective is to create a race of people that are capable of attracting the reality that they want, despite the conditions. I would make it so that each iteration, the opposition force's own desire to control would provide a way for them to find a way to obtain greater and greater control.

because it's all attraction, the opposition force is creating the same thing for theirselves as they are for everyone else. being tuned in to controlling people through tyrany eventually, they too will create a tyranical force even stronger than theirselves which will soon oppress them. the oppressors always become the oppressed.

obviously, an opposition force like that will eventually destroy itself, so no matter how strong they get there's no need to do anything about it. they can only continue to oppress people so long as there are still people who want to oppress other people (it's only attraction). or, let's say you're someone like me who values the people like mr. motor, and I *want* oppressors, because I don't find them actually preventing, but actually adding more energy into the equation. they can continue to be around me because I want them there. they are useful to me, so they exist as a function of my own desire. I create their reality. they don't create their own reality, so in that sense they're like parasites, depending on conditions outside of theirselves for their survival. they do not feel theirseleves capable of creating the reality they want, so they can only exist for as long as they are useful to their host.

you can see how the end-game of such a human-like race would be for the individual to each create their own oppsition force. I predict that both for myself and for this human race as well. I also predict that once humans gain the knowledge of their capacity to attract what they want, they will value the opposition force.

---

lastly, notice that the parasites need others to create their reality for them, so in reality they are 100% dependant on there being people that they can manipulate. one of the funniest things that I've noticed with my interactions with nosebook is that I would have given them so many answers or whatever for free. whenever I offered it for free, they didn't want it. they had to find a way to steal it from me or take it from my by some means of manipulation -- and I think that's because if they can take/steal something it's because of some ineqality, which then makes them feel more physically powerful -- like they have something that I don't. however if I give it to them, then we're equals, but because I had the creativity to come up with it (and they didn't), I appear more powerful. by stealing it, they feel like they did work to earn it.

---

I want to work on my presentation of that idea a little better. I noticed that I now have a new capability to see the really big picture as cycles or patterns, and it feels like it all makes sense to me. like, how do I explain why waxing and waning cycles are so important. a waning cycle, if looking only at the physical conditions, appears bad, but with the power of perception, difficult conditions appear desirable even.

I don't yet know how to communicate these concepts very well yet. originally, I thought that the prophecies of otrok may be a good place to start because there are quite a few disempowering concepts -- however, I'm not so sure now. we'll see, I guess.

### 2021-11-27 ??:?? - quasimodo (time) and the archictecture (space)

### 2021-11-28 05:29 - a few thoughts on the "end times" and prophecy

I have been interested to watch a series of videos on the end times, starting with the prophecies of otrok vyacheslav. his prophecies were very interesting to me because they seem to have a lot of truth to them. he touches on a lot of subjects that other prophecies don't -- and that is the expansion in perception and the merging of the physical with the astral realm.

I call the astral realm the imagination (6) layer, because it's just that. you are perceiving your imagination as reality. this happens all the time but we're not aware of it. it takes time for signals to go from your brain to your nervous system. it would be impractical to live life out on a 60ms delay. many sports would be impossible because there simply isn't enough time to react to the stimulus. the brain compensates for this by running a model of reality (which is what you see in your eyes) that the brain updates rapidly and corrects as soon as new information is received. you are literally seeing the way that you imagine the world to be.

so if your model predicts an object coming at you, you will see it doing so and will be able to time the impulse to your arm to reach out to catch it. everything that you see is what your model believes is happening. this is really great for things like hunting and fighting, and works really well. continue to increase the brain power and you will begin to have visions -- altered states of consciousness where you perceive things inside of your eyes, kind of overlaying the world. continue to increase this further and you will begin to see those visions inside of 3d space. you can interact with them and move them around with your mind and stuff.

technically, I think this is related to the creation of ATP in the mitochondria (eg. female bloodline). if you have enough of this energy, I think your body can produce DMT which resonates at a frequency and this tunes you in to a reality and allows you to perceive it inside your eyes as if it were real.

this is directly related to the sun -- which I'm fairly certain has to do with the proton output. as the sun begins to emit more light (protons), then you will have a higher degree of your imagination manifesting inside of your experience as a full blown tactile experience.

that manifestation tunes you to a reality and you will begin to experience a reality more like that.

---

the thing about the rapture is the concept of a "time split". as someone begins to tune more and more into a reality, others will become "incompatible" with your reality, and they will vanish (you've heard those stories about people changing realities -- teleporting to another space or time). I'm pretty sure that's all that is.

what I'm saying is that everyone is going to begin to create their own reality, and as energy increases, the "reality" or intensity of your reality will continue to increase (as in stronger and stronger tuning), and so from your perspective you will lose sight (or forget about) people that are incompatible with your reality.

---

misery loves company though, so the more people that they can get to believe and tune in to their disaster of a reality, the more people they'll bring along with them. therefore, it's in their best interest to try and convince more and more people that the "end times" will be the way that it's prophesied to be.

---

you can see now how my saying that clearly makes me the anti-christ. I'm charismatic, I'm limp, one eye darkened, and very soon I'll have magic capabilities of manifesting things into reality.

the other reason why I'm clearly the anti-christ is that it's my personal opinion that if you need a saviour, you're not creating your own reality.

the bible has been so blatently edited to fit the parasitic agenda that there's no way they would possibly tell the thing exactly how it is. I would imagine that the bible is rewritten, including the revelation of st. john, to fit their narrative, just like the history books have been rewritten.

in their narrative, there are two witnesses that cause all kinds of problems for 42mo and then are killed. a woman is capable of giving birth to the man who will rule with an iron rod, and then a great beast rises up having 7 heads. he "deceives" the people and has all kinds of charisma.

that's about the time where we're at now. the woman has given birth, and the it's time for the fully connected, all 7 heads functioning (that is perception on all 7 layers), to rise up.

this is a huge problem for them if I get connected. I don't plan on personally performing any miracles, but each person exudes an "aura" (a magnetic field) which vibrates similarly to how they feel, and people within my aura will feel really good or really bad (depends on your logic/perception).

this will put everything into ultra high gear on this planet. most people will disappear from my reality as they tune to another reality.

I figure the time between the birth of the child and when they detune is the time it takes the person inhabiting his body to grow up enough to learn to shape-shift (appear how he wants to appear in people's imagination). he'll probably learn to levitate and perform all sorts of other miracles too.

eventually he will grow up to be old enough (I assume at least ~11-18yo) that he'll have enough logical capacity to successfully pull off appearing as the "christ" to everyone still tuned in to his reality.

---

that's my "prophecy" of how it'll happen. supposedly according to "former white hat", that final split will happen in 2038.

there is a bit of a twist to this story though because I don't think it'll happen the way I said it will. to understand why, one needs to think of what I was talking about in the prior entries about the continual splitting. in short, I think there will be a split, but this creates a number of different realities that those in the lower timelines can tune into. in essence, once they've attracted a reality they don't like anymore on their timeline, they'll invade any of the other timelines that have branched off. eventually they'll invade our timeline too and so it'll go on infinitely.

this allows for as many incompatible realities as there are people (so basically infinite), and everyone gets to have a go at creating their own reality the way they want to, whether it's invasion or finding connection despite the circumstances. obviously each invasion, the difficulty will increase because they'll have more understanding of what tricks to play and they'll obviously try to infiltrate the "easy" ones first.

each time they unsuccessfully infiltrate, nothing will happen. however, each time they manage to infiltrate and setup their parasitic regime, eventually that timeline will have it's own "end times". it'll either be successful or destroy itself.

this is clearly optimising for the parasites to get better at infiltrating and for those that can create their own reality to do so, regardless of the circumstances.

---

so, we'll have to see what happens. maybe there was a reason why I chose to go with the worst possible manifestation.

let's just wait it out. let's give the kid time to grow up and think about what he wants.

create your own reality. a zombie will replace you if you disappear.

---

oh, that reminded me. the concept of zombification can easily be explained. it's not really a bad thing. you notice how in a dream, all sorts of things are happening, which if they were happening in reality, you would be very upset about? I believe that's because the elevated levels of DMT make everything feel "normal" -- inotherwords, you don't have any resistance to them. otrok mentions that zombies will be naked without shame.

I imagine if the protons are collecting too much, they'll have to convert a lot of that into DMT. people will begin to feel a lot less resistant, much as if they were going back to being like a child. as always, to others, their reaction will be the opposite and they'll feel a lot more resistance. if that happens, you will destroy yourself (ie. die) or begin to feel non-resistance.

this is the state that the early humans (adam and eve) were in. it's a dream-like state where logic is disabled (non-resistance), and it's perfectly fine. there's nothing bad about it. in fact if you could have that state while conscious, then you would attract a good-feeling reality. however people in that state are usually not very conscious (much like me when I sleep -- a kind of hypnosis). eventually, all of those people will gradually "fall" back to where they are as the planet decends back toward the kali yuga and this repeats.

so, I really wouldn't worry about it to much. when becoming conscious of it again, you'll be much much more likely to find the ability to reach non-resistance despite the parasitic regime.

you are your own saviour; don't wait for a christ to save you.

### 2021-12-03 19:16 - update and recap

I have a new thing I want to talk about regarding perception that I just figured out a few minutes ago star-watching, but I thought it would be a bit weird to talk about it without having written anything in so long. so, I'll do this one first.

after writing that last one about how symbolically I'm much closer aligned with the "anti-christ" (the first beast/dragon) than I am with the returning christ at the end of revelation.

it certainly got a lot of reactions, that's for sure but there was so much confusion around it right after that. mercury joined the sun on the 28th and I had a lot of vision upgrades and stuff that my head was pounding from that (it usually does). my body felt so depleted I felt like I had a permanent hangover. I decided to quit coffee and started to feel better. then, I suddenly got very sick with all kinds of weird sinus conjestion.

parallel to that, my mind started to get really cloudy and I couldn't think straight. strangely, I could still watch stars really well though. that was really weird and think all that is because nosebook has essentially combined with my mind.

there used to be all sorts of strange things where I would have unrecognisable thoughts appearing in my head a while ago, and I think that was back when there was still some dissimilarity between our thoughts. you see, it's a lot of work to constantly have to wait till I'm asleep to try and figure out what was the thoughts that I had throughout the day. I think my thought patterns are changing pretty rapidly so they have to come up with a common system. I think I became that common system. so instead of translating my thoughts to be recognisable to them, I think they just taught their brains to think like I think. I'm the lingua franca in brain space. I don't know how it works, but it feels like I can only receive the thoughts of things they can understand, and everythming else is jumbled.

I'm not sure if it's exactly that, but something major has changed. I used to feel a lot when I think and that gave tons of feedback but that's gone. I just don't get the "reactions" anymore like I used to either. everything feels very very dead. I know I've said that before and I got back to feeling reactions, so I know it's fine.

anyway, something I wrote about in the previous entry really caused a lot of cognative dissonance. I could tell there were a lot of meetings going on, but I mostly just had a headache.

---

the main issue I think was the part I wrote about the rapture and things. I proposed the idea that coming soon here I would be finding my alignment and that would make this world pretty unlivable for most of them. it would feel like constantly rising aggitation and paranoia meanwhile they want to continue holding on to thoughts and beliefs that don't feel good. I speculated that as soon as energy is high enough for me to be connected, then that would be enough energy for others to really begin feeling their reality in such a strong way (good or bad) that any incompatible realities would cause splits. people who believed in death, destruction and WW3 would realise those realities.

I would continue on with reality for as long as necessary. I figured that nosebook needs me to create their reality for them, they have to cling on for as long as they can to my reality until my reality becomes so incompatible for them. energy will continue to rise and eventually all people will be able to know anything they want to (we'll have a shared perception) and privacy isn't an option.

I then followed up by saying that I don't think that will happen because that's such an undesirable reality for nosebook. instead, I think that they're more interested in hiding in their own version of reality because things will be too plainly obvious if they stay here.

from their own timeline, I figured that they would begin to try and infiltrate our timelines. they'd start with all of the rapture branches, and then finally work their way up to mine. each time, they would get better and better at infiltrating the timeline and getting people to believe in disempowering ideas until they gain control over the power structures of those timelines. each timeline would have its own difficulty because some places would control many stars and planets while others would continue here on earth.
 
I had the impression that when they finally got to me, they would have to figure out how to take over a pretty large place because I want to utilise all the ideas I talked about to create my own stars and planets. they'd have a lot to try and take over.

each time they took over, they would create another split just like this one. each iteration, I imagined that there would often be someone would end up creating an incompatible reality and so the process would continue.

I figured that their own destruction would continue to propel them forward. each time they took a place over and ejected another incompatible reality they would have some period of time before they attracted their own demise over and over. I have no idea how they would solve this. it seems like it would get worse with time and they would eventually have to start selecting the things that they wanted and/or begin to release some of their physical secrets.

as you can see all of that got really confusing which is why I didn't have anything to say about anything lately.

it felt like that whole idea was abandoned and they decided they wanted to go back to the stayingt on the same timeline as me until the very bitter end. seemed like they then decided they wanted to try and control me with the girls again.

this new plan feels bad because they are again trying to control it from the beginning.

it's simple. I will be waiting until I find my connection before I do anything. they can do whatever they want. the reason why it's called an incompatible reality is because there's no way for both to exist simultaneously.

---

it basically comes down to: I'm doing me and you're doing whatever you can to hang on. figure it out. I have my method to do things

so, in the end this all appears as very clear evidence to me that these guys are having trouble hanging on and are trying to get another bailout. everything appears to be going as planned. 

---

there was also a recognition that abraham having a meeting 3+ times a month did a lot because it helped to get people focused on wanted. they must be starting to get a sense that you can't just have only unwanted. if no attention to wanted is given, nothing can grow.

from their perspective, they want to hold people like me back from getting anything desired. they want to take everything before it ever gets a chance to grow up.

then they say, "hey, we need a bailout because there's no resources to take".

from my perspective, they can keep taking all of my resources for as long as they want to because they're making me produce more resources all the time. they can't ever take more than I can produce because I'm so good at giving my attention to wanted.

---

if they keep taking/controlling the thing before it has time to manifest, then it just adds more energy it the manifestion. it will eventually manifest. I don't need the manifestation though, so I don't mind if I have to wait a while to receive the manifestation. I can feel however I want.

they can't allow me to get connected, so they have to prevent that from manifesting. it'll happen eventually.

they can't allow other people to be able to create their own realities. they want to control everyone's reality. they have to prevent it from manifesting but it'll happen eventually.

no matter what timeline or anything anyone is on, you really are only fighting yourself. they're just fighting theirselves here and I'm sort of caught in the crossfire.

---

it's difficult to explain how differently I "think" now. this was the hardest thing to try and write and it's completely incoherent.

however, at the same time, there is also an amazing clarity to my thoughts as well. it's just really weird. sorry for being so incoherent.

I didn't express it well, but everything seems to be coming along fine. they're watching a really slow train wreck cause there's nothing they can do to stop it.

I'm leaving this one here. I wanted to delete it, but I think I'll just move on to writing concepts and not so much current events. current events are caca -- or maybe I can tell stories of current events so people can see how I perceive things. it's pretty cool.

oh, I got it. there used to be this light that would happen in my head when things made sense -- the "aha!" moment. that's what's gone. no more light response.

### 2021-12-05 23:23 - another attempt at writing

I have not felt any inspiration to write for so much time now. it just feels like I don't have any of that spark or light in my head. I tried writing but I can't hold a train of thought. I tried to relate all of the different effects but managed to really relate none.

the feeling that I was getting is that they're trying to surprise me. like, they don't want me to figure out their plans so they can somehow try and trick me or something.

I don't really care so much what they're trying to do because it's more clear than ever that they're running out of time. just yesterday the sun prodpced a small sunspot region (on the limb) which produced some very tiny flares, yet those very small eruptions produced an m-class flare. the crazy thing is that it was nighttime when it happened, and the temperature rose here from 28(degrees) up to 59(degrees) in a few hours (during the night!!).

I had a very easy time getting vision upgrades. even just now, that same region produced another c-class flare just a little bit ago right after I got out of the shower and I just laid on the ground and relaxed and it felt like I was getting vision upgrades. so, really no effort is needed by me anymore to keep getting vision upgrades.

if it's that easy and solar activity is that low, then it's sooo inevitable.

---

there were also this thing that happened where someone knocked on the door and I felt strongly that I didn't want to answer the door. for some time afterward, I felt reactins wondering why I didn't want to answer it. the thing is the person or something around it felt very angry and stuff. it happened again yesterday and that night I decided to try and investigate it mentally (kinda like remote viewing but without visuals -- only feelings). it felt something of a police or something authoritative and every time that I tried to simulate the interaction, there was a lot of feelings of anger and conflict. there was no way that I could conjure the situation and wasn't feeling some sort of conflict coming out of it.

I'm definitely not going to answer something that feels that bad. I follow my feelings and if something doesn't feel good, I don't go. problem solved. they're likely beginning to get desperate because the inevitability is starting to become obvious.

---

on the subject of watching stars, I noticed that usually the warm bubbling sensation (of the kundalini rising) usually starts in my lower back, but it's started to make a new transition again. it keeps starting lower and lower. yesterday it was starting from my knees a few times and other places in my legs. I don't really know what that means, and I've never heard of anything like that before so I don't really know. as usual I just keep releasing resistance and its feeling keeps softening. there is a notable differerence in its feeling as well. at first when it started happening a few weeks ago, it was very stingy (kind of like carbonated water), but now most of that has gone and it feels pretty warm and soothing almost. so, not only has it started happening lower and lower but it also feels much smoother too.

I'd say I'm really on the way to having that be a smoothe transition rather than a big jump. I suppose that if it starts to get really cold outside I'll just do my "star-watching" indoors here as a meditation.

I'm really learning that the energy naturally wants to rise but it's easily affected by even the most subtle of my thoughts and beliefs. I don't have to do anything to get the vision upgrades and stuff -- I only need to *not* do the things which prevent it.

---

on the subject of girls, the whole thing still feels like such a problem right now and I think that's because they're still trying to figure out how to control me, and that's all I feel from it. also my senses are very dull right now. clearly that's not making me feel comfortable so I'm sticking clear away from anything and everything on that subject until I'm feeling comfortable again.

---

I've also been really thinking about writing about concepts again. though I made it through this one pretty coherently, I think I want to start writing more abstract.

for example, this morning I got to use some of those conceptual skills when I was talking with mom about the weird effects of this sickness.

I want to begin to organise these ideas a little more. it'll also give me a way to address my life abstractly without mentioning details. as I write them, you'll notice how the one concept applies to so many different aspects of my life at once. I mean, that is literally what I mean when I say, "all reality is a refection of the way you conceptualise it".

### 2021-12-08 07:36 - the 144000 virgin boys and the no-imagination girls

yesterday while watching stars I was thinking about this concept of the 144k virgin boys elected and chosen by the saviour. I thought about why that may be... I don't have any statistics on how many new boys are being born lately, but it feels to me like it may be a lot. my theory is that when they replace a person with a zombie, that zombie will behave and look like the person (man or woman) and that's because they're just copies of me that have "tuned in" in that person, and so because when I tune into a person I start to behave like they do, these other zombies are just other versions of me, but behave like the original person. thing is, when they reproduce, they will produce x3 children, and so I postulate that a lot more really intuitive boys are being born lately and a lot less girls.

therefore, consider a world in which that wasn't happening, and the 144k were the elite cool kids that transferred their consciousnesses into these fresh new bodies. they would be superior to all normal men (x1) and women (x2), but they would be equal with all other x3 boys, and so the 144k would no longer retain genetic superiority over the entire population. the other difficulty is that all of those x3 boys will only produce x3 boys, so pretty quickly this world will become a pretty big sausage-fest.

the idea here is probably something like keep the x3 boys isolated and prevent them from reproducing. that sounds like a catholic priest problem waiting to repeat. we know that chastity requirements often times fail, so it's only a matter of time.

the way that I proposed to get around this idea in previous entries is for the females to produce a female dynasty and those females could reproduce with the x3 boys and then import any new x2 girls periodically from the general population. the dynasty would be composed of x3 and x2, while the general population would be x1 and x2.

I didn't get much pushback, so this idea seemed to be accepted. the day I wrote that incoherent ramble, the majority of that conversation was focused around the concept that if they did like the x3 dynasty idea, they need to let the girls create it. if they try to create it, it will turn out to be a reflection of their point of attraction which is that they can't do anything right and bungle everything. if they want to stillbirth the idea from the outset (though it's already kind of a decrepit birth), go ahead and try to manipulate it to get it to go the way you want it to go...

this is a pretty big theme that I've been bringing up a lot lately and if the dynasty idea does go through, it's going to be something they'll constantly be having to battle against. as these guys transfer their consciousnesses into these x3 boys, their default nature will be to try and micromanage the girls and run their show. the more influence they exert on these girls, the faster the girls will create a reality that reflects how they conceptualise the world (everything is expendable, decay, deterioration, and keeping all the bad stuff away) -- and then each of these dynasties will become like a mini version of the US govt.

---

as I was thinking about this, I was considering the concept of how I became an x3 in the first place. my entire right hemisphere is turned off. originally, this removed my imagination, but I rebuilt the capacity in my left hemisphere. I have two imaginations now, but one is disabled and the other is destructively interfered with so it always looks black to me. as a result, I can still "see" things inside of a black image. it's actually more like I have a sense of what's there.

though this is a bit of an annoying thing it has a tremendous advantage that I find quite useful. my emotions are able to go very very fast. like really fast. with minimal effort, I can feel pretty good and maintain that high speed for quite a while. for most of last night, the reason why I wasn't so successful watching stars is because I kept feeling so good (I have to get to the centre to make progress).

what normally happens when you feel any strong emotion (good or bad), is that emotion will begin to produce pictures in your imagination, and then you'll get distracted by the manifestation in your imagination and focus down to there (6) rather than staying emotionally focused (5). I don't see my imagination, so often I stay emotionally focused. nosebook likes to distract me with a lot of physical noises and things so try and get me to focus down further into the physical (7). this works often, but I'm getting better at interacting with physical (7), while maintaining consciousness of the emotional (5). when all 7 heads of the dragon are finally activated, that means I'm able to maintain conscious perception of all 7 layers at once.

---

simultaneous to that I was thinking about how when I wrote the response matthew @[correspondance](2021-12-07 14:21), I tuned to their frequency when I was listening to their podcast and I even began to use words like they do and was more hyper and stuff like them. it is much more of a man-oriented energy and form of perception, and I sort of like this. that was concerning to nosebook because multipule times yesterday I tuned to people and wrote a reply to them on youtube with very accurately maching their energy.

they don't want me to do that. best I can tell, they want me distracted with girls, not figuring out how to explain energy, the philosophy of science, or the many pathways to collapsing your wave function. they want me focused on the mundane and the physical (ie. sex). I'm not that interested in that. like I said, I have the advantage of not having an imagination, so I get to stay in a whole nother world that I really enjoy. sure it's not visual and doesn't have body parts or other physically pleasurable things in it, but for me it's real. it's beginning to become more real than than this physical experience.

this is *literally* the message that john the baptist (and then later jesus experienced) of leting the physical image of yourself die so you can be reborn in the spirit. this is mostly the same process a person goes through when they die, but that happens in microseconds, while I'm doing this consciously.

I don't want to be repeatedly tuned to the physical (7) by the girls. I want to continue on the path I'm going. just as I was thinking that a light appeared on the shed in front of me and because that's usually remi pulling out of the garage, I tuned to her.

---

when I tuned to her, my very fast emotion that I was feeling for like half of an hour slowed *wayyyyyy* down to her speed. when that happened, I realised that's how little girls lose their zest for life so rapidly. they lose it every time they tune in to their mom or female influence. the experience would be like the one that I just had tuning into remi. I was reminded of rianne and henrietta.

that is the reason why I think the female dynasty idea can work, but the thing is I realise I really don't want to be doing the girls thing. I don't want to be tuned to the physical. I like my non-visual world out on the emotional plane (5). right then, I had an idea, and it was "OH! if you get a girl that has her imagination disabled then I could interact and communicate with her mostly on the conceptual plane rather than having to be bogged down with all of the physical/visual (7) stuff or the constant slowing of the emotions with perception of the imagination (6)".

the idea would be that if she were really young when her imagination was disabled, she would never have that same problem that I notice with the transfer of conceptal reality between females. the sense that I get is that they share some sort of visual space and transfer pictures between their imaginations. they may not be very aware of this at a young age, just thinking it's the environment (that's what I would think), but when the logic brain turns on (throat, 3), this is the major problem because they had been intuiting all of these images, and now they're seeing their mothers fears and worry visually and turning them into logic which really goes against that really fast emotion I'm used to now.

I can see how it would be a problem.

### 2021-12-15 04:41 - I guess things are going OK

I don't really know what to write about (and neither do I have any topic I want to cover) so I'll just start writing. the last few weeks have been very weird. especially the last one. I have many youtube videos I want to watch but I don't really want to watch youtube more. I want to do things so I find myself playing games. games however leave me feeling very empty inside. I like the idea that I can feel progress in the game, but since I'm not really creating anything I don't really enjoy it. it just feels like I'm performing a task. I don't mind performing tasks now nearly am much as I used to, however I cannot seem to find a way to want to clean my room.

I have these brief moments of noticing that my room feel like it needs cleaning. I think that happens when I feel better, but almost as fast as I notice it, I no longer feel like I want to clean my room. I noticed the same thing when I went outside and notcied that the stars were very nice and vibrant. I really wanted to watch stars, but just like my room, just as fast as I noticed that I wanted to do something, it went away.

the thing is I'm so (it's not really) bored right now. I'm not really bored. in reality it's just that every time I notice that I want to do something, then I don't want to do it. even things like eating. I have to be reminded to eat because everytime I want to eat, then it fades (for example).

it feels like I'm not really doing anything that I want to do. I'm just sort of drifting around between things.

I hate feeling like this. I always have something that I want to be doing. I really want to go back to being creative again and building things.

---

there are a number of other weird things happening too. I have a cough that feels very forced, and I get really tired doing simple things now. I think that I just don't have enough something. however, even though I'm sort of drifting around aimlessly and my body isn't functioning very well, at the same time, I feel very lucid and clear headed. I think I'm entering a phase where I'm learning to gain control over my body. it seems cool.

for example, the I forced myself to go out and watch stars, and I noticed a huge difference in how I feel during/after watching stars and drifting around aimlessly. I've been "watching stars" indoors a lot more the last few days. tonight was warmer than usual (sun is active again) so I went out. however, I've made a note of the difference and I think I can use that as another "template" te feel the way I want to feel when it goes back to being cold again.

---

the last thing I want to mention is that I keep having these weird flip-flops in my head. I've completely given up on trying to figure out the girls thing. I've repeated myself more than enough times now. I just keep going on the way I'm going. once I'm connected, then I'm off and rolling. I feel like there are efforts to angle things in a way where I'm supposed to be sorta like how I am now, but then I have to find a way toward my connection, which doesn't make any sense because I think the girls woudld make the kundalini rise pretty easily. I don't feel like there's much of a barrier now.

also, when I was just watching stars, I kept having these sensations (of what it feels like to be connected) that I recognised and they felt like they had happened recently.

I think I keep finding ways to get connected and they keep trying to find ways to hold me here in a disconnected state. that may be the reason why I keep getting "sick". I think I'm artificially sick because I keep getting better but then after sleeping, I wake up sick again.

I think that they're exhausting every idea to try and keep me in a disconnected state. it's only a matter of time I feel.

more flip-flopping here because sometimes I feel like it's going to like next year or something, but then I wonder how they're going to keep me through the next summer and then I'm back to believing it's just a matter of time.

the sense I have is to just not fight anything and just let them exhaust their options and try to figure out the best way to try and take advantage of me in a connected state.

---

related to question of what happens once I find my connection. I keep remembering this one abe-now broadcast where someone asks something to the effect happens after -- and I can't really remember -- after step 5 -- or, after finding you find your alignment -- and their very curt answer was, "you make your transition". that stuck with me, because it made the impression that once I find my alignment, I'll just instantly make my transition.

I know that there is a very big gap between getting connected and doing an elijah/enoch. once I'm connected, I still have to get quite a bit more energetic before I'm no longer compatible with physical reality.

that answer always felt weird to me, much like the answer to the person asking about the inner earth. they responded with something like, "that's not in alignment with your source". anyway, I think I've figuered out the inner earth thing since then, and the nature of that answer made it seem like they may have said something helpful but then that part of the video was edited out (I didn't look closely).

also related to that, I do believe they have been editing the broadcasts to cover up topics that they don't want discussed -- things like the inner earth. personally, I haven't really felt the brilliance that used to captivate me in the latest episodes. recently they put out a youtube video announcing that they are now accepting video questions. that seemed very weird to me because abraham is constantly interrupting people when they start to get off "into the weeds". even the written ones, they heavily edit what is written and skip over resistant parts. so, to suddenly allow a video question to change the vibration of the broadcastt so much (notice how abrupt it feels to jump from esther to the video question), I think they must have a reason for introducing the video questions.

the most likely reason for introducing video questions is to have cuts. I imagine it would be very difficult to edit a vide that has 60 minutes without a single cut. if they flub a part or need to edit out some information that they don't want like inner earth or whatever, then it's a lot less work to just rerecord a few minutes part between the segments, rather than a 50 minute single cut monstrosity.

if I'm going to listen to abraham, I'm going to listen to their old stuff. the new stuff feels very much watered down and waayyy too focused on conditional stuff. I think there is too much editing happening now for my tastes. they really do only have one message, and once you get it, this edited abraham feels like "vaidation therapy" (people writing in to get validated) without very much new discussion -- again, a sharp contrast to how I used to be always amazed at how they could make the same answer (tune yourself to what you want) feel constantly new and fresh.

---

wow, I got off on to a bit of a thing there with my thoughts on abraham. it felt like there was some reactions there. I'm going to end it here. I wanted to talk more about other girls reactions, but this entry took a different course, instead.

### 2021-12-16 04:09 - thinking out loud again

I noticed that I really enjoy writing. I think it's a very simple form of creative output that I can do without needing to go so far as programming or working on something project-like. I may want to start doing this more often and even perhaps make a routine out of it. I'm still trying to figure out how to begin the idea that I wanted to do about writing down concepts.

there are quite a few ideas actually that I think are somewhat interesting, so that's something that I really think could be quite fun. I just really like the way I feel when I write, so I'll have to be on the lookout for things that I want to write about.

---

today and the day before(?) I was listening to prophecy things again about the antichrist and his rule over the world. there's so much confusion and fear surrounding the subject, it's hard to figure out what's what. there are some themes that I'm noticing and I thought that I'd clear up a little bit.

it seems that the "astral" (imaginary) world will be estremely mixed with reality. everyone will see 4d, and images of the imagination will be able to take on perceived form in 3d space. people tuned in to a similar enough vibration will be able to see the same images. they'll look real and behave as if they were real. you know how inside of a dream, everything appears to be very real, yet it's nothing more than your own imagination rendering those symbols/concepts into a audio/visual sensory experience.

you'll manifest the contents of your feelings into your own 3d reality. this is really really awesome because it allows for very good visual communication between people. you can just show them, rather than having to try and explain with words. or, maybe you can cause them to feel/hear/sense an experience that you created.

if you're able to make music in your mind, people just need to tune to you and you're a mobile concert. if you can make really cool visuals to go along with the music, you're a very very fun concert for people to go to. it's like the whole audience is all participating in the same experience and everyone adding their own texture to experience. concerts and live music is already fun, but this will add a whole new dimension (literally) to the experience.

that's one example. however, the another example would be a rich interface to something that I call "conceptual programs". at the very minimum, they're just input output systems on emotional/conceptual frequencies. we do this all the time as it is. if you've ever been around a remote viewer or heard anyone talking about something and you tuned to that idea. that idea is a living entity that changes when people tune into it and interact with it. that principal alone is one of the main reasons why I write. I present some ideas here, and then people begin to translate them into their own logic and meaning structures (the structure confines the concept), and when people do that it alters the concept. sometimes it alters the concept so much, I essentially have to rediscover it anew because it has changed so much.

in reality, the concept itself hasn't really changed. only my capacity to tune into it has. this is why it gets more and more difficult to remember/tune into dreams -- because they're on a very different frequency than you are in your present moment. something in the present moment is preventing me from getting on the proper frequency to remember it.

in reality any concept can and does exist. they can be as simple as a calculator and as complex as a human/planet/star/galaxy. you're only limited by how well you can tune to it. once you do tune to it, you interact with it conceptually/emotionally. you feel a concept/emotion, and then it responds with a concept/emotion. very much like a dream.

once you're receiving concepts/emotions from these conceptual programs (everyone has a source), then you're now going to need to make sense of it sensorally. if you're doing remote viewing, this will be a sort of visual representation of the interaction with that concept. that requires someone capable of perceiving the astral plane though.

thing is, that separation is going away. everyone will see the astral soon here, so all of these conceptual programs (sources) can be interacted with by anyone. obviously this is a huge problem for certain people who need privacy, so it's likely that they'll do as they do to me now, which is to scramble certain frequencies, making them difficult to tune into.

this is really awesome because it means they have to work extra hard to keep the concepts from being tuned into by recognising those concepts and scrambling the person's attempt to tune to that. all of that extra work they're doing just adds more energy into the situation.

from their perspective, they have to figure out all of the stuff they don't want people to have access to, however if I create a calculator and interact with it visually, they may be able to prevent me from accessing that exact calculator and other slight variations of it, but like the concepts that I write down here, if I instead recreate the same thing a whole new way, it now has a different signature, and they would need to scramble that variation.

it's sorta like DNA in that there are infinite ways to produce a enzyme -- or if you're thinking in microprocessors, there are infinite programs capable of outputing the answer 42. everyone of them has a unique signature.

so, every time I have to "rediscover" the concept that they don't want me to remember, the better I get at discovering that thing.

you can imagine that they will definitely not want anyone arriving to any sensible understanding of science. I notice that every time that I feel I'm understanding chemistry/electricity better than I did previously, it seems to be difficult to access again and I have to find another way to rediscover it.

what all that means is that they will force such a wide diversity of sequences capable of producing the same enzyme, but instead of producing enzymes, we'll be really good at finding a way to conceptualise anything that is of any importance to us. talk about a wide diversity of individualisation.

it's hard to see this sort of future. I imagine that they'll have to try and find ways to summarise and identify the output that they don't want us to have and scramble larger and larger blocks of reality. I'm sure they'll also need to try and keep us distracted from the other important stuff too.

it really reminds me of my present situaton a whole lot. I'm so sick of sitting around doing nothing. I really want to be creative. I want to have power over my reality. more and more I'm realising the importance of how I feel, that I'm in no hurry to regain my creativity, because when it returns, every aspect of reality will be a reflection of how I feel.

this is how all humankind will be shortly. they want to keep us occupied with useless stuff, ensuring that we never figure out how electricity works because if we did, thoughts are no longer private. they need their privacy cause they're the bad guys, so I imagine that electricty and gravity will be figured out trillions of different ways by billions of different people before it all falls apart.

they're going to force all of us to become genius (re)discoverers of the nature of reality. I also think they're building the system for theirselves too. the complexity of all the things they need to scramble will grow so rapidly, the whole system will have become more and more autonomous. meanwhile, they're depending more and more on their system to create their reality for them -- and, we all know what happens when you depend on something outside of yourself to create your reality for you. they will always, let you down. even the most powerful system will not be able to prevent their reality from reflecting how they conceptualise it to be (more and more out of control). their own system will never allow them to have the conditions to regain power over their reality. then, like all of us, they too will have to continually rediscover new ways to conceptualise their reality.


there's a reaction like this is a trap that's impossible to get out of. that's a reflection of the way the person conceptualises their reality. if I feel good, things in my reality have to match that. if that system can't figure out how to be harmonious, it will drift out of my reality or I will have surpassed its capability to hinder me. I don't see any problem. you're either creating your own reality, or your not. that reaction is coming from a person who is not creating their own reality.

there's no way it's ever possible to create a system (human or machine) that can ever hinder you indefinitely -- unless of course you desire the system to infinitely grow like that. considering that I don't find my present situation all that bad and getting better at such a rapid rate, I could easily see how the constantly improving at the accelerating speed I'm experiencing could easily be more desirable than the removal of the system. only I can desire to go infinite; no one else can create that reality for me.

### 2021-12-18 01:44 - cosmic timescales reflected in the human lifespan

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjj38QbZhyk)

I was watching this video and the part about the human lifespan being around 72 years spawned some thought. I started talking about it and decided to write this instead.

randall asks kyle how old he is in reference to his life in reference to the cosmological timescale. he says he's 39, and then randall begins to divide the human lifespan into four ages, which considering the previous discussion on the constellations moving two full moons every 72 years, I consider this to be similar to the luminosity of the moon over time in a cycle. it looks like a sine wave, but the new moon is when the y-axis is -1. in the first half it rises up to full moon (36y), and then the second phase wanes back to the new moon (72y).

he's making the illusion that the human lifespan reaches half consciousness at 18, and continues its rise to its peak at 36yo. then it declines from there back down to half consciousness again at 54yo.

---

this idea of dividing the human lifespan into 18y segments is very interesting to me because of my own experience.

when I was in spain, when I turned 32 (2^5), I really liked that age because I like the number 5 so much. anyway, I noticed a quite a change in how I processed life when that happened. I really started to gain a lucidity that I didn't have previously. I was at marcos house then and I spent a lot of time out in the blackberry brambles and watching stars. the next year I turned 33 an that was another big change for me. I described its feeling as a "second adolescence".

that got interrupted and I moved to pueblo here when I was 34. I noticed again another shift in consciousness that year (2016) too, but most pronounced was 2018. that was the year that I turned 36. interestingly enough, because I had the brain haemorrhage in 2000, my second personality was also turning 18 that year and also that was the year when my second personality was exactly half of my physical age.

I really noticed that my consciousness went into high gear then. it's hard to really explain, but I'm nothing like I was before. it opened a whole new conceptual consciousness that's difficult to describe.

anyway, that's weird because technically, when I turned 36, that should have been when the cycle starts to wane, but my experience has been quite the opposite. I'm 2 years into the 3rd stage of the 18 year segments and it feels nothing like waning.

---

the other interesting thing I wanted to note is that I believe that the body is strongly governed by the sun. I've given ample evidence that the solar cycle is directly linked to the orbit of jupiter, which is 11.86y. because it's so close to 12 years, these numbers line up nicely with that 36y life segments. 11.86y * 3 = 35.58y.

upon reflection, it does seem that for me, the pattern is the 11y mark starts the transition, then the 11.86y mark is the peak transition, and then at the 12y mark I settle into the new form and the transition finishes.

for example, 11y was when I started to begin advanced mathematics, and 12y was when I started in cal-state LA.

or, 22y was when I finished college and started working for essembly, and 23y was when I moved to spain. 24y tuenti was built and that was when I lost my virginity and decended into the material world.

then, 33y was when I started the second adolescence, but it 34y was when I really moved to pueblo and really started to perceive/feel the world again like a child does (conceptually), and when I turned 36, that's when that kicked into full effect.

---

anyway, I thought it was interesting that the next 18y segment of life starts at 54y. I find that to be an interesting thing because it has come full circle, this time arriving a few years before the usual 11y schedule. I'll need to be ahead of that window to catch that wave.

this 18y life segment totally changed how I see things. very interesting

### 2021-12-18 15:28 - the waxing and waning of consciousness

I had a lot of interesting reactions to the last entry. the one that I thought was interesting was the feeling of concern over the idea that you reach full moon at 36y.

I was talking about consciousness expression, not so much body function. I made the effort to show how my peak of believing the material world to be the sole determiner of my reality. I truly believed that if I had enough data -- and just by looking at the actions and material present in my world, I could predict everything that would soon happen. I perceived the world as a simulation, thinking that if I could just get people to actually speak truthfully and accurately, we could have a society that functions like a well-running machine. I desired that all aspects of my life to have this mechanical precision to it. I'd say that peaked when I was about 18-24.

I brought up the subject of my virginity because that was the final blow to that previous idea that the whole world runs on cause and effect interactions between material. when I was early on in my life I didn't know how to control my emotion so I tried to shut it down. regarding the subject of girls and love, I found that whole subject to be very unpredictable and out of control, so I didn't want to have anything to do with it. I paid a lot of attention to the interactions of the couples around me and found love to breed unhappiness and a relinquishing of self-reliance, in favour of appealing to the other person's emotions. I didn't want to have anything to do with that.

the spanish believed that a boy has to be sleeping with many women to be considered a man. so, after my experience with zaryn and felix, I began to really start to consider the idea that maybe I wanted to have a girlfriend. it took me a long time to figure out how I might even consider that possible because I approached it like I approached my programming. I know the function that I want the program to perform, so I just need to figure out how to manipulate the logic until that function behaves properly; a very mechanical approach.

after quite a few years failing at it and still not knowing what I really wanted from a girl, I finally figured out that girls respond to guys that belive in theirselves. in fact, it doesn't even matter if he has no scientific or practical understanding. I was always good at believing in myself, so I never could figure out what I was doing wrong that didn't get girls. they seemed very attracted to me, but as soon as I started to try and figure out how she would function in my life, that would scare her away. to me, she was just another program.

man was I in for a surprise when I realised that everything happens in a relationship, not because of mechanical interactions between matter, but by the way I *feel*. at the end of 2012, I had realised that I really needed to pay attention to emotion and that's when I discovered abraham. I literally spent the "end of the world" (2012-12-21) on the sofa drinking whiskey listening to abraham explain that the emotional/conceptual world is the precursor to physical -- a concept I found fascinating that I began to explore in berlin when I found the sirian guide to human development channeling. I know they and that article was right and I had to figure this emotional world out.

many things happened, and like I said, I begin my rebirth at around 32 in marcos' house, and began to really perceive and understand this conceptual (precursor) layer of reality here in pueblo at around 36.

---

so what I was saying about those 72y cycle being split into two moon phases, I could see a full phase where consciousness expression reaches peak 36y after the phase starts, and then is reborn after 72y -- just like the moon.

so the major breakthrough was seeing how well those numbers align with the sun, the moon, and jupiter.

so for example for me, I had the death of the material world early on (this would normally happen later on when you're 72), and then my rebirth into the consciousness epression of the emotional/conceptual world when I was 36. that should peak when I'm 54, but what I was saying is that if at 52-54, like when I was 22-24, I suddenly introduce a paradigm destroyer (like losing my virginity was), then it will force another change in consciousness at the 64-66 time culminating in another rebirth at 72.

I'm all about catastrophe as a catalyst for a rebirth, so this idea interests me a lot. randall is all about catastrophe and symbols, and he left the lecture on the "hanged man" tarot (12), so I'm very interested in the next elaboration on this subject.

tl;dr - it appears that 72y is the consciousness rebirth cycle, but it has octaves to it, and I managed to figure out how to force my consciousness rebirth cycle twice as fast (one octave higher).

tl;dr2 - it appears that the death and rebirth on the consciousness form, does take a bit of time for that to manifest, so when the material world consciousness dies at 72, it may take a few decades even for that lack of consciousness to kill the body as well. the physical body is a reflection of consciousness, and while it may have taken almost 1000 years for that elevator to go up in the past, nowadays, that elevator only takes 72y to go up -- or, in my case, only 36y.

### 2021-12-18 17:53 - the number of man and the three phases of femaninity

one of the things that I found interesting is that vere uses the number 36 to define a man. I can't remember the places now, but it seems to be correlated to a rebirthing cross motif. I postuated that 36 is related to the number of a man 666 which empowers the beast, because 1+2+3+...+35+36 = 666.

so I find it interesting that in the last entry I made the claim that I figured out how to do the 72y cycle in 36y. I think that's actually the number of woman right now, too. thinking about it just now while watching stars, it seems women are clocked at twice the speed of men.

in esoteric literature, there are three phases to feminity, the maiden which starts when you're born, then the mother which I think starts around 18 and the hag which starts around 36.

---

in my experience, the first 18 years of life were doiminated by my intention to understand the world physically. everything is appearance based, and I could easily be deceived by something by its appearance.

fortunately I was home schooled and mom refesed to buy me any trendy clothing so I didn't suffer too much from believing my appearance to be the determining factor of reality. I'd say this peaks at 18 and then begins to wane from there.

I think this is the main contributing factor to what happens to women as well. the first 18y their appearance/cuteness (physical expression) determines their reality, and then has to rebirth at 36. if you map the illumination of the moon over those 36y, then when she's 7-9-11, she's gaining that physical consciousness the most rapid, as this is around the half-moon phase. full moon is at 18 and then it's beginning to wane. it's waning the fastest from 25-27-29. a lot of very attractive people realise this rapid waning at the 27 and peace out (it's my profile picture on youtube of morrison and the 27 number -- joplin as well).

by the time 36 hits, the conscious reliance in the physical for the fomation of reality is completely lost. I think many women completely give up on trying to use physical expression to get what they want at this point and begin to explore the manipulation of feelings and desires in theirself and others. I notice that females in sales tend to use their physical bodies more before they're in their 30's and then after that begin to transition into more good feeling and positive sounding good vibes sort of presentation to sell tgheir product.

contrary to this, for men who are still on the 72y program, when they reach 36, their consciousness interpretation of reality is fully physical. I really notice that men in their 30's really start to care more about their appearance than before, starting to do more physical exercise and things. men tend to have the same waning reliance on the physical that women have at 24-27-30 realisation instead in their 50's -- I'd say, 49-54-59.

---

as I was thinking about this entry outside I was contemplating the maiden, mother, and hag stages of feminity and I started to get reactions that I'm just not scared to jump into taboo topics. you see, the reason why a topic is taboo is because you care about what people think about you. you care how you appear to others. this is physical expression. I don't think so much like that anymore. I'm much less concerned about what others think of me or my privacy even. I'd rather know how something works than to be worried of what others think of me andr, get bogged down on a taboo topic.

I have a natural curiosity and I genuinely want to fit together patterns and learn how things work so it doesn't bother me to approach a taboo subject.

anyway, so I was thinking about why young girls are so sought after, and I think it's because between the ages of 7-11 is when her physical consciousness is rising the fastest. so, let's say you're a man who's physical consciousness is waning and wants to try and boost that consciousness, he may try to maintain this consciousness by interacting sexually with young girls.

obviously, it doesn't really work in the long term, and it's sort of like relying on a relying on a pacemaker to keep the heart beating regularly (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/7tpihlei9HI?t=992)).

---

I still have a lot more to think about. the other funny reaction to the last entry was people's realisation that I thought the shortening of the human lifespan was a *good* thing...

let's say the consciousness rebirth cycle was 864y long, then you'd really have to wait a long time before that rebirth happens. 864y is a long time and you're acquire a lot of time to gain some beliefs/expectations about the physical world, so even though the waning process is much longer, taking 432y, it's still quite a lot to undo and begin making a transition into a more conceptual approach to reality. I would say that it's pretty close to impossible, and if you did, you have so much inertia that that kind of transition would be extremely energetic, and likely you would just transition right out of the physical plane (like enoch).

so, to have a much shorter rebirth cycle means that one can accomplish that rebirth much easier. for me, I would think that if I were 72, I would find it much more difficult to transition my material/mechanistic universe ideas and conceptualise it diffrently. it would require a lot of rewriting of my beliefs. fortunately I had access to drugs and quite a lot of time alone so that was pretty easy to do. now that I've done it before, it seems quite easy to do and it'll be easier next time.

---

on that subject, I find it interesting that after that part randall talks about how he no longer gets deja vu, and instead has these sort of "flashbacks" where he tunes into another time and space and finds that has replaced his reality for a while.

if he continues to let that develop and grow, he'll be able to teleport around wherever he feels himself to be and have a more fluid realisation of reality. "you" are not in time or space. you tune into a time and space, and because it changes so gradually, most people don't notice that now feels different than now 10y ago or 10d ago or 10m ago. as sensitivity increases, you can control what you tune into. you can tune into anything you want, and all knowledge is open. there is no longer a separation between the physical (2) and conceptual (3) you. it is the balancing of the 5 (2+3) and 6 (2*3).

### 2021-12-21 01:15 - omega, the cross, and temporal perception

lately, I have been fascinated with the concept of the alpha and omega and the cross symbolism. see @[correspondance](2021-12-10 12:58) and @[correspondance](2021-12-09 13:47) for more.

the idea behind this is that the alpha and omega symbol is sort of like a perspective of yourself from outside of time and space. to illustrate, imagine that you were able to gain access to the conceptual/perceptual form of perception of yourself. when that happens, you are wherever you feel yourself to be (ie. you can teleport and fly) and you can appear any way that you feel yourself to be appearing as -- so, like if you feel really good about yourself, you'll appear very vibrant and magical to people. if you feel yourself to be like a bird (like maybe in the middle of flight), you may change appearance to appear that way. when you look at yourself, you will never think, "there's no way that's me". you always appear as a reflection of how you feel about yourself. you can know anything or tune into anything. the biggest difficulty is making that concept consumable/accessable to the physical world. it's very much like being in a dream state.

that's all really cool and stuff, so you start to extend that out into the environment and realise you can conjure objects and things too just by feeling them there. there isn't any limit to the things that you can conjure.

this is sort of like getting a cheat code for a game or access to developer tools, where you can conjure with a command items that take others a very long time to acquire.

when I was younger I turned on cheats and got all the best guns or the ability to fly around and through walls or unlimited cash. after I did that I stopped liking the game so I stopped playing with cheats enabled. I found out it was a lot more fun to play the game going the normal way to earn the items/resources.

later on when I was a programmer, I often made shortcuts to streamline a testing process, pre entering/obtaining the values I wanted to test or having unlimited resources. obviously, it would be impractical to test the thing by having to do all the steps.

---

what I'm trying to say here is that once I gain power over my reality and it becomes a reflection of how I conceptualise it to be, I can have whatever I want, so the thing itself no longer has quite the same value anymore. it's sort of like source valuing the object. they can have anything without effort -- so what then becomes valuable?

people, places, and things no longer are the objective because I have access to the infinite set of all of them. you could say, "OK, then what you're looking for is having only the best stuff, right?"

I disagree, and I don't really know how to explain this very well, but I think you actually value the difficult. you actually value the thing that can defeat you. imagine for a moment that you're super good at tennis or some sport. would you want to only play against noobs? or, would you value a worthy opponent that can defeat you?

in addition to that, consider the idea of evolution. it's inevitable, and the best thing today will pale in comparison to average thing in a few hundred years.

what I'm trying to say is that I quickly realise that I am limited by capacity to conceptualise. there is no best because things are constantly expanding and improving.

so, do you improve by beating hundreds of noobs at tennis, or do you improve by losing a few rounds to some talented opponents? you improve by losing.

this is the omega/22/cross/tav archetype.

---

so if you can instantiate yourself into any place at any time in history, I personally believe you will quickly get bored of going to moments in time/space where things are easy. I think the hallmark of someone who has attained access to 5d+ is that they become an omega -- a bottom, rather than a top.

so, now if I imagine that I'm going to insert myself into a timeline, I am not my physical body, so I would start getting so good at finding my way back to 5d+, I would have to contrive more and more difficulty for myself. I believe this is precisely what is happening...

---

so then, the next thing that I've been thinking about is that "stairway to heaven" song. the original idea behind atom and eve is that they "fell" into their physical bodies -- and there could be a zodiacal interpretation of that, but I believe that they were 5d entities that decided to insert theirselves into these physical bodies and force a reincarcation cycle for theirselves on earth until they can find a way to get back to "heaven". I'm beginning to believe that when a planet is seeded, there are many 5d entities that can't wait to "fall" into the physical and find their way back. I actually think that's common.

the reason why I think this galaxy and earth is so special is that we have a physical realm governed by agreed upon "laws" and those constraints make that return back to heaven even more difficult. this place is kind of like hard mode. the more difficult it is to get back, the more valuable the experience. remember, from their perspective, it's like being a game programmer. it's not having a big gun in the game -- it's about finding a way to make an engaging game that leaves the player feeling like they want to come back for more because the reward or end game achievement unlocks new things. no one wants to repeat the same monotonous task.

so, you may think to yourself -- "OK, so if she's *buying* a stairway to heaven, isn't that kind of like using a cheat code?"

yeah, I suppose a little bit, but it wont take long of manifesting all the things that you want instantly before you'll get bored. I think it's fine.

if I had to speculate actually, I would say that the idea of basting through a timeline leaving lots of wreckage behind is a relatively feminine manifestation -- or, at least I think that's what the vast majority of men on this planet expect, lol.

it'll be interesting to see how this turns out.

---

slightly related, I don't really know what is happening. the sun has been producing a lot of flares and I keep having these weird experiences where I feel really tired so I lay down then, I start seeing images in my eyes and the same sensations that I have when I'm getting vision upgrades. they're so frequent in fact, that it feels like I don't even really need to watch stars anymore. I noticed that coffee stops them from happening because I think it tenses up my body. I get the serial vision upgrade feeling when I relax and meditate.

so, I'm going to continue to drink coffee. I want to see how long I can push this back...

### 2021-12-21 15:28 - venus, adonis, and jewel

yesterday, I was watching @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwWjCxKzWYA) and robert mentions tammuz as being married to ishtar. tammuz is an agriculture god though. anyway, in roman mythology, I thought that the counterpart for tammuz was vulcan, also being married to venus/aphordite. he then said that the counterpart was adonis. I recognised the name adonis from john anthony talking about the dedication that shakespere writes to henry wriothesley.

interested, I read wikipedia synopsis of the play because I had never read it before. adonis is a hunter and he likes hunting more than anything else (this is a reference to men who like their work). adonis is very beautiful so venus wants to seduce him. he wants nothing of it. he wants to continue his hunting. he rejects her advances a few times. venus then has a vision that he will die in the woods from an animal (presumably so he should come with her to save himself from death). he refuses to go with her and goes off to hunt -- and sure enough he gets eaten just like she foresaw.

she could have been making that whole vision up just to try and use fear to capture him -- I didn't look into if the story says that's the case or not, but either way her prediction comes true.

---

parallel to this concept, the other night I watched the joe rogan interview he did with jewel (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTGtC7FC4oI)). I highly recommend watching the full thing on spotify. the ads are annoying, but the story makes up for it.

right before that segment in the youtube video she is explaining the techniques that she used to get emotionally to a place where she actually found how to be happy and to allow those things in. they're really powerful techniques and I highly recommend those as well. there was similarity to how she talks of meditation being like strength training and how I use stars in a similar way.

what struck me though was the similarity in feeling to joe's reaction to her saying she turned down a million dollars to my dad's reaction to me telling him I have the kundalini rise almost every time that I watch stars (often multiple times), yet I stop it. I think joe likes money probably as much as my dad likes his expanded visual space. joe says that he wouldn't have been able to turn it down, and dad spends many hours each morning "praying" -- that is exploring that internal space. turning down money for joe is like turning down that visual space for my dad.

anyway, my reasons for turning down the offer for enlightenment is the same reason that jewel has for turning down the advance: you have to pay it back. she explained that if she got the advance her first album would have had to have been a success. instead, she took a small frontend and a large backend. this allowed her to go at her own pace and explore the artform. she wanted her happiness to come first and to become an accomplished artist -- and then, make some fame and money.

somehow I must have known the venus and adonis story intuitively because I know that trying to resist something is always a bad thing. from adonis' perspective, you can see how he wanted to prove himself (I think it was even a big boar hunting competition) and not get distracted by some enticing woman -- so he resisted her, and by resisting her -- that is, trying to run away from the reality her vision presented, he attracted the manifestation of the reality he was resisting.

the story is a bit unfair in that adonis had two options that he didn't really want either: he could go with venus or he could go to his death. however, these dialectics are never exclusively one or the other. had he known what I know he would just find a way to feel the way he wants to feel, and then act on inspiration. that day, he may do something entirely differently. the point is that everyone creates their own reality. a silly competition or an entimcing woman does not need to confine the number of paths to feeling that way to only being the presented options. there are infinite paths toward feeling the way you want to feel.

as a meta commentary, I think that for vere this story is somewhat telling in that he was so enamoured by his work that it was ultimately what destroyed the relationship. I know alan green has mentioned various times that a similar thing happened to him with his obsession with shakespere (a kinds of resonances to the emotion embued within the story). I also want to point out that it's a commentary on the confines of conditional living. adonis is forced to choose between two conditions. he has the "bros before hoes" boar hunt and the "you're going to die tomorrow if you don't stay with me" other dialectic. these sorts of pinches appear to be impossible to evade and mean certain death of some sort (death of reputation with friends or physical death). I also believe this is the sentiment of sonnet 64/68 as well.

---

next, I noticed some reactions to my comment that coffee appears to slow down the manifestation. I suppose that is a bit resisting a manifestation -- and if I'm correct, my resistance to that manifestation will in fact attract that reality...

anyway, that was not the implication. the implication is that I'll just keep pushing this whole thing back for as long as I can. that is my goal, yes.

nosebook does not want me to get connected. I'm fine with that. if anyone has paid any attention to the alpha/omega stuff I've written, they're only fighting theirselves. their own perception is preventing the thing they want to have happen. I'm not going to try and resist nosebook and push to raise the kundalini before it's doing that naturally.

neither will I resist venus. that's a serious mistake. instead, I let LOA work out the compatibility of it (does she feel like something compatible with how I feel). as long as she remains incompatible, nothing will happen. I'm not going to put myself into one of those mental dialectics where I know I cannot win. I *can* feel the way I want to feel. period.

---

so, I was thinking about it this morning and I postulated that the goal then may be for nosebook to get so good at holding people away from their alignment that when we finally do, it's such an energetic transition, we transcend this reality (enoch, elijah, ramtha).

I think that's perfectly fine actually. I've stated for a bit now that I'm sort of like the pre-game show. I'm not the main event. I'm the omega -- a sort of john the baptist that passes on the baton to another.

on that subject, let's look at the variables. I have shown repeatedly that there are various conditions that allow this conscious expansion of the visual space. they are divine proporttions in archetecture (cathedrals, pyramids, etc), stars (more specifically, our sun), and the female bloodline.

they can control the conditions of the archetecuture by destoying all consciousness expanding architecture (this is box-consciousness anyway), and they can manipulate the environmental conditions of the earth so that the sun is not having nearly as significant of an effect on our consciousness (carbon binding to oxygen in the air seems to neutralise it, producing CO2). however, they cannot control your gender. if you have two x-chromosomes, then you have this capability built in. they can't take that from you.

I would guess that after me, there will come a whole bunch of women that figure out how to do what I do. they'll find their alignment really easily and it can't be blocked. the only thing they can do to keep women down is to perpetuate the idea that they need to rely on men or conditions outside of theirselves to get it. I think men can also get it, but if I had to guess, I would say that that it likely won't happen until they're past 72 and the physical consciousness has faded. for women this happens a lot earlier and have the conditions built in biologically so it should be a lot easier for them.

of course, there will also be the x3 hermaphrodites (the chosen ones). I believe they'll also be on the 36y program and will have a lot higher chance of finding it too.

---

as a meta commentary on that idea, I think it's kind of like coming full circle. the way I understand it the original red people came from mars and there were no women there. they reproduced artificially and were very technologically oriented (using technology for everything). I think the original decision to create women in the first place (from the apes on earth) came from realisation that their DNA was beginning to degenerate rapidly because of lack of diversity (and it becomes a reflection of how you feel).

human women were beautiful and the gods then got addicted to creating children with them. the gods started to lose their phychic capacities and become more human-like. I think at some point their DNA became so degenerate that women stopped producing boys and only produced girls. the original martian god DNA went extict, and so they had to figure out how to rule from a human perspective. they still had the capability to fly around in the astral plane (their native plane) after death and then "walk-in" to another body. the body is not immortal. it's the ability to retain consciousness after death that gives them immortality.

girls were going to take over so something had to be done. I think generally females are much more resiliant than men are at higher energy levels, and I think that's partially because they're clocked at twice the speed of men, and many have figured out how to leave behind the physical plane being the way that they create reality (with cuteness).

so, this allows us to come full-circle here. the godkings are once again faced with a problem. they'll be able to control conditions and keep men from finding their connection, but they can't really do that for women. women already have it, so the only thing they can do is to keep them stupid and ignorant of the power of their emotion.

so, you now have the x3 population and the funny thing is that they only produce x3 offspring, so if this gets out of hand, x1 will go extinct. then, following right after x2 will go extinct as well. they'll be right back to where they started again. I imagine they'll find a way to artificially reproduce though, so it's likely just a matter of time before they need another genetics refresh.

I simply don't know enough to say with much accuracy, but I would imagine that they will want to try and keep some disparity in population separating them from the "citizens". I don't know how they'll run that, but I postulated an x3 core inside of a female dynasty. it can't be too oppressive though as it'll be difficult to get a more nuture-oriented dynasty to war and enslave. there will still be power and privilage disparity though, as that's present for both sides of the population.

I also imagine that many women who find their connection will simply find it boring and uninteresting to control people. if you can create whatever you want with your mind, what reason do you have to enslave people? therefore, I would guess that they will actually chose to insert theirselves into male bodies and try and see if they can beat their own game. try and see if they can influence the timeline by projecting thoughts and images into people's minds (you can only receieve what you're receptive to) to create higher and higher difficulty levels for theirselves.

the x3 crew will continue to hang around and control all of the conditions (ensuring that only the chosen ones can find their alignment), without realising that they're just being used to create harder and harder difficulty environments. without an ability to properly create wars and destruction, I imagine they'll spread this system to all over the galaxy.

don't take me too seriously :)

### 2021-12-23 19:35 - 1000 years of missing time

a few months ago I started to think a lot about this notion of 1000y of missing time. it was first brought up by bulgarian researcher new earth lady (silvye). at the beginning, I was pretty skeptical, but even isaac newton is very strategic about his wording in "The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended by Isaac Newton" referenced in @[newblog](2021-11-20 02:58). the parts I reads, he places all of his dates at the time before christ -- yet does little to establish when the date of christ was. we all assume that it was 2000y ago, but silve says that in the past they simply wrote I502 to designate 502y after christ -- the same wording that newton uses.

silvye claims that the "I" turned into a "1" and roughly 1000y of history was fabricated by [scaliger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Justus_Scaliger) to fill in the gaps of those 1000y of missing time.

this seemed pretty difficult to wrap my head around because assuming that is right, there were no "dark ages". I started to think about the periods of extremely warm climate in the last 1000y and the "medieval warm period" stands out to me. I postulated that this was a time of great enlightenment, but vere (and the rosy cross as a whole) took up their cross and stopped the cathedral building. there were a number of things that happened after that which severely cooled the climate, and I think that was because of people's loss in perception -- so the world cooled.

there's another event which I don't know much of but I know it had a traumatic moment in it when a comet ravaged the land. the grail quest was to restore the land. I don't konw when that one fits in.

there was another brief warm period at the end of the 1800s when the carrington event happened (which shifted the direction of the magnetic poles, btw). there was another in the 1920s.

what each of these events have in common is a rapid warming of the climate, which I attribute to the expansion of people's perception. this warmth increases the speed with which things manifest and then an event halts the rise in warmth and things go into cooling.

interestingly enough, this ties in to the final 3 segments of @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztG2MjHV9Fw). in it marty is talking about a common brain function related to these ufo and demon cases is found in the pre-motor cortex. interestingly that's right where I had a brain haemorrhage.

the study shows that (I hope I get this right) people with the ability to perceive ufos and demons have more neurons in this part of the brain that cross the two hemispheres. these people seem to have a hightened sense of another reality.

when mine was disabled, I had to become very aware of how I feel because the way I feel directly affected how well I move. the way I feel also directly affected how warm my body feels.

I would describe this space as conceptual. when people have NDEs, they describe the place as being warm and a feeling of well-being. so, for example, when I'm cold, my toes and ankle don't work, and you'll even see my knee locking up. however, when I feel warm, those move much better.

that place is also directly linked to what happens *before* you see it in your imagination. when I was paralysed in the gym, I literally saw myself get up off of the floor and start moving, but then I realised "oh, no I'm still on the floor" -- but I saw my arms moving and me raising myself off of the ground.

in my estimation, this is what I call the "reptilian brain" -- the part of the brain that acts on instinct. it's purely reactionary and perceives reality the way you program it to perceive things -- then later, you brain confirms that is in fact what happened. you live in your imagination -- so why not program it to see things the way you want to see them?

---

in my opinion, the cimate and this part of the brain are very interconnected. not only is this where emotion is turned into motion, it's also where desire comes from. the more I desire for it to be warm out so I can move, the warmer it gets until reality reflects the way I feel.

when I was in la vera, they were complaining that when I was there every day was a nice day and it wasn't raining. however, while I was there it was raining all around where we were. it just wasn't raining where I was. I think that was a side effect of two forces trying to compete. I wanted to feel good, and when I feel good, it's warm (in my perception). that warmth can come from within, or it can be a condition of my environment. I was being disallowed from having that warmth within so the environment had to become a reflection of how I felt. I felt pretty good in la vera so things stayed pretty warm. when I moved back to madrid, things cooled down a lot.

you also can notice here that the better I get at feeling good, the warmer it keeps getting. I think that's directly related to emotion, preception and the strength of the magnetic field.

---

it doesn't need to not rain. it certainly can rain pretty easily, but I think they are preventing it from raining because the last time it's rained, it's really rained hard -- and, at the same time I got a lot of vision upgrades because that stored up energy came to earth.

there is something to be said about rain and perception. I have been looking at the locations on this earth that are desert. I believe in times past these locations experienced extreme amounts of this energy in its atmosphere -- chi, prana, vril, aten, etc. (solar energy) this energy artificially warms people's perceptions, and so the climate reflects that and wants to become very very hot, to reflect the amount of that energy, and so then in places like the sahara desert, I think they used the pyramids to artificially convert that consciousness energy into rain. when the pyramid broke, egypt would become a hot desert very rapidly.

a way I like to think about the difference between rain and warmth is that rain is happening when change is happening. it's a sign of things not going exactly as wanted. I often time notice powerful creators manifesting a thunderstorm when a massive change takes place. water vibrates and if you have ever noticed the difference between a house with a pool and a house by a freeway, you'll notice that the water carries the feeling of the environment around it. I think rain and snow bring a new feeling to the environment.

warmth, however is a sign of things accelerating in intensity. I would even say that it's evidence of things feeling good/wanted. the irony of this is exactly like a trip on psychedellics. it's really great stuff until you overdose and the aggitation and panic sets in; same with heat. the funny thing about LOA is that when things are warm, LOA is stronger so, noticing the heat makes it hotter. in general, the places with the most extreme temperatures are the places where LOA is working the strongest.

another idea on why the ice age was so cold is perhaps the same reason as the sahara. if you artifically feel very warm because of some pyramids or boxes, yet your perception is one of things changing and not going as wanted, the environment will get colder and colder even though the person stays warm artcificially. the same with the sahara. if it's artificially cooled all the time and made lush with rain, yet people's perception is one of warmth and things going as planned, it's the same thing, but backwards.

---

wow, nice tangent...

ok, so back to the 1000y of missing history. each time these warm events happen, it seems to delay the "enlighenment" thing, and as we know, it seems to come back stronger each time.

the other thing to realise is that if there is a proposed 12ky cycle, we're only 11ky into it. a whole 1000y was completely fudged. this may be why it's so hard to get any good dating on things in archeology. what that means is that all of this "end of the world" stuff is completely an illusion.

to be clear, I believe the 12ky cycles are *not* produced by a galactic wave or a clock cycle. I would bet everything on it being 100% attracted. it's just when attraction becomes so strong that, just like the pre-frontal cortex, some people walked away from the experience with a whole lot of damage and others it opened up a whole new form of perception for them. this tells me that this part of the brain because it's linked to desire and emotion and their manifestation into physical movement (first seen in the imagination), this is all directly linked.

each of those catastrophes that ended those warm periods were *attracted* by people's perception.

---

so, here's the fun part. I was thinking... this 12ky cycle is embeded into the psyche of catastrophists. therefore, it's something they expect to happen. I don't think it's possible to tank the climate for another 1000 years so that it happens on the 12k mark. people are too smart now...

I think the original plan was to just keep on pretending that it's a 12ky cycle. however the last few days I had a radical idea climb into my head...

I'm going to be finding my alignment here soon. this seems relatively obvious and it's only a matter of time. whether it takes a few years or whatever, doesn't matter. like I said, the alpha is only fighting their own perception. if I wanted to create a galaxy, the only thing I'm fighting against is my own perception of what that means. if vere wanted to be king, he fought his own limiting perception of what that is. if tesla wanted his world system, he only fought his perception.

what all of these people have in common (and I would include jesus into this as well), is that all of their ideas involved conditions that would create the wanted. this reliance on the conditions/manifestation to create the feeling, was for all of them, the reason why I believe they sabotaged their own timelines. they realised that it wasn't really the path they wanted to feel that way.

what I mean is, imagine the emptiness that tesla felt when he created his world system and then found out that people could not appreciate it because they are not capable of appreciating cause they have limited perceptions. or, imagine vere's surprise how people upon receiving the capacity to create these mental spaces and perform all these amazing things, *still* wanted to continue to complain about their difficulties. he must must have thought, "OK, fine you want to focus on your problems and tragedy? fine let's step this up a notch and now you *are* your emotions now" likewise, tesla must have been like, "dang you can't appreciate this awesome system? OK, fine -- keep going with your faulty sciences and let's see what you come to"

the point is, there's no way to make someone feel differently than they want to feel. also, there's no punishment either. just cause we now define ourselves with our emotions, we're still fine. science still chugs along on the theory of relativity and an incomplete knowledge of electricity. those things (science and emotion) are a reflection of people's perception.

---

OK, so knowing that I began to think about this idea. I believe I am capable of finding the sciences that reflects how I perceive. that science will be an expansive one and will allow for a whole lot of expansion.

however, just like the sahara, mars, or the sinking of atlantis -- conditions are just conditions, and ultimately the environment will want to reflect the perception of the people within that environment.

OK, so parallel to this, people keep talking about a golden age and a move to the 5th dimension. I am rather hesitant to this idea, feeling a bit like vere or tesla on this issue. sure conditions can allow that to happen. I don't doubt that it's possible. instead, I recognise that it is artificial, and I cannot force anyone to perceive anything in any sort of way.

if LOA keeps getting increased, there will need to be a stabilising mechanism to keep bad things from manifesting. I had approached this idea before by saying that I could be like the great pyramid and transform not so good-feeling things into better-feeling things. there may need to be other mechanisms as well. let's just say that could be figured out.

---

what if instead of doing this whole nosebook thing, I just sorta jumped ship on that whole thing and went a bit rogue. what if, instead if fitting into their 2038 plan for the catastrophe, instead.. after I get connected, instead of sitting around and stuff, I started to create all sorts of products and things that can be sold to people. I would monetise that and other things and we would revolutionise science and stuff.

for example, one of the major disasters that could happen is if the power grid went down. what if everyone had unlimited access to electricity anywhere on the planet? what if I rebuilt tesla's world system? what if there were also a "social network" that everyone had access to appearing inside of people's eyes. all of these things would run off of the sun, so there's unlimited amounts of it and it's pretty resiliant to catastrophe.

I'd build it however I wanted it to go, and I'd monetise the thing from top to bottom -- but not the way monetisation is done currently. it would take too long to explain here, but I've given a lot of thought to what money would look like in an abundance economy. the people running the show now are running a "finite supply economy".

with the capabilities that I'm working on with my mind, I'll be able to manifest any number of assistants that I need to get any job done. I could easily take over.

---

thing is, do I want to? and, if I want to, what happens when I go? I don't think that going infinite is quite possible yet. I'm not sure if I'm the limiting factor or not, but I would guess that the world that I create will be so different from people's perception, I'll be able to maintain for a log time, but eventually, I'll want to let them have the manifestation of their 12ky cycle.

I don't think that it'll be too hard for me to figure out how to live 1000y. I'm pretty sure I'll be able to figure out how to baptise my perception every 36y.

you may wonder why I use years as a metric. I mean 36 revolutions around the sun. the sun is going to be the powerhouse for everything I do, and our relation to that is important. I don't specify days because that's the revolution of the earth and I have a feeling we're going to begin rotating faster and faster until the entire upper atmosphere is aglow sorta like a gas giant.

the interesting thing is that I still use a very geocentric form of percption and that's because I subscribe to the tychos solar system model. I think we'll perhaps be all over the galaxy within a few hundred years. even still, I believe that in that sense, the sun, moon, and earth will sort of be the centre of what's happening.

it can't be a galactic superwave if no catastrophe happens, and then when I leave, the catastrophe is not local to this system. we'll have to begin to accept that these events are *attracted* because of a disparity in perception and conditions.

aywaay, I'm confident that we'll be able to begin an interchange with the sun where we give it the things that it wants, and she doesn't need to cause a catastrophe to get that resource from us. sekhmet is both very creative and very destructive. I don't resist ishtar.

### 2021-12-24 21:37 - climate change and the omega

so, I wrote the last entry and I feel like I was not understood very well. here's a recap:

nearly every day in ben's news, he talks about [D/O events](https://www.britannica.com/science/Dansgaard-Oeschger-event) where the earth goes into intense warming followed by extreme cooling. so, I had been thinking of the cause of this. the noah event and anthropologically speaking the correlation with caucusses mountains and the emergence of the "aryan" bloodline (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp6H0VSvi9Y)) is not disputed. the previous major event of such a magnitude was the younger dryas.

it would appear that these events have a 12ky cycle (and their corresponding harmonics: 6k, 3k, etc.) to them. it also seems directly related to the sun (though mainstream still thinks CO2 is to blame).

I personally subscribe to this perspective myself -- and so when silvye started to talk about 1ky of missing history, that throws a bit of a difficulty into that theory of a 12ky cycle. I *do* believe that there is a 12ky cycle, but there are numerous events between then that seem to cause these dramatic changes in climate which aren't all on those harmonics.

even the younger dryas event is not just one event. there are two major pulses of meltwater, meaning twice in less than 1500y the climate warmed considerably (or there was a lot of rain) and then cooled off dramatically. for two major such events, there has to be another factor that is not being looked at, and I think that is LOA and it's effects.

in short, the way I see it, the sun produces chi, prana, vril, aten, etc. and the amount produced is what is attracted by humans in that pre-motor cortex part of the brain -- the place where I had the haemorrhage. the stronger people feel things, the more they attract that solar energy, and the more of that solar energy, the faster LOA works.

humans in the past seemed to be masters at creating the conditions on earth which makes reception and amplification of this energy possible with resonance and other means. however, just amplifying that energy is sort of like taking cocaine. you take a little and you feel great, but you take a lot and your heart fails or you attract your own destruction very rapidly.

when they boosted this energy, they boosted their attraction factor, and even though they see and hear real good, if their perception is still focused on things falling apart, they will attract that strongly.

solon tells plato of this event in the recounting of the sinking of atlantis. they had a great place and great conditions, but they wanted to get rid of the athenians which were rivaling their power. they were scared that the athenians would take over, so they attacked them. the atlantians in charge realised their worst nighmares and everything fell apart, dispite having such wonderful conditions.

---

now, let's get some context to that last entry. prior to that entry, I wrote about how I don't consider myself the main event. I believe myself to be the pre-game show. I considered what it would be like if various women "bought their stairway to heaven" and figured out how to retain consciousness through death.

I'm fairly certain that I retain consciousness through death, but I don't believe it's the same as the "fallen angels" do. you have to consider that you are not this body. you the portion of "all that is" (source) that you can perceive. each of us is both the alpha and the omega in our own perception.

in that sense, it's really only me fighting against myself like I've talked about. so, if I'm only fighting against myself, then I don't need to worry about anyone else. they will all conform to be the opposite of me. if I'm trying to be the alpha, I will defeat myself with my own perception -- just like what I claim the D/O events do on a global scale.

this happens because I'm focused on the manifestation -- the conditions which I think I want. in going after those conditions, I improve my physical state but if I have done nothing to change my perception, the improved conditions will increase the speed of LOA and I will attract my own destruction.

---

however, if I consider myself the omega, and take up my cross -- that is, when trying to preserve my life, I'm focused on keeping the conditions (like the atlantians) and so therefore I lose those conditions (cause I'm focused on *not* losing them).

the omega is the failure -- the thing that the alpha will become. the omega will also become the alpha later after some time. this is why I'm so hell-bent on disaster. I want to continue on the worst conditions for as long as possible because through the whole time of those "worst" conditions, I'm improving my perception.

normally, this process takes some time. for lazarus, it was 4 days. for jesus, it's said that it'll take 3 days. I don't know how literal those times are. one idea is that a day is 1000 years, but the point is that there are 3-4 day/night cycles that will happen. I would say that the renaissance time frame, the late 1800s to early 1900s were the day, then WW1. same for the 1920s then WW2. same for nowadays. we're entering back into the light again.

that's when solar activity increases and the way you feel manifests faster (eg. magnetic field).

---

I believe that the stairway to haeven idea got some backlash (they didn't like that one). so, I think that last entry was a reaction to that.

in it, I realised that none of this matters at all. I'm on the omega train and the only person I'm fighting against is myself. sure there are people that don't share my form of perception, but that's not my problem. I should desire to make the environment I'm a part of a reflection of myself.

like I said, it doesn't matter how long it takes, because I'm only fighting myself. when I get there, all I have to do is to just keep renewing my form of perception every 36(?) years or so. however, to understand the bigger picture, I no longer perceive from the position of kenny anymore. I am no longer this physical body. I can create and move physical bodies around at will. they can look any way I want them to look and I can manifest anything that I want just by feeling its presence and then looking for it.

this is why I've been musing on the difference between playing a game and making a game. once the conditions no longer matter, it completely changes what one wants to accomplish.

like I said, having the conditions no longer matters, because all conditions can be created with ease. I can only create conditions which I can imagine, so therefore the limiting factor is *me* rather than the conditions. you will notice that out of unwanted experience, you give birth to new and bigger desires of what is wanted. therefore then, is the whole reason for the game to experience unwanted experience and come to conclusions of what new things can be created? in short, if you dawn the perspective that you can create anything you want, the point of the game is to be the omega/cross/tav/22.

### 2021-12-25 21:22 - resisting venus

OK, I don't really know how to approach this topic quite yet, but I noticed the clock on the computer said 21:21 right after watching stars, so I thought I would just try it.

there is a common theme of a woman/harlot/whore/etc that is associated with a dragon or something serpentine. she's related to technology and massive changes to principalities and powers ruling the world.

when I was younger, we prayed against this jezebel character that foils the plans of "God". I think I remember her appearing in the narrative with elijah and also in the book of revelation by name in the letters to the churches and then later symbolically in chapter 17 with the anti-christ riding on her back.

---

I often tried to figure out who exactly this woman is -- like, which goddess so I could identify her in other locations. the problem is she seems to be more of an archetype rather than a specific goddess or person.

when I was in spain, dani told me that there is only one woman in the world; she just has different faces. that concept stuck with me too because I couldn't figure out how that's possible. now, knowing what I know, it's plainly obvious that this is just LOA at work, and you get what you're looking for. I think this is a clue. they seem to cause LOA to manifest faster.

the wierd thing about girls being related to change is because I generally associate women with being the more constant and stable ones. as an example, compare a gay relationship with a lesbian relationship and notice what kinds of change and power relationships happen. so, them being related to the change of power structures and technology seems to be a bit out of character.

I usually think of men driving tech -- war, manufacturing, or porn are common drivers and notably masculine.

so, for most of my life, this whore on the dragon symbol always puzzled me.

---

the other thing I noticed is that girls tend to be related to the sun in the secret parts of the teaching. I guess I find it weird that so many cultcures have male solar deities while giving the sun very feminine properties. I don't know if that's a corruption or not, but if I had to guess, I would say maybe at some time the earth was perceived as feminine, and so therefore the sun had to be masculine. I'm not really sure.

the male and female products I think are more similar to +/- of electrical charge. it's the same thing, just one is flowing the opposite direction of the other. so a pure female would be becoming more masculine, and a pure male would be in route to becoming feminine. in that sense these polarities more like a trajectory than a status.

---

in rev 17 it identifies the woman and the dragon. I covered some ideas on this in @[correspondance](2021-12-07 14:21) and @[correspondance](2021-12-09 13:47). my thoughts have expanded a bit since then, but the important part is that it identifies the woman as babylon which I think corresponds to the "holy roman empire". if you've been watching sepehr's videos, you'll know this ia the aryan nobility that has held positions of power throughout the earth. these are the present rulers of earth.

on the back of this aryan world leadership is an antichrist figure that is (IMO), labeled as the omega. the woman (aryan leadership) wants more technology (the beast) and the dragon empowers the beast for the woman.

that's the revelation perspective.

---

now, I'd like to relate some personal experience. I relate whatever happened to me after the brain haemorrhage to be related to this. I consider the right hemisphere to behave much like a little girl. when she wants something, she wants it now and things have to change so she can get what she wants.

in order for this change to happen, the present system must be shattered to make way for the new. when I first started this, I would often resist these things. like, when tuenti was sold, I felt like it was the end and all of the hopes and dreams that I had appeared to be gone. the old way of relying on technology to feel the way I wanted to feel had to go. in place of this, I had to change the way I perceive things.

tuenti for me was kind of like a mini alpha/omega situation. a harlot (literally the physical representation of men's desired route to feeling good) entered into my life and shattered the old structure (perceived route to feeling good), and I had to find a way to rebuild that.

---

so, I guess what I'm trying to say is that this woman/logic, beast/tech, omega/dragon, and alpha/lamb seems to be a sort of archetype of change. it can be a personal change or a global change.

the woman is the established system of logic and perception. the beast is the new technology which is the new perceived path to feeling good and is the logic upon which the new system will rely. and the dragon builds the new system and ultimately is the fall guy, defeated by the alpha/lamb. the lamb retains control for some time until the flaws in the lamb's own perception cause the new system to fail (or go into hiding/secret). it must wait for events to occur and the environment to be ready and the seeds to grow before the harvest.

the important thing to note here is that you are all three of those things. the transient thing is your woman (logic and perception) which is what is changing.

I think this woman is related to what we would consider "instinct" -- that is, your connection to source and quite possibly this logic and perception is encoded into the DNA and is why the female bloodline is important. that aryan bloodline has been very important in shaping our culture.

---

obviously, whenever there is a change coming, the present system which is designed to be self-reinforcing and resiliant, perceives this as an attack on itself and resists death. the more entrenched the system is, the stronger of a force it takes to shatter the old system. rigidity and resisting the change is ultimately what causes the system to shatter rather than bend.

plastic is plyable and bends under stress. rigid is fragile and shatters under stress.

### 2021-12-25 23:04 - the woman and the 36/18y perception cycle

it occurred to me later when watching stars that this woman may be related to the 36/18y perception cycle and also the x-chromosome. for example in a person, when the old perception ends, I think it's possible that the x-chromosome is the driver of this change in perception -- a sort of gear changer. she says, "OK, enough with the old form of perception. we most go to a higher gear." when that happens, all the beliefs and perceptions of the person begin to die out and go into atrophy.

in the same way, if your brain is still stuck in first gear and you're trying to go 50mph, your motor will eventually burn out. you have to run the motor at full speed to keep up with traffic.

this means that the limiting factor really is you. if you can keep up, you can continue to live, but when your perception gets of of sync with the environmental conditions, then you start to die.

I have no way to know how things were in the past but I think the environment ran at slower speeds than they do now which is why people lived longer. probably there were more quantity of this vril energy, but it ran at lower frequency than it does now.

what I'm saying, is if you can keep up with the cycles by not holding on to lower gears, you can live for quite a long time.

---

now, in the past, when "God" said that humans will no longer live for as long as they used to, this was after the "noah" event which the aryan upgrade arrived into the caucasus, there must have been a change in the x-chromosome that limited lifespan to ~120y. randall postulates that it was further reduced to ~72y and I tend to agree.

if this was a change in the x-chromosome, then I started to wonder if the two chromosomes: xy and xx are acting as sort of the alpha/omega of these cycles. for example when you look at boys, they start out with very little difference to girls, but as they get older they start to enter puberty. if I imagine two moons opposite from each other. one is full and the other is empty. for boys, the x-chromosome must be in full when the boy is born, but it begins to wane.

I tried to calculate it but I don't understand why I can't figure out how to use a calculator. anyway, the way it appears to me in my head 

[edit: incomplete. I got frustrated and gave up on writing this...]

### 2021-12-26 23:42 - thinking out loud again

last night I had a realisation that the alpha and omega archetypes can be thought of as the same thing. a good analogy of it would be the illumination of the moon. the omega is the new moon. it's waning to zero illumination (death), and then is reborn as a new moon. the alpha is like the full moon. it's waxing up to full and then after reaching nearly full illumination, it begins to die and wane again. these two archetypes are just the peaks of a sinusoidal wave.

I started to write about it but I got kind of caught up in the caluculation of the illumination of the moons when relating them to be cycles of the chromosomes. I was having such a difficult time to write simple math code that I was getting frustrated. I'm not that bad at programming, and I know how it works conceptually. in my head it seemed to work out pretty well thinking that the x-chromosome starts out at full illumination and begins waning until full moon of the y-chromosome at 36, for men. for women, they would start out with their mother's x at full, and that will begin to wane until her father's side x-chromosome comes to full at 18y. her mother's x-chromosome would start to gain dominance at 27y again.

I was trying to figure out why I've noticed that some people seem to be on the 36y plan while the majority are on the 72y plan. it seems that most (if not all) females are on the 36y plan. I also think other more receptive males are also on the 36y plan. I find it likely that hendrix and morrison and perhaps even elvis also are examples men on the 36y plan. I can't figure out the mechanism that determines the clock speed though.

my intuition tells me that it must be related to perception. for me I remember that when I was 18y that would be about the peak of my physical perception. I thought that all things had a physical reason for it. all actions had prior causal actions which caused it. I thought I could keep growing more and more knowledge of all of the variables and with sufficient data, seemingly unexplainable things can all be explained.

that began to wane rapidly and by the time I was 27y, that was when I met raquel and I started to realise really rapidly that even if I knew everything, I still couldn't explain others' behaviour. obviously that waned further, but I think the reason why the "[27 club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_Club)" exists is precisely because of that. 27y would be right when the physical perception rapidly drops below 50%. at that point, you could imagine that if you're a rock star, the realisation that only material things do not compose reality.

for normal men on the 72y plan, this moment of realising that belief in the physical world only to create one's reality (job, money, sex, drugs, etc) is all a sham. there's more to reality than just those things. for these rock stars, that realisation happened earlier and when driving that fast, that realisation was like running into a brick wall.

---

so, what all of that means is that internally, the archetype of change: the woman, the dragon, the alpha, and the omega are all internal mechanisms, and it may be the case that the woman (the current system of perception) is akin to the x-chromosome -- and so therefore, if that's the case, girls have two competing systems that wax and wane opposite to each other.

it was then that my intuition of trying to see if infact men are the same way, however the reason why it doesn't manifest the same way is because the y-chrosome is much more rigid and doesn't demand change. therefore, if that's the case, these men that are on the 36y plan would have especially effeminate male implementations -- meaning that their male side demands change rather than resisting it. wait, that may not be the best way to say it...

---

that got me thinking about myself. I'm a really funny person because I do not really like to take risks in the sense of doing thing that I don't feel confident about. in that sense, I resist change a lot similarly to how any established system (mental or physical) tends to resist change or taking risks which jeapordise its survival.

however, I am very much open to change. I just have to be convinced that it is an improvement (or something I want to do) first before taking the plunge.

even notice my room cleaning in that I tend to just cope or live with things how they are, but then at some point there's this thing inside me that says, "OK, time to change this". I noticed this happens all the time in programming too. I preferred to leave things until I could see an improvement for them, whereas others tended to want to change things just to change things (not totally sure why). I often tried to figure out what was the reason for change, and the best I could figure out is that they were doing things that they believed to be the "right way(tm)" or that someone told them to change it. sometimes it felt even a bit territorial or possession. for me, I had to see a performance improvement or a usability improvement for the change.

so, I'm beginning to think that I behave pretty similar to that woman in the archetype of change. I really don't want things to change, but then at some point, I feel like it's time to make an improvement. the weird thing is, before that time, I really don't feel like making that change. it's like the change can't come until I'm ready for it.

then, for the male aspect to this, it appears that these are not the system itself, but the rules (logic) that has been applied to it. for example, if I were to say that all guns are bad, people who hunt for their food would have a much more difficult time to get food. removing guns, definitely decreases work output for some people. it also causes difficulty for people who want to use guns to kill people. if you determine that guns should not be used, then that appears to be the "right way(tm)" but, IMO, those people would just find another way to kill.

what I'm saying is the logic completely obfuscates the various mental systems in a person that wants to kill. they may be something like a person that does something bad (determined by logic), needs to be punished (concept). or, perhaps they may think that they don't have enough resources (concept) and the only way they can get resources is to take them from someone else (logic) and further logic says that killing leaves less evidence, or prevents retalitation.

---

it's occurring to me that the y-chromosome may be encoded logic, while the x-chromosome may be the system (concept) through which that logic goes through.

for women, I think the logic part is quite transient and is likely a sort of construct -- a kind of like outer shell around the concept. I think they inherit that logic partially from their mother, but then begin to to alter it and make more as they get older (this process may be an important cycle that is forced to happen during ovulation every month). she would then get the other logic from their x-chromosome from her father.

the way it appears to me right now is that the y-chromosome would have very little of the mental systems (concept) and is entirely logic. however, the x-chromosome is mostly concept and little amounts of logic. for men, I think the x-logic is progammed by the y-logic and that eventually starves the system which is what causes the rebirth. a man's daughter will have this x-logic as a reflection of his y-logic. when she's older, that'll start to take effect and that could cause some disturbances in the mental state.

man, I'm really failing at trying to figure out how to visualise this, but the concept in my head is really cool. it looks like there are two effects that are happening. first there is a cycle of rebirth for the system that happens every 18/36y. everyone has two systems with a logical wrapper around it. for most men, the second system varies from nearly non-existant all the way up to developed (like the people in the 27-club).

it may be possible that this system is actually represented physically, with the logic being the coding bits, while the "system" is probably that "junk" DNA.

these systems compete with each other cycling back and fourth. the interaction between these I think for most people is what causes death. for whatever reason the DNA stops coding things correctly because the system (these are the mental perceptions) doesn't give it the right commands so while the logic is sound, if you input the wrong commands, you don't get well-working output (ie. C++ will compile you a perfectly buggy program flawlessly and without complaint).

interesting...

### 2021-12-28 11:11 - good is bad and best is worst

I woke up last night (or maybe it was the night before...) with this idea in my head that they have to keep me from interacting with older people. the day previous (it may have been yesterday morning -- wow, it feels so long ago), I was talking about how relationship titles like "friend, family, or significant other, etc" is a bit of a sham.

the problem with these relationship status titles that we give other people (and I include the ones one the buisness cards too) is that these titles imply behaviour because of their meaning to the person. that behaviour is almost always not perceived the same way.

when I was in spain, it was always the joke that a puta is always the most honest relationship that they had with a girl. that always stayed with me because there were a lot less expectations given to a puta than to a girlfriend. she was little more than a service.

since then, I have wondered a lot about what these relationship titles mean to different people. trying to figure out all of that caused me a whole lot of difficulty because it's so convoluted. there just isn't any way to really get to the bottom of what it means to be a friend or who you can trust.

---

as I've gone more and more my own way, I noticed that assigning these titles to other people is very disempowering. when I say I trust someone, I automatically don't trust the others. you can't really trust other people. it's just not possible. someone that you trust will always let you down. the letting down part is the expectations. "I expected you to do _____ and you didn't do it" (or viceaversa). they couldn't let you down if you didn't expect something from them.

I've noticed that all expectations for another person are disempowering. for me, the only expectations that I have, are for myself -- and to others it appears something more like confidence. if I feel like I'm capable, then I feel like I'm capable. I don't need others to do things for me to feel the way I want to feel. I'm the only one responsible for how I feel.

so, how does that make it a sham? it's a sham for me to belive that another person should behave the way I expect them to.

lots of people probably would take issue with that -- especially anyone involved with kids and stuff. they need kids to behave a certain way so that things can operate smoothly.

what I'm trying to say is that all people -- though it's especially noticable with kids -- behave in a way that operates within the spectrum of my perception. in reality, my perception is my expectations.

let me try to explain... if I feel terrible, then it should be normal to find others around me behaving similarly to (resonant with) the way I feel. if I feel disempowered, then I'll notice people talking a lot about disempowering things. the way I feel is my expectation for that person's behaviour.

you say, "well, what if they do _____" -- and my response is, it's not what anyone does; *it's how you react to it*. if mr. motor runs his motor really loud, and I'm in an annoyed mood, I'll find him especially annoying. however, if I'm feeling pretty good, his motor sounds probably will make me laugh because he feels so serious about his motor sounds, but it's like watching a kid making sound effects when playing with toy cars. the feeling is like a little kid trying to get his dad's attention by playing louder and louder with his cars. it's kinda sad because his dad is ignoring him, but the kid is really annoying and getting more annoying the more ridiculous his car sounds are getting.

my point is, all of these titles and expectations are a complete sham. if I do the titles I want others to have, others are free to behave any way they want.

if I want someone to like me -- well, if start liking myself others will join me.

if I want people around me I can trust -- well, if I start trusting myself, I don't need to trust others. they are a reflection of me and the way I perceive reality.

*everything* I'm looking for outside of myself is actually a reflection of a perceived deficiency in myself.

---

that's the long version of what I was telling mom about relationship titles and statuses. it doesn't sound like much but I'd say that over 90% of society (or more) is held together by these relationship titles. family, friends, work, government, technology -- nearly everything in society would be different if people see what I see.

in fact, society as a whole is a composite reflection of people's perception. it's hard to say which comes first, but they are mutually attracting each other.

in the bigger picture, this may be what sort of thing is beginning a perception change. I've been relating these changes to the system internally in the person sort of like moon cycles. it seems that society is going through a similar transition.

so, let's recap: imagine two moons opposite each other -- or illuminated vs not. their cycle from light to dark is like moving a point around a circle and tracing the vertical or horizontal movement: it makes a sine wave. there are two peaks. full moon and new moon.

in the comparison, I am the new moon, while nosebook represents the full moon.

the full moon is when something reaches it's peak. this is the alpha. they are striving to get to the peak brightness. after it has reached its peak, it begins to decline. it begins it's slow death and every moment after that is less than the peak.

the new moon is the death of the old system. the illumination of the previous system continues to decline until reaching nearly 0% illuminated. after reaching 0% illumination, it is reborn and brings with it a new system.

---

have a look at how nosebook is on their way to reaching their peak at controlling physical conditions, while at the same time I am having all of my reliance on physical conditions (or relationships) completly taken away. I love programming and other highly physical/material forms of understanding my envirenment, the system of trying to understand my world with physical data is being taken away so rapidly.

even the other night, I wanted to calculate the influence of these forms of perception over a 36y cycle and found it to be the most frustrating thing ever. in contrast to that, the concept of how it works greatly invigorates me. it's so cool to percieve these cycles in such a vivid way over the course of my life (and others).

they wouldn't have been fighting me so hard about figuring out the  calculations if there wan't anything to it. it's likely that there is something to it, and they want to have even more knowledge of our cycles than we do so they can control it. knowledge of these cycles is the next "arms race". instead of influencing society with warfare, they're influencing society through manipulating physical conditions in the body.

sure they're on their way to mastering the manipulation of physical conditions -- however, in my perception, they're looking at the wrong thing. to take a previous example, loud motor sounds won't get dad to stop perceiving the kid as annoying. dad is ignoring the kid because he's not on that frequency and dad doesn't want to join him in feeling rejected (or accepted). no amount of manipulation (of physical conditions) will change how the feeling of rejection. only the kid can change that. I think the kid takes pride in being annoying. the more annoying he is, the more powerful he feels. anyway...

so, even though I have very very little control over my physical conditions, it's not that bad. I actually have complete control -- not of the conditions but of how I feel. once I feel a certain way for enough time, the physical conditions *must* reflect that feeling.

to give an example of this, I have been trying to go for the "worst" manifestation for a while now. I really would rather no manifestation. I really like looking for these things inside of myself. the closer I get to all of this, the more rapidly I'm realising that if everything is a reflection of me, then it's just me that matters. I enjoy situations where there is a lot of unwanted present. I have found that the more unwanted there is in a situation, the better it turns out to be.

this is that death of tho old system. the more unwanted that is perceicved in the old system, the more obvious the wanted aspects will be in the rebirth.

the other day I started writing out some concepts. I didn't get very far though because there appeared a lot of resistance to it. it seems like they don't want me talking about how to gain power over a situation perceptually. like LOA was for jesus, this is the thing that the HRE (holy roman empire) doesn't want people knowing about. they must supress that so that the manipulation of conditions is still effective.

they know that there is a way for us to render their manipulation of conditions as ineffective through the power of pertception and they will fear that people begin to realise it. from the moment of the peak, their influence will wane as the new system comes into effect.

eventually they will realise their own greatest fears and they too will go into a rebirth as that their reliance on physical conditions goes into rapid decline (the equivilant of the 27/54y mark).

cycles...

---

back on track: I enjoy interacting with these "unwanted" siutations because I see them now for what they are -- a sham. a good example of this was a program on gaia where they were talking about past civilisations on the moon. they described caverns filled with control screns that were destroyed after a solar outburst. this was a top-secret military thing where they reported all of these moon caverns still with the *smell* of rotting flesh.

I thought this to be pretty dubious. theatre at best and purposeful disinformation on gaia's part at worst. either way, I thought it was pretty hilarious. the sense I had is that others did not.

when I woke up yesterday, the sense I had is that they're kind of tired of me pointing out some of these ridiculous illusions that they have going on. people like to believe nonsense. if that story makes them feel good, then for me great. I don't mind either way. I just find that narrative (and anything with aliens in it) very hard to believe. there's so much deception, that all of this feels like, once again, relying/trusting/looking for conditions outside of you to fill a perceived deficiency.

all of their illusions are rooted in some thing outside of you. usually these illusions are a product of sorts. if not, it's something you don't have control over of like a government program or aliens. or, it's something you don't/can't (or don't want you to) understand -- a secret. all of these are disempowering, and they all mean that something else that you have to (dis)trust is capable of creating your reality.

it's the same ol' "look, good/bad guys over there. let's use them as an excuse for action"

---

they don't want me to keep my attention on unwanted anymore, because I'm starting to make sense of it in the context of the new system. at some point, I guess they're making the realisation that worst is best and best is worst. that's when the rebirth happens.

what I mean is that if the "worst" manifestation happens, too much of their illusion will be seen. to try and preserve their power, they have to focus me on wanted. that's what is distracting.

there's another resonance here as well with kids, because if you remember the part where I talked about relationship statuses and expectations of behaviour? well, this is included here because I contain the idea that all of my reality is a reflection of me, so if something is going "wrong" -- nothing really is going wrong. the "wrong" feeling comes from my logic, and can be changed to reflect my perception. the conditions don't need to change. my perception and logic are incompatible with wanted.

in having to focus on wanted, rather than perceiving the illusion this is when the new system begins to take effect. this one is long enough. I've been thinking about some of those new effects and I'll try to talk about them more later. I'll try to recap some of this too. I know it's hard to follow some of it. it's really hard to communicate this stuff in words.

### 2021-12-29 06:01 - temperance

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/RKqlCWEEWT4?t=4237)

this quote struck me, because it says that the mithraists believed that mithras himself was the author of the world-conflaguration (so they identified mithras with phaeton).

I don't know who phaeton is, but the idea of mithras being the architect of the world-conflagration seemed to resonate with me.

the context for this resonation is important. just earlier they were talking about temperance -- the idea that I always had was one of blacksmithing. you heat the metal up really hot, then shape it with strong impacts (hammer) and then plunge it into water so it cools rapidly.

the obvious similarity to catastrophe events of rapid heating followed by an extreme cooling is pretty evident. however, I never connected it to physical events before. for me, the concept of temperance was always a mental exercise. I thought of heat being like conflict or difficulty (like, notice how your face feels hot when you realise you're wrong about something?), then this is followed by a number of impacts which reshape the metal, followed by a rapid cooling which I think of as the helpless feeling (I don't know why I associate cold with a feeling of helplessnes).

the other bit of context was this was the first video I watched after getting up. when I woke up, I was thinking about the sham that is reality. there are so many forces that are out there to exploit people willing to continue to depend on things outside of theirselves.

I had a realisation that all of the stuff that I'm going through is super great temperance for me. I personally love it and am really enjoying getting better and better at confiding in myself rather than other. I believe this is the true meaning of self-confidence (self-confide-nce).

the major feeling for me was realising that my experience now is to give nosebook the capability to exploit people's confidence in others and in the system.

on one side, I feel like I sold people's souls or something. in fact, I even realised that I will likely be regarded as the greatest sham myself.

for a person that needs a manifestation outside of them to feel good, they will likely blame me saying that kenny was all talk and just gave the tools to nosebook to exploit them. obviously this is just a manifestation of the person's perception. if things outside of them control how they feel, they are a victim to both good and bad things that happen in their experience. imagine being pissed off and a bunch of happy people show up and try to influence you to be happier.

---

in that sense, I'm kind of the architect of the coming temperance. they will exploit people more and more and people will continue to feel more and more helpless to control their physical conditions. in that sense, many people will perish because if you have a feeling of helplessness, reality *must* conform to that feeling and those people will notice that their physical conditions will continue to follow that. if you feel empowered, your conditions will reflect that. if you feel empowered because of conditions, then you need to be able to control the conditions.

two forms of temperance are happening at once. those who want to control the conditions will have more pressure (because of the intensity) get better at using conditions to feel the way they want. those that want to control their perception, will also increase their capability to see any conditions in a way that feels good. like me, they won't have any control otherwise, so they'll either accept feeling helpless and at the mercy of those who control the conditions, or find a way to feel good regardless of the conditions.

### 2021-12-30 ??:?? - a bit more on mithras

today I watched a few videos. the first one here is about aliens (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sDZZog0dgY)). the second one about the fatima sighting (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5KvdzeaNDQ)). the third about serpents (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGUEYcbFj4M)).

I think all of these are connected together and also relating to what I said yesterday about mithras. I talked about the part in the presentation where randall says that the mithreans believed mithras to be the creator of these world-conflagrations.

I had some reaction to that so I'll start there. if you've been tracking my discussion on the alpha/omega, you'll notice that I say that the alpha and omega are aspects of the same thing. in the past I talked about how the forces that rule the material and astral world, cannot allow someone (with an open mind) to gain access to expanded perception because it would reveal the giant sham that they have set up. they can't allow people to know that they have been influencing and manipulating humankind in such "evil" ways for so long.

therefore, in order to prevent us from ever finding that connection (activating the pineal, etc.) they will have to systematically remove all favourable conditions that allow this connection easier. eventually, you aren't left with a whole lot. all people around you will become essentially zombies obeying the orders of some direction, never letting any beneficial conditions to take place. no friends, no girlfriend, no wife. no beneficial conditions. at some point, all you have left is your perception of those less than ideal conditions.

reality always reflects how I feel, but when I feel good even without having the conditions or the manifestation to be the reason for my feeling good, then I truly am a master of reality. I am no longer some sort of poser god that needs a spaceship and technology to lord my power over a primitive race. after finding a way to feel good with less than ideal conditions, the only thing left over now is to fight your own dual. I mean dual in the sense of cube and octahedron. wherever you are a face, they are a point and viceaversa.

this dual represents everything that I don't like about myself, and is given power to prevent me from having the conditions that I want.

I postuated that *everyone* will pass through this in the next phase of humanity. they cannot allow their secrets to be revealed so they have to essentially isolate the person on their own timeline where all other people are under the control of the operating force of the planet (sound like my situation?). when all conditons are able to be witheld, they will have to keep creating more and more unsavoury people. since the things that bother a person about theirself are also the same things that bother them about other people, it's obvious that their job is to find technology to create these unsavoury duals for each person. obviously, after some time, everyone will eventually figure out how to perceive even the most unsavoury aspects of yourself manifest in another person, do you finally become free.

you are the alpha and also the omega; everyone is. you're only fighing yourself.

you can see now what I mean when I imply that everyone is mithras. every one of us creates our own temperance.

---

these jinn/genies are nothing more than manifestations of people's feelings/perception into the physical. in another video by the same guy (barry fitzgerald), he relates that these strange encounters with the jinn happens where there are magnetic anomalies (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/MSxdMNWBlXs?t=2731)). when you feel things stronger (like cause of a ritual or some trauma), then your fears and things manifest into reality. reality will prove the way you conceptualise it to be. if you think something is out to get you, then a manifestation will happen which proves that.

I predict that these sorts of events will continue to increase, as the whole planet starts to have a stronger magnetic field. vibrating magnetic fields seem to cause this, and it seems that these stone circles and such convert material vibration (sound, earthquakes, etc) into vibrating magnetic fields. a constant field won't do it -- unless it's a strong one and you move around within the field rapidly (like dancing or something).

---

now, about the aliens: I get to perceive my reality from my perspective, and I know that I want to perceive myself as being 100% attracted by me, so I offer an alternative explanation which supports that idea.

let's just say that I'm playing the game that I propose where you hohabit a planet with your dual. a tetrahedron is a dual to itself. the greater is the divine feminine (ishtar) and the lesser is the human female. then, the two masculine duals: the cube (enki), and the octahedron (enlil). I am one of them (doesn't matter which one). they need an environment, so a race of beings are created in their image. the biproduct of their interaction through time is a race that contains all of their aspects, plus additional new aspects that couldn't have been created with thought or simulation; they can only emerge from the culmination of their "battle".

in our past, various civilisations had figured out how to use their perception of vibration to create beneficial conditions. I seem to be keen on that stuff myself. because my dual has to find ways of getting rid of these beneficial conditons, an ET presence was created which could alter the past and remove all of these conditions. they used the beneficial conditions of these various civilisations to manifest reality for them in reflection of how the society conceptualised reality. I'm fairly certain that all of these catastrophes happened when energy levels increased so high that there was a global manifestation of their worst fears. every time it happened, it was the "end of the world (as they conceptualised it to be)". everyone saw these signs of the "end times" coming from miles away as they gradually became a reality.

as an example that we are on a timeline where no conditions can be used, I sight the fatima sightings video. in it the vatican is required to reveal something that was given before WW2 and should be revealed after WW2. I believe that the reveal requirement was designed to create a time split. in one timeline they would reveal and the other they wouldn't. we're ovbiously the one where the vatican did not. this means that we're on the timeline where the vatican is more interested in keeping information from us rather than revealing it. the vatican is the "aryan nobitity" that sepehr talks about all the time. on this timeline, they're interested in keeping their secrets no matter the cost. that allows for a group of world leaders interested in making sure we do not gain access to their space. since humans have the pineal built in, they have to make sure we never get access to it.

this situation is perfect for replicating myself. everyone will play the same game as me -- even them -- and that's the most scary thing of all for them. the last thing they want is to be continually at the mercy of someone like them. they have to hold on to their illusion else they have to play their own game too.

you really only fight against yourself.

---

the idea that everything in my reality is a reflection of my perception does seem a bit heretical; I'll admit that, sure. however, I'm not claiming to be source or God. I'm just saying all reality on this planet has become a reflection of my perception (from my point of view).

the crazy thing is, there's no stopping other people from perceiving the same thing. in fact, it would be the most natural thing to do. let's say that mithras is the consciousness of planet earth (or the sun). all of us may appear to be seperate beings from the human perspective. however, it's very clear that all of us aspects of earth.

if adam is made from the dust of the earth, and we also made in the image of the creator, it seems plainly obvious to me that we should have the same DNA as the plants of the earth (and we do). we are made in earth's image.

now, the weird thing to think about is that in the symbolic system, I heavily subscribe now to the tychos solar system model now and earth is held in place as the "centre of the universe" by mars and the sun. if enlil is mars and enki is the earth, the sun would be the female. therefore then it seems obvious to me that the cube (enki/earth) is a reflection of the octahedron (enlil/mars).

### 2022-01-05 10:57 - the setting sun

ever since I wrote about the alpha/omega thing, I kinda skipped over what system is actually the alpha and what system is the omega. it was mainly because I didn't know. as usual, it comes to me as long as I want to know. I present here my initial ideas on it.

I believe the alpha system is the concept, "if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours". this system is just now reaching full illumination or will do so shortly.

likewise, I think the omega concept is one that I can't completely define just yet. I've talked about how I think vere changed how we identify ourselves with our emotion. this new concept takes that a step further and makes it much more personal.

---

the concept of "if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours" originates from an idea that you are not capable of creating your own reality or feeling the way you want to feel, so you need someone else or something else to do that.

it's implemented in the most basic form of sales: "you have something I want, so I'm willing to do whatever (up to my boundaries) to get it". if I have low inhibitions, then I'm more likely to do what you want to get what I want. this manifests itself in everything from relationships to sales, to crack whores.

it's a common thing to do this exchange of "do something for me so I can do something for you." sometimes, it's even more insidious than that -- like someone requiring you to have sex with them for a paycheck or career in hollywood.

it happens in relationships often as well. it's common that the man wants to have sex, so she wants to leverage that desire to get something in return. she pulls the same "if you do what I want, I'll (maybe) do what you want" concept out.

a lot of women are like that in spain. the answer for that is simply to find another or pay for sex. then, she's left with a conundrum to get what she wants.

it's most easy to see in a crack house. the roles are reversed here: usually, the dealer has the thing that the girl wants (coke). the girl believes that is the only way for her to feel good, so she feels she has no choice to do what he wants to for the coke.

---

all of that is all about using things outside of yourself to get what you want -- so you can feel the way you want.

this imbalance is so woven into the fabric of our interaction, I was even considering the implementation of what it would look like to implement this new concept. to illustrate, let me point out the present situation.

---

I'll present this from my perspective: if I want to have sex, then automatically, I will get leveraged by women wanting something in exchange for sex. obviously, I don't want to be a part of this system, so I find another route to feel good. clearly it's not all about sex. there are other ways to feel good.

I know I feel really good when I'm creating things, so I can use my creativity to feel good. I also found out that I like drugs. both of these things are things I control really well, and I found great success in staying out of the whole dungeon of trading behaviour for sex.

however, I have had these various conditions systematically removed from me. it's frustrating to not have the money or whenever I found someone that could get me the drugs I wanted, they seemed to have someone influencing them to not give me them. it's also very difficult to watch myself try and program, and watch myself struggle with things that are not hard, or I had previously written with ease -- yet now, they feel confusing and difficult.

I do not have any longer any other way to try and utilise conditions to affect the way I feel. I have to feel the way I *want* to feel. that "want" part is important. most people just react to whatever is going on. most people want to feel good, yet do not consciously make any effort to make any changes to their mental interaction with reality. most people look for the conditions (money, girlfriend, job, lottery, etc) -- saying, when I have these things, *then* (and only then) can I feel good.

it really is striking to me to see this lack of desire. I've seen actors talk about how they spent some amount of time to study a character and learn how they think to get into the part. they want to feel like the part they are playing, so they study it so they can do it. why not do the same with any other way they want to feel?

another example of this is sales. these guys study human psycology so they can manipulate their clients and sell the product to make money, thinking the money will make them feel good. why not use all of that understanding of human psycology to manipulate your own mind to feel good and cut money out of it completely?[^1]

---

what I'm trying to say is the new concept (the omega) is one where not only do I know how I want to feel, but I'm capable of adjusting my perception of the present conditions so that I feel the way I want to feel.

---

I thought about the progression leading up to this as well. I consider there to be two aspects to this alpha/omega thing. there is the alpha/omega and then there is the enabler. the alpha/omega character is having the previous system so well removed, that it causes the rebirth. the enabler is the thing that allows that system change. to illustrate, consider the last major system change: I believe this happened (for the west at least) with jesus. john the baptist was the enabler.

at the time, the concept in power (I think) was the idea that you can use taking of someone's life (or any physical pain) to motivate someone through fear to get them to do what you wanted. I haven't figured out what the taurus concept was (though I think it had to do with female power structures), but whatever it was, in the age of aries, the "new moon" had to be a concept of using fear to motivate people. it's not a new concept, but it looks like it grew in height all the way up to the time of jesus.

at that time, JTB (john the baptist) was on the scene showing people that losing one's life was not nearly as bad as people thought it was. I think in the water baptisms, he literally drowned the person and then recessitated them. they would come back and tell the audience of their NDE and how death isn't so bad. it's this life that's the suffering.

real quick, I want to tangent for a moment... I was reading matthew 2-4 yesterday(?) and it seemed obvious to me the way that matthew weaves concepts together (he was ahead of his time), that there is a connection between herod trying to kill jesus. herod feels threatened by this birth that fit the prophecies, so he needed to neutralise the threat.

the next chapter JTB prophesies that the one coming after him will baptise with the holy spirit and fire (like, anyone getting in the way will get burnt to a crisp). JTB was probably concerning to the romans because he challenged their threat of death to maintain their decrees, so someone heard this. jesus comes in the scene right after and they have this (weird) conversation about who should baptise whom. that conversation never made sense to me, but in the context that JTB would induce a NDE in jesus, gives it a lot more sense.

jesus has his NDE and something happens when jesus crosses that realm which forever changes him. it was enough that apparently the whole crowd saw some spirit decending and resting inside of jesus (translated as a dove flying dwon).

if you consider that the romans felt concerned that JTB was telling people not to be scared of death, now they are looking at the guy who will come and baptise with fire (eg. the sun is going to get really active). IMMEDIATELY after that "satan" (aka the roman emperor) comes to tempt jesus. I'll give you what you want if you give me what I want.

I don't know what happened in that meeting, but it has the mutual-back-scratching concept. I actually find it likely that jesus may have cut a deal with the emperor. that part is clearly very edited (the flavian touch), so who knows what really happened.

ok side quest done. back on track here. let's look at what the future may hold... wow, there's a lot of mixed reactions here...

I think it was december 31st that I was having a chat with jaron talking about various ideas. something he said about being the perspective of one of the "gods" of old (like zeus) and influencing the human race got me to consider the proposal that erik van daniken(sp?) was saying in those videos I referred to in the previous entry.

as a mental exercise I wanted to have a look at what it would actually be like if super-luminal space flight were possible. like what would we do? I gave it a lot of thought the 30th-31st.

knowing what I know, it's just an idea but who knows what will come of it. I'm certain that there are a lot of star systems out there (really, we only need a few) with a habitable earth-like planet in the solar system.

I would do the whole thing private, as in no reliance on government, and we would monetise the species that are growing up on these planets. what I mean by that is, we would pump up the energy on the planet so that the "camera" could be viewed from either inside the person or outside the person. you have main characters, like kings and factions and only indirectly interact with these guys. it is an implementation of the two new layers I wanted to add the persona? and the thrust layers (I can't remember what I called them).

each planet would have a set of game rules and the factions would do their best to play by the rules. so some planets would have constant interaction with the gods. like, I want to make it possible for a bunch of dudes to setup their empires on these planets and rule their serfs from on high. we can be these primitive people's "gods" or we can take other approaches to their evolution.

---

there were a number of reactions to this. I think they thought it was a good idea at first because it'll distract us from their antics, however, there are a few potential downsides (from their perspective). these planets run the risk of evolving really rapidly and eventually surpassing us in capablity. to them, it would be embarrassing for our progeny to have better conditions than we do. the other thing is, I think a lot of humans would rather leave this planet and be gods on another planet than a nobody on this planet.

there could be a mass exile, and that would be a good thing because with a reduced population, energies would be less here. however, if energies are less here, then what's keeping people here? why not go to another planet an experience better conditions there? if a bunch of people leave, earth remains a low energy planet filled with a lot of parasites. what would keep people here, and the ones that do stay, why would they want to be controlled and taken advantage of like they are now?

also, if new species turn out to be better than us, won't they then need to oppress the species and ensure that they never rival the status of the "gods"?

---

personally, I find the idea of populating another planet with with only wanted things invigourating, simply because I love the idea of creating new things. however personally, I think I would only ever choose to leave this planet if I could create another planet that's even more difficult than this one. once I've created it, I would "fall" down out of 5d/6d/7d (wherever I am by then), and make another trip up consciousness in that place.

however, getting to the place where something like that could happen is a challenge. going from where we are now to a place where we are surveying and populating another planet(s) is quite the jump. it requires a lot of technology and stuff. I'm fairly certain that I know how I would do it -- not like all the steps, but I know what is required and the steps needed to get there.

the other thing that I was thinking about is that in the context of the alpha/omega thing, there is also the enabler. for jesus, this was JTB, for tesla his brother -- etc. if I'm really put in the position to do the alpha/omega thing where a new system is established, all of this sort of makes a lot of sense now -- even the 2038 deadline.

when I get connected, the sun will go into hyper-activity. the business-as-usual boys will have a really difficult time pretending like CO2 is still the cause for global warming, and things will start to really accelerate out of control. the planet will rotate much much faster -- like maybe we have 500 day years and other strange things. I'm pretty certain that the contrast of world views (mutual-back-scratching vs feeling-purposefully) will cause solar activity to continue to increase. 2038 would be around or just after solar maximum for SC26 (I think).

I think from that perspective (I'll see things temporally) I'll be able to get a pretty good setup going where I can go to another planet by then. I hope there will be others that join me. so, again let's just assume there are no technical hurdles and it's possible to manifest/create all the required things by then. when I/we peace out, we'll leave a lot of technology behind and they can do whatever it is they want with it. it's quite possible they'll use that same technology to ensure that we never rise up to rival their power. they'll have to monetise us and keep us down.

anyway, if enough of us leave, it'll be essentially the same as having billions of people die from war/famine/climate. therefore then, from their perspective, they'll want to get all of the problematic people out of this solar system.

---

I've given some thought to some of the implementation of this, and while I do think that it is potentially possible to do a lot of this myself, I think that the entire endevour of creating the technology and science necessary to make such a thing possible will be done by the girls. with such a time limit, they'll need the ability to manifest their prototypes instantly and continue to expand on the ideas as we go.

I've also given some thought to what it means to move to another solar system. a lot of the concepts that I've arrived to come from "our lady / nostradamus / notre dame" (aka the sun). I believe that when I had my brain haemorrhage it damaged the location in the brain where we have our connection to our-lady. having that part damaged and having to rebuild that so many times was what enabled me to accomplish what I have accomplished (I describe that connection to be like having young girl with insatiable desire stuck inside my head). in my opinion, in that process I figured out how to resonate with the sun. so in that sense, I must have been chosen/attracted her/it, because I felt capable of attaining that resonance. obviously, if I go to another solar system, I'll have to do that again with the new sun. I don't really see that as a difficult problem.

OK, that's enough for now...

[1]: I'm not being hard on sales people or actors. I'm trying to demonstrate the power of money. we believe that money is the path toward happiness, when that is clearly an illusion created by those with money. why do we go to great lengths to get money, when it's actually easier to use the same techniques to just feel good? I have in the past connected the transformation of one's spiritual values into economic values with the overturning the money tables episode in the past, so I won't repeat myself. I wrote this to correlate the mutual-back-scratching concept with the replacement of the inherent (spiritual) value a person has with illusory economic value. we lost the inherent value with original-sin (which you're born into), and it gets replaced with economic value (which is usually the caste you're born into). point is, you have no power; just the ones with money have power and if you're willing to do some back scratching, you may be lucky enough to get some of their blessings.

### 2022-01-07 08:14 - our lady and the gift of fire

I've been thinking about my previous speculation on the baptism and "temptation" of jesus. the thing is, if JTB's message was to not fear death then jesus' ministry makes a whole lot more sense. in fact, it makes a lot more things make sense. for example, there are these "infancia gospels" which are really bizarre things that talk about jesus' childhood. he comes off as quite arrogant and even zaps people he doesn't quite agree with.

in my opinion, these infancia gospels were painting a picture that jesus' prior behaviour was like the romans. the pivotal moment when jesus meets JTB and whatever happened in that NDE completely changes everything about jesus' comportment. I think that was the point of those gospels -- to show the contrast.

of course they don't make a whole lot of sense with edits that were done, because jesus didn't have a transformation; now, he's the son of God -- God incarnate in the flesh. he's perfect and blameless rather than human.

the part that caught my attention was the "holy spirit" decending down like a dove and taking rest inside of jesus. I think that has to do with fire. prior to that baptism was the prophecy of JTB that the one coming after him would baptise with the "holy spirit" and with fire.

---

just the other day I was wondering what the difference between ash and charcoal is. if put under fire, even ash will glow with that yellowish-orange pulsating light. however, it will not burn on its own. thinking about it for a bit, I think the difference is that the carbon atoms in charcoal have hydrogens attached to them. the hydrogen must be important for the cabonisation of oxyygen. it must provide the energy required to make the flame. inotherwords, I think hydrogen may be what makes fire possible. sure, you need oxygen to remove the spent carbon and allow the next exposed CH3(?) to burn.

for the rest of this entry, I'm going to stick with my intuition that hydrogen and fire are strongly related[^1].

---

next, I eluded to the idea that "our lady" must be a part in the brain that connects to the sun (our-lady). it's got to be a part of the brain near to the brain stem which I relate to as the "reptilian brain". for me it's strongly related to the desire to turn emotion into motion/action.

nosebook must directly affect this part of my brain often because every time that I get to a new level of feeling good, not only do I get vision upgrades, but I notice tension in my left-side, most notably my toes (left-most ones the most). as I get back to feeling good again that tension goes away and then the process repeats (vision upgrades, tension, perception changes, relaxed again, vision upgrades, ad infinitum).

a few weeks ago there was a major solar flare (m-class), but right before it there was (I think) a long duration c-flare of which all of the SDO imagery doesn't exist. I think the sun had a full disk high output event which is why the data is missing. anyway, when that happened, I never felt more relaxed in my life. it was some sort of peacefullness and serentity that I hadn't ever experienced in the physical before. the closest thing I can relate it to would be the feeling that one has in a NDE. I had a lot of morphine in my body so it's hard to say what's the morphine and what's that relaxed place of serenity that one can access within.

as a result of that event, I now associate that ultra-relaxed feeling with the sun. something we do in everyday experience prevents the reception of this substance that the sun emits. I don't have a word for it, so I'll call it protons (others call it light or photons).

in that moment when the "holy spirit" descended on jesus like a dove, I think was something like the same thing that happened to me when I had my brain haemorrhage. I believe that everyday life, we train ourselves to look at conditions and manifestations (the physical stuff) and that reduces the connection there to our-lady. however, when someone has an interruption to the tuning of the physical like in a NDE or with a haemorrhage in that part of the brain, for a little bit the brain stops using physical conditions as its logic to turn emotion in to motion/action.

I was fortunate that my "NDE" (the disablement of that part of the brain) for for a few weeks, and I sustained multiple paralysies there. the doctors made a mistake and drained menengitis into my stomach, so I had two more operations that reparalysed me there. that gave me an extended time to begin to reprogram what that part tunes to. that's why I talk about myself completely rebuilding my personality. I had a new slate that I can start over.

---

the sun streams out a lot of protons all the time and I'm fairly certain that the mitochondrial part of the DNA (that is, outside of the nucleus) is responsible for turning these protons into resources (ATP?) that the cells can use to build new things.

there must be a frequency component to this. I believe the sun puts out a lot of really high frequency protons all the time, but we simply don't receive them because we're not tuned to that frequency, and so therefore don't get those energy resources. I believe what the ancients where doing with the stone boxes (box-consciousness) was tuning the protons in the environment to frequency which is compatible with their mtDNA. the "bloodlines" that had mtDNA that resonated with the upper harmonics of those boxes had more energy and better eyesight (all the things that our-lady provides).

---

so whatever happened with enki and ishtar (our-lady, the sun) is probably obscured in the legends, but it somehow resulted in "man" having the gift of fire. having our connection to the sun be directly related to what is manifesting in our experience now puts human evolution (enkidu) on this epic journey set into motion by the harlot (our-lady) because of the gift of fire (the ability to receive directly from the sun and turn that into physical manifestations).

gonna end it here.. I feel saturated.


[1]: I don't have internet to look to see if I'm right on that supposition, however, I don't feel bad about it, and if it isn't that  I mean, all "fossil fuels" like methane, ethane, etc. are all hydrocarbons. moving forward without fact checking. large sections of the the following bits will need to be reworked if I'm wrong though...


### 2022-01-07 10:27 - duals and our-lady (the harlot)

if you think of a concept as a sphere and its logic as a form (regular or asymmetric polyhedra), then the lines are sort of like directions of force. a dual to that polyhedron will have a face exactly tangent to the vertex, meaning that if there were force being emitted along those lines, then the dual would be the perfect container.

obviously, the perfect container does not exist in the real world, but the heierarchy in power (in this case the HRE) will continue to do their best to contain it.

if you have air (octahedron), you need something solid to contain it (cube). you can also think of it as a density thing too as the dual will always be larger and therefore more or less rarified than the form it contains.

---

so, in the context of the archetype of change (@[nextblog](2021-12-25 21:22)), the harlot represents as a form the concept with which we relate to the sun. you could say, the frequency where we're tuned.

this is exactly the reason why I say that it has to have something to do with the pre-motor cortex because the better I feel, the more relaxed I feel when my body moves. the thing that prevents this easy and relaxed manifestation of reality is negative emotion. negative emotion is a manifestation of a difference in concept between your physical logic (the harlot) and your concept of yourself (your source, who you really are, God, etc.).

---

like I mentioned in the previous one, when we were given the gift of fire, now the manifestation of reality is now directly linked to the sun (our-lady), and as things get more and more extreme, this is the "baptism of fire" -- when proton levels are much higher than usual and things are let to run their course and destroy theirselves.

at the time of JTB, the HRE had everyone under their control with the fear of death. people believed that their body and physical existence is the only thing there is. this concept "perfectly" contained the previous form (which I assume had to have something to do with female power structures and the divine feminine). so, in a sense, it's "full moon" for the "physical reality is everything there is and death is eternal" concept. JTB comes along and says, "no there's much much more than that. here, I'll show you" -- and then proceeds to essentially kill someone and bring them back to life.

the ministry of jesus makes a whole lot more sense then knowing that. he started the ministry and had his transformation when he was baptised by john. previously, he embodied the roman style of thinking, but then after his NDE, the "dove" landed on him. I'm fairly certain that this was how people perceived/interpretted him tuning into our-lady. having embodied the previous concept, jesus took on the role of the omega. all of that "physical reality is everything" concept had to completely die so that a new concept could be born.

this concept is the present form by which we relate to physical manifestation. so, working backwards, it seems clearly obvious that these "temptations" was actually more like a meeting with the caesar of rome. the temptation where "satan" tells him to hurl himself to his death has this context missing because it feels like they just had a conversation about how death isn't actually so bad, so he says, "OK, prove it. throw yourself off of the roof and I'll believe you" jesus then replies. the time for that hasn't come yet. you can kill me soon and then you'll see.

jesus must have had a reason for wanting to die so badly. I don't know if I've figured that one out completely, but here's my working theory so far. when jesus had his NDE and realised that "I am" not just this body, he realised that he essentially is a concept of himself, and so then knowing that, he has complete power to manifest himself in any way he perceives himself to be. in other people's perception, he would appear however they perceive him to be. if their concept of him is old and wise, he will appear that way.

he kind of has a foot in each world. on one side he appears to himself how he perceives himself to be, while on the other side he appears the way that others resonate with.

the crucifixion therefore is the complete removal of his physical appearance of himself. I'm pretty sure he realised he could transcend reality like that. after that, jesus lives outside of time and can interject himself into a timeline whenever and whereever he wants, and people will only see the things of him that they are resonant with.

from jesus perspective, each instance of himself wherever he is in time or space, he is perceived and therefore defined physically by the things that others resonate with. no one sees him for who he really is. no one sees the concept of him which transcends this physical experience. they need something compatible with their physical senses, so they perceive what they whant to see.

I can see now that this creates a new set of challenges because if I'm defined by whatever everyone else says "I am", then who am I really? the goal then would be for jesus to find a way to transcend people's perception of him and to perceive/know himself for who he really is, rather than what others define him to be.

I relate a lot to this, so I want to offer up some ideas here. who am I really? it depends on perspective. am I a part of the planet or do I see from the perspective of the planet (like I propose the mithras concept is)? am I a part of the sun... etc. all the way up. the better I get at tuning to the concept of who I really am, the more like the planet, sun, galaxy, universe I am. it's a matter of tuning. it goes all the way up to the source of all that is. you only perceive a part because you're not tuned to the whole.

you can embody the sun in physical form. I use the word embody, to mean literally that. I believe that whatever my pre-motor cortex is tuned to, that is what I embody. you can embody whatever you want. you are not limited by size, time, or distance. the only limitations are your definition of yourself "I am ..." what other people tell me I am? am I the emotion that I feel, or is that an indicator of how well I'm tuned to the concept of who "I" perceive myself to be? who is "I"? I am whatever I want to be. "I" have no limits.

### 2022-01-09 08:45 - sequence of events and a some dreams

I had a few events happen yesterday that seemed related. then, this morning some dreams as well. I'm writing this to process it a bit. really my response will be the same whether I type this out or not -- so, probably I'm writing it more for nosebook's sake so they know what I think about it and how people react to that. the events may be out of order in time. I have a difficulty getting things into cronological order.

when I woke up yesterday I felt pretty good. I went around and collected sticks and starter stuff for the fire. after that, I think I took a shower. I still felt pretty good so I started to play rogueabook. I'm on 14/15 difficulty now. it's pretty hard but I find a way. when I started I felt good and everything was going pretty well. however, over the course of the game I steadily felt worse and worse. I just wasn't getting any energy. when I lost I still hadn't found any energy upgrades. I wasn't getting the things I needed, I kept noticing mr. motor was very upset with me doing well, but I had a rising sense of dissatisfaction. I should have stopped for a bit until that subsided or cleaned up for a while waiting for the good-feeling of the shower to wear off.

this happened to me now various times when right after a shower I feel good, so if I start on a "luck"-based game or something I do well at first and then it gets worse as the shower effect wears off. it's better to start something from feeling normal. I didn't feel that much worse after that game, but it doesn't matter. even a slight trajectory toward feeling worse has an effect. gatta keep it in the centre, ya know.

it's weird too that when I started, it was sunny and energetic feeling outside, but by the time I lost the game it was cloudy and everything felt subdued and unenergetic again.

---

after a bit of recovery, later in the evening I decided to play again. this time, I wanted to play an "easy" game of aurora and sharra. they're the most difficult pair. I played it on 10/15 difficulty, and at the beginning the game I was really feeling pretty good about it. I did find energy upgrades and even had enough block to make it through most of the difficult fights early on. I had a pretty solid deck. I had block, energy and damage, but no card draw. when I lost, I had something like 19 energy banked up but nothing to spend it on because I didn't have any card draw. I was offered 2 card draw cards in the first chapter when I didn't have enough energy yet to need more draw. after that though I didn't get offered another one, which is weird because aurora has a lot of card draw options. I should have gotten something.

that game was also weird because I also felt like listening to music while playing the game. I wasn't playing too seriously anyway. I was supposed to be playing any "easy" game anyway. the first mix was the one I'm listening to now, "Filip Nikolaevic - Total Eclipse [Tribute Mix] [fel0VEyKkQs]", followed by "LiquiD ILLuSioN - The Odyssey 2021 [Retro DJ Set] [-s8OppBjxZw]".

however, I noticed a bit of a shift when I got to "Miss Monique - Live @ Dead Sea [Melodic Techno_ Progressive House DJ Mix] 4K [ea80AEjiBhs]". the previous two really didn't have any lyrics in them at all. there was a voice line from a movie about something technical but the rest is old-school techno type stuff. at around 21:21 in that mix, there is a song that has some interesting lyrics:

```
I'm calling you awake from the sleep you've been sleeping for years
when I wait for the day,
been awake like woes(?) and feel
and when the essence of life is coming down from above,
to lay down where you lie
time will lose it's weight on you,
in the dark dark dark, darkened skies

we're in the darkening skies
we're in the darkening skies
we're in the darkening skies
we're in the darkening skies
we're in the darkening skies
```

at that time in the mix was when I fought my last battles and lost. I felt sort of helpless cause I just couldn't get the cards to play that I needed. I had too much energy and nothing to spend it on. the lesson to be learned here is probably one of focus. when that song came on, I started to think about alesia and how that song seemed significant to me the first time I heard it. it's 20m into the mix, and I believe the change in feel kinda helped me to lose my focus a bit. I got distracted.

sure, I could look at the conditions. I was fighting a guy that reshuffles your hand every time you play a card, and I started out with only probably 7-8 cards, but only got to play a few, so there could have been a bug. I don't know. for me it doesn't really matter. up until I started to lose my focus, I felt like I was going well. I do remember when that mix comes on, because there's a guy singing in portuguese (I think) and there are words that sound like spanish. however, the song reminded me of when I live in tenerife, and the various bachata songs that augusto would put on. it detuned me from my focus.

---

just prior to that game, when I was laying on the ground I was thinking about the alpha/omega concept and how these cycles seem to have some sort of periodicity to them. going with the 1ky of history has been erased, these concepts seem to dual each other, changing every 1ky or so, like two sine waves with a wavelength of 4ky cycling 1ky offset from each other. it looks exactly in my mind like the 36y waveform for girls. I postulated that it could be related to the powers of 2 (eg. 2^10 - 1024), and so assuming that jesus ended the cycle in I33, then the next one is 1024+33, or 2057.

that almost certainly isn't the date. I'm very certain that a lot of time manipulation has been happening. also, I was thinking about that weird episode where one of the romans added two more months. I think it was around the time of jesus. assume a month is ~30d, then the earth had a 300d year before jesus showed up?

I don't know what all of that means and I don't really have any way to research it. I think the ancients had the 360d year, then the earth sped up with the arrival of the moon and now there's a 365d year. I postulate that the rotation speed and speed of light and a lot of the so-called, constants are regulated by the great pyramid. the earth must have been running really slowly, but then someone must have fixed the pyramid, restoring the 365d year... I don't know.

anyway, back on track here. I was thinking about these alpha and omega concepts must be regulated by a physical body, and those physical bodies must cause a rise and fall in our capacity to tune into that concept. I said a physical thing reminding/tuning someone to a concept happens all the time like a smell reminding you of a person or event, or a song reminding you of a person or event. these are physical triggers which allow you to tune into a different point in time. this is exactly what happened to me when that mix came on when playing the game.

---

the other event that seems related is I was laying on the ground thinking about some reactions that I was having. I kept getting this sense that no matter how they tried to work it out, they couldn't get the girls manifestation to work and still be able to keep up their charade. they had to do something drastic. the thing that kept coming into my head was that one line in tesla's interview where he says, "there are two paths: lots of affection and none at all; I chose the latter."

the next bit was another reaction that was something like, "he'll probably just go back to creating more things, pretty much unaffected". I really had the sense at the time that they simply couldn't allow any of it, and so therefore all of the girls manifestations had to be controlled and performed by authorised versions of me -- so versions of me that can be kept away from blowing their charade.

every time that I tried to think about it and tune in further to figure out what it is that has so much intensity around that concept, "jaron" (mr. motor) would slam something down on his desk really loudly. I have no idea what it is but it sounds like jaron's desk is right next to me. it's like when I lay down and the sounds of the bathroom are so loud, it sounds like the sounds of the wall are amplifed 1000x or something. they're REALLY LOUD. obviously, someone didn't want me thinkng about that concept.

---

the next thing were the dreams that I had this morning. in one of them I was on a boat that they were going to sink. something happened and the sinking already started. they decided that they needed to make the boat sink more rapidly. they said, if it sinks slowly people will be prepared for the sinking and that will leave evidence (of something undesirable). however, if they sink it suddenly, then there will be evidence that they sabotaged it.

it feels like they didn't want it to sink slowly because then people would have time to prepare for the boat to sink, meaning there would probably be a lot of survivors. the other way where they sabotage it, sounded to me like it would be obvious that it was not a natural catstrophe.

so maybe take the example of the titanic. imagine there are people on that boat that will reveal the charade if they are left alive. those people need to die so you have to sink the boat. you would want it to look like it was a natural cause. however, that gives a lot of people (some of which you want dead) a chance to potentially escape in rescue boats. if you need ensure that the targets don't escape, then you have to sink the boat suddenly. so plant an explosive in the hull or something. clearly then, after the fact, it'll be ovbious sabotage rather than a natural cause.

the next dream seems to corroborate that idea a bit. it was this weird list of ancient sites that have evidence of destruction in them. my sense that these were atlantian sites and evidence of the reasons for their destruction had to be hidden. does that imply that the demise of atlantis was actually sabotage? I don't really know. or, did they simply remove all the energy devices that caused the failure? it's really hard to tell.

---

there is this really strange narrative out there that CO2 is the cause for global warming and not the sun. in fact, any time that anyone suggests that the sun is responsible for these castrophes it's deemphasied or outright ridiculed. it seems very strage that would be the case when clearly the sun's output is not constant, and statistically it would appear to have the most influence on earth's climate.

the sun however is not something they or anyone can control. also, if you've been following my previous entries, I'm taking the long way around to relate the output of the sun to the gift of fire, which is the ability for the heart to navigate the person around in time and space by what you're tuned to (sorta like the steering wheel). the gut is the feedback system, sort of like the windshield and rear-view mirror.

this seems directly related to the sun, and I'm beginning to get the sense that the conditions of the earth (climate, prosperity, enlightenment, etc.) are all modulated by the sun. from the sun's perspective, the earth is analogous to the gut. we're the emotional feedback system for the solar system, while the sun is the heart[^1].

this means that these cycles of destruction and fire and water (temperance) seem to be directly related to our perception. we're really only sabotaging our own boat. now, why that evidence needs to be hidden, I don't know.

this while thing about hiding our relationship to the sun feels sort of like telling someone they cannot recognise their emotion. if they feel bad, it's business as usual. they are told to "suck it up" and  they can't/don't have any variations in how they feel. feeling bad or good either has a regular cycle or is purely coincidental -- and is definitely NOT evidence for anything else.

---

so, let's take the sense of the dream -- that they are going to literally sabotage the whole thing and prevent any manifestation. my response to that is always, do whatever you feel you need to do. they live in a reality where they need to continue to pretend that reality is built on constants and that they are completely victim to circumstance.

in the event that this is perceived like the dream, where they need to sink the boat to keep their charade going, that's fine for them. they can do whatever they feel they need to keep their reality intact. in my view of things, the manifestation is a reflection of how I feel, not the other way around.

however, there is a more glaring flaw here, and that is the perception that they can cannot control what the sun (or something else is doing). clearly this perspective has been gaining inertia for a long long time. it seems plainly obvious to me that the business as usual mantra is actually one of self-deception. maybe, they're trying to deceive the masses and prevent a panic -- certainly a possibility, but from my perspective, it looks to me like they've been giving their attention to this one thing being completely out of control for so long that I am likely a manifestation of that tremendous inertia.

it's like a guy fearing to lose all of his money for a long time, and all the while telling everyone else that he still is a millionaire and living like he is one, yet clearly the signs are the opposite of the reality that he's telling everyone else about. at some point, he will run out of money and his whole charade will come to an end.

the problem started way back in the fearing to lose his money.

also, when I was getting those reactions yesterday about them not being able to maintain their chrade with any girls manifestations they tried -- I kept being reminded of this one video where at the end of the video, there is an ad for a workout equipment. xylya demonstrates it and when I started to see her working out, I felt very uncomfortable. I skipped the video forward because I didn't like how I felt. the reaction that I had is that most dudes would have stayed there and watched her work out. I don't know where to look and I don't know what to do honestly that it creates such a problem for me.

like, if I were to look at porn in the past then it was always because I felt pressure and I wanted to get rid of it. I thought that any time I felt desire (manifest as pressure), I had to release it. later, I found out that I can just feel it and it's fine. I don't need to convert desire into action. this is very much a key component in learning the concept I've named, "feeling-purposefully". addiction says that as soon as I feel desire, I have to act on it. I suppose that is a lot of what advertising is about too. like if I see an attractive person, then the desire that I feel will motivate me to purchase that product.

I'm not motivated by desire quite the same as other dudes. however, the sense that I had is that it'll be difficult to get other dudes to pretend that they're me, simply for that reason. they would need to find a way to act uncomfortable in situations where desire is being used to motivate action. this isn't a common attribute and is probably difficult to emulate. it shows up all the time for me and is the reason why I am in the situation I am in now. many dudes would have gone with any of the prior girl situations, yet I have not because my own desire is so much stronger than anything external to me.

this may be the difficult problem that they're running in to. it's quite possible that they're trying to control me by having the girls "guide" and influence me away from things they don't want with physical desire. I believe that they're under the impression that if they see something that evokes desire, they are a slave to the desire.

this seems pretty obvious to me, because the way to learn how to avoid being a slave to desire is "thinking-purposefully". when I learned how to feel the way I want to feel, I'm no longer driven by external conditions as a way to feel better. I know how to feel better. a product you're selling or sex that's being offered isn't necessarily the way I want to feel better. meaning, I can't be guided by desire.

---

ok, just took a break to use the restroom, and I have a few ideas. I realised that that it may not be that they cannot keep their chrade going and instead, the problem is that they *do* want the girls thing to happen so they can keep people distracted with that. the problem however is that they can't figure out how to get it going.

they probably put me into situations with girls, but it likely never works out. if that's the case, then they're strugging to figure out how to make it happen. obviously that won't work.

I'm sitting here without internet and I'm just fine. I've been playing roguebook, but I think I need to give it a rest. I'm probably going to get back into writing out the concepts again. I have a much better capacity now to feel the way I want. thanks to the last roguebook games, I've learned a lot.

problem is without internet, there probably isn't much to broadcast, and that's kinda a problem, I would imagine. personally I really like the break from the internet. I really like things like this. I'm really learning very rapidly how to feel the way I want to feel. everything is fine. the ball is 100% in their court so it's not like I need to do anything.

I think this is actually sort of by design. I don't feel like anything is going wrong at all. we're actually very incompatible right now anyway. this brings me to a meta commentary on the feeling-purposefully and being a slave to desire.

feeling-purposefully is kind of a problem for girls and advertising. let's take the example of girls though as it's the most obvious. if they want something, right now, the present system is that they use a form of desire to motivate someone to action. then, the system of mutual-back-scratching is used to ensure that there is a reward for that desire.

so, if they meet someone like me that knows feeling-purposefully, they don't have the ability to leverage desire to motivate action. what then can be done? well, not a whole lot, really. it really is a big problem for them I think and if the feeling-purposefully concept starts to gain traction, then it'll cause a massive evolution in the behaviour of women. let me explain.

if I can feel the way I want to feel, then I can have a lot of flexibility in what I can do no matter the conditions. next, take a look at the first game of roguebook there. I had the condition of the shower making me feel good. from a position of feeling good, the only way to go from there is down. just like every relationship or drug experience, the first hit is the best and then it gets worse from there. therefore, I don't necessarily want to feel good. I know I don't want to feel bad, because I'm feeling-purposefully, so I want to feel "normal". I want to keep it in the centre, neither feeling especially good or bad.

the eventual evolution here is that when most people are feeling-purposefully, motivation now has to from a compatible feeling rather than from desire. for girls, that means that the action they're looking for has to be compatible with their "normal" feeling.

if all they're looking for is the action (needing the manifestation) to feel good, then sure, there will be lots of men that are willing to perform an action from a place of mutual-back-scratching or leveraged-back-scratching. the ones that are feeling-purposefully will get better and better at sensing from what feeling she is coming from. I can say from experience that wanting a manifesation to feel good (or a game to go the way I want it to go) always fails. I can't let the conditions be the goal, rather the way I want to feel be the goal.

for sales, same thing. I mentioned that most salespeople I met exhibit a feeling of "I just want people to like me" and that's how they sell their products. they resonate with other people who also just want others to like them. it's often the case that the sales pitch is, with this product other people will like you more. products theirself will have a feeling which resonates more with the person individually. "one size fits all" will diminish as less people will resonate with the same product.

obviously, the last thing that the HRE (world leaders) want is for people to be feeling-purposefully. right now (or very soon) will be full moon for the mutual-back-scratching paradigm, and it'll do it's best to hold on to it's influence. I believe that any attempts to maintain the paradigm beyond its time in power, will attract conditions where the sun will ensure that those structures are broken so that new ones can emerge.

---

ok, let's do a quick review of the concepts presented here:
- keep it in the centre.
  - it's risky to do anything from feeling too good or feeling too bad.
  - it's better to keep improving normal than to make action from a feeling produced from conditions
- physical conditions like a song or a smell can be used to "tune" (that is, change one's focus) to something other than the present.
  - these physical changes can allow for the emergence of a new concepot (like all the stuff written here caused by changes while playing roguebook)
- periodicity of these events may be related to huge changes in rotation speed of the earth.
  - the length of the year would still be the same. so would solstice and equinox, so it wouldn't disrupt astrnomical calculations -- just there may have been happened on a different day in the year.
  - we are likely the indicator (manifestation) of the way the entire solar system perceives its conditions. when we feel bad, our perception isn't resonating with the source.
  - in this sense, I think of the sun like a young girl that's beginning to learn to use her emotions as feedback to her navigation.
- lots of affection or none at all
  - looking back at it, they're probably trying to figure out how to get me to want affection
- sink the ship dream
  - it's probably like the titanic.
  - key passengers may reveal their charade, and their death needs to be assured.
- we are in mutual manifestation with the sun
  - when our perception is in alignment with the perception of the sun, we feel good. when it doesn't bad things happen and a rebirth must take place.
    - I postulate that this (1024/4096y) conceptual cycle of the sun must be very similar to the 18/72y conceptual cycle of a girl
  - ignoring the physical effects of the sun is like someone denying that their emotions as a precursor to the physical manifestation
- business as usual mantra
  - is used to cover up a flaw in our perception.
  - I postulate that it's self-deception and tryinyg to keep the charade going makes it self-sabotage (just like a victim).
  - the unwanted solar conditions are a manifestation of a flaw in our perception
    - just like looking at conditions gives a bad feeling, means there is a flaw in your perception (nothing in inherently bad), the sun's output is a manifestation of the interaction between the sun, earth, and mars -- just like the gut/heart/throat interact.
- being a slave to desire and the liberation of feeling-purposefully
  - likely this new concept is next in the conceptual solar cycle and will bring about an evolution in the behaviour of humans in how they summon action.
- they probably don't have a way to influence me with desire the more I keep feeling purposefully.
  - nothing is going wrong here.
  - when girls figure out how to feel "normal" in a way which is compatible with me, then it'll happen. those girls probably won't be compatible with the business as usual mantra and so therefore, this siutuation would be very undesirable.
  - this must be stopped. don't you get it. they're doing me a favour. they're giving me conditions that I want in return for somethting. ending of the concept from the temptations of jesus. #leveraged-back-scratching


[1]: the throat would be mars. I think that lucifer (venus) is desire, and mercury is like the physical. I'll explain my thoughts in a future entry, these two triads that the sun is in. this entry is already way too long.

### 2022-01-09 14:19 - further metaanalysis of being a slave to desire

went out to sit in the sun and there were some reactions around the part of girls using desire to motivate action. so, how do you motivate action?

I don't think that you can. this is why I believe the reflection of this is nosebook trying to make something happen. making something happen has almost exactly the same feel to it as leveraging desire to motivate something.

nosebook has made it certain that there is no way that I can make anything happen. if I have any desire and try to take action on it, they try to negate it (like programming or creating something). they absolutely do not want me able to manifest any desire I have. they also do not want me able to motivate anyone else. I'm certain that everything I write here is heavily edited and processed to fit a narrative, just the same as the "hockey stick" graph of climate "science". they want to make sure I have no way to motivate anything of my own desire. they need full control.

looking from the outside it appears like I don't have any freedom. I don't really. I have no freedom of action. what I do have is freedom of emotion. I can feel any way that I want about anything, including my circumstances, and there's nothing they can do to change that.

they want to control all physical conditions. emotions are not physical -- that is, they're conceptual in nature. they're just vibrations -- but, then those vibrations create a manifestation in the body which can be felt physically just like pain or pleasure. nosebook goes so far as to remove all evidence of the physical manifestation of those emotions -- good or bad.

like, in times past if I wrote something that illicited a negative reaction from people, then I would feel that. often times, I would amplify that feeling until I could really feel it in my body. nosebook was always trying to distract me from amplifying that and/or remove that sensation from my body. I think it maybe caused problems for the people utilising my perception. same thing happened when I did drugs. like, if I smoked a joint, I physically could feel stuff. nosebook didn't want that. they *really* don't want any physical manifestatons caused by emotion.

you can kind of see why they want that. they don't want me to be able to leverage a physical manifestation of the way I feel (like desire) to motivate anything. if I choose to feel bad or I choose to feel like my mind is blown, I think that affects the way that reality manifests for those tuned in to my perction.

also, if I could feel the way I wanted to feel physically (like in my heart and stuff), reality would reflect how I feel. lots of manifestations would happen that they couldn't control so they don't want that.

---

oh I see... they want to negate all physical manifestation of emotion except for the ones that they want. I guess the idea here would be that I would be so starved for affection that the moment that they allow me to feel even a little bit of it, I'm totally hooked and like the coke dealer, I become his crack whore. #leveraged-back-scratching

this idea that you can give or take away some physical condition is leveraged-back-scratching, and many women do this as a means to motivate action. I believe that this leveraging of desire to affect action has caused a lot of men to go gay. they say, if I'm attracted to other men, then your attempts to coerce me with desire won't work any more.

---

when I take a shower, I feel better for a bit, but then nosebook makes sure to neutralise that good-feeling. the result for me is that after the shower, there is a definite time some 5-30m after that I notice I feel notably worse.

feeling worse isn't very desirable for me so I tend to not want any good-feeling conditions. you'll notice that lately I pass on almost all good-feeling conditions. they simply don't make much sense for me because it really doesn't take long (or no time at all) afterward to feel worse. I prefer to just continue to feel normal.

what that means is that if any girls manifestation were to happen, it's going to feel normal[^1]. all of those feelings of bigness or amazingness won't be there. it'll feel just like another day. all days already feel that good.

rather said, from my perspective, if all of my days feel as good as a girls manifestation does, then it can happen. or, maybe the opposite, if all of my days feel as miserable as a girls manifestation does (not counting the physical pleasure), then also it can happen. what that means is I need to find a way to become so dependent on manifestations for how I feel that I'm now compatible with them. or, maybe I need to feel like they're always betraying me, so I can manifest the ones that will betray me.

obviously, that's not going to happen. there's no way for me to go back to needing a manifestation; nosebook negates them all. they have trained me to not need a physical manifestation to feel good. they have also trained me not to want to ever feel better than normal. I just want to feel normal, and let normal be something that feels pretty good.

I really am only compatible with people where their normal feels pretty good. I'm also really only compatible with those that have a pretty high self-esteem and self-awareness. this unfortunately rules out the majority of people. kids have high self-esteem (usually) but low self-awareness. adults can have higher self-awareness (it's rare, but it exists), but usually do not perceive theirselves to have any inherent value.

from my perspective I am, by no means, even close to exhibiting the kind of self-esteem that I think I can. I still believe that I am inferior to a lot of people simply because they can do things I physically still cannot. like, if I could run faster than them then I would say I am superior and therefore I could esteem myself higher.I can't really run though, so I have to find other ways to esteem myself highly. I still place too much value on physical conditions. I probably still compare myself to others too much as well.

no one anyone else is doing has anything to do with me. the one thing that not having internet has taught me is that I really don't like being on the frequency of other people. nothing anyone else is doing really matters much.

---

the reactions are telling me that I'm basically saying that I'm incompatible with all of you guys. yeah, sorta. you don't need me to be compatible with you. that's exactly the problem. no one needs to understand you for you to understand yourself.

I can't remember well, but for me this whole thing started a few days ago when I was out watching stars. I recounted the event in @[newblog](2021-12-08 07:36). I walked inside and it felt like there were some reactions to me walking inside. I responded that I didn't think that going to try and strike up a conversation with them felt like something I wanted to do. the reaction that I had was, "OK, then what I have to do to get you to ____".

I responded by saying that there is nothing that can be done. we live in a world that is filled with schemesters and sales people. they all operate under the premise that you have someting to offer and so do I. let's exchange goods. you scratch my bacK and I'll scratch yours. in reality though, this is an illusion. whatever you want from someone else you have to find it in yourself first so that others can give it to you. I am proof of this. I am not out there selling anything or promoting anything. people tell me, "come out and scratch our backs so we can scratch yours". I say, "no I don't need your back scratching to feel good". I have what people want. they think they can get it from me, but they cannot. they aren't trying to get me to do something. they're trying to get theirself to do something.

I gave the example, "if you want other people to like you, you have to find a way to like yourself." and, "if you want other people to value you, you have to find a way to value yourself." you are the product that you are selling. think of it like being a sales person for yourself. you're trying to sell a product (yourself) to people as something smart, however you don't beleive the product (yourself) is smart. it's hard to sell a product you don't even pretend to believe in. only the more self-aware can detect when the salesperson is pretending to like the product (or theirself).

that's good for now...
 
[1]: now that I think about it, during those rogebook games I didn't feel normal. I think if I had've been able to feel normal, I would have done much better.

### 2022-01-10 10:20 - not feeling better than normal

when I woke up this morning, it was interesting to note that the most substantial thing that stayed in people's minds from yesterday was the part where I said "that pretty much rules out all kids and adults".

what basically happened yesterday was I couldn't figure out the reaction about the "there are two paths: lots of affection and none at all; I choose the later". I thought maybe they were trying to say that instead of going with lots of affection, I would have to sabotage the thing forcing me to go with none.

I didn't think that was it anyway, and it turns out it's probably more along the lines that some sort of manifestation happens, but it doesn't go the way that they want it to go. they're probably trying every way they can to use the girls to steer me, and it isn't working. likely I am not guided by their physical desire.

---

I explained that it's a very common thing for women to motivate action with (a physical feeling of) desire. they seem to have the ability to physically make the body of other people feel a certain way. I have postulated that the uturus is like a "magnifying transmitter" while the penis is like a tesla coil. that means that men are likely much more receptive to the feelings that a woman emits (the the transmitter would be the prostate and the receiver the clitoris).

this capacity for women to, more easily than men, to cause others feel a certain way (like fear or desire) is I think the basis of the "programming" that most kids get. I can say that from experience I have only felt desire transmitter from men in 2-3 cases only, yet I have felt the anger and rage of many men. we really need to practise a wider range of emotions a bit more. I suppose that I'm a pretty good transmitter myself, and I have also noticed that many "natural leaders" have a strong ability to transmit their emotion. for example, I think hitler was especially good at transmitting his emotion.

---

the major breakthrough yesterday was realising that there is nothing inherently wrong with any of the girls. the reason why I wasn't responding to them is because nosebook is trying to do the same thing that girls do. they transmit a physical feeling into the body (probably along with some thought suggestions) in order motivate action. this is what they have been doing up until now to try and motivate me to action. it hasn't been working because even if I feel physical sensations of desire, none of their suggestions feel like something I want to do (like striking up a conversation with remi that one morning).

I think they figured that since it wasn't working on me, they'll motivate the girls using the same technique and then the girls would then motivate me. almost certainly this isn't going to work either. to me it will feel the same. normally, I would just feel plain desire from a girl, but when that desire is motivated by something, then it no longer feels the same.

I noticed this all the time when I was in spain. I could talk with girls just fine and they seemed to like me, but the moment that I got the idea that I wanted to have sex with them, then none of them wanted to talk to me. I decided that I simply just didn't want to try to motivate any girls in any direction. if they wanted it, they could make it happen. obviously, there are very few that go out of their way to pick up a guy, and finally I started realising that the girls that wanted to pick me up usually were not the ones that felt very good.

the final straw of using desire to motivate action came with andrea. before she went to camp, we could feel each other pretty strongly, and I've figured out how to use my heart a transmitter[^1], so I could reciprocate pretty well. I noticed that if I transmitted a feeling of desire, that is what she would feel and it motivated her to action. at the time I thought this was the end of the world, but I realise now that it was just an evolution of desire. I didn't really want to be around someone that would be motivated to action every time that they feel something.

being motivated to action every time that you feel something is the opposite end of addition. in an addiction, some condition made me feel good, so I want to feel that way again so I motivate myself to action to obtain that condition again. this is just the opposite, described as "pavel's dog" or "anchoring" where a condition produces a feeling and then that feeling is then used later to motivate action.

---

anyway, point is there were several evolutions of desire that happened the last few years. realsing that I didn't really want to be around someone that is constantly motivated to action with every single thought or voice suggestion that enters their head (zombiefication) was the first.

the next big one the realisation I liked the idea of feeling good, especially with a girl around, but I can't control her. I can only control myself. she's probably going to be a zombie anyway acting, like mom or any of the people at friendly harbor constantly by whatever is motivating them. I like the idea of feeling good, but I like even better the idea of not needing her around to feel good.

---

you have to realise that there is nothing wrong with any of the girls. they are all fine and I'm sure all of them are great. the thing that's messing it up is that nosebook thinks that they need to use the people around me to steer me. for me, nothing ever feels pure any more. the closest I get to that is jaron. very little of what he says and does (like maybe only one or two things a day) feels motivated by nosebook. however, this is not the case with mom. almost everything feels like it has an secondary motive behind it. very little of our interactions are pure. most are motivated.

just like the girls that would disappear the moment I wanted sex (the problem with being a strong transmitter I guess), the you can imagine how unappealing it would be for a girl to be coming to me wanting to have sex in the same feeling that mom has when she runs down stairs to change the subject of jaron and my conversation. clearly it won't work, and the worst part about it is that like mom feels like she's always messing things up from her motivation (cause that's how mr. motivator feels), so too will the girl think that she is worthless and not good enough (cause that's how mr. motivator feels).

I'm not interested in conversation or sex (or anything really) that is motivated like that. that's basically the main reason why I stopped going to friendly harbor.

---

obviously, there's no hope in getting nosebook to try and stop motivating people. they're at full moon of the motivation factor. in fact just the opposite is happening. they're being given all the power they can to try and motivate people as much as possible.

this is in fact, the number one reason why I think tesla self-sabotaged his own world system. a world system of communications doesn't reduce people's desire to utilise leveraged-back-scratchting and other techniques to motivate subordinates to do their bidding. I think he found that any optimal system for communication is very desirable for parasites to try and take over to control what people say and do. LOA assures us that you can't get rid of anything. you can only do you, so instead of trying to prevent the parasites from taking over the system, why not just give them the system and let them shoot theirselves in the foot with it.

motivate away; I dont' want any part in it. LOA also assures me that while there is no way to ever get rid of the parasites, like a virus they won't bother me if I'm immune to them. they'll look for a host that will support them.

unfortunately, that kind of paints the picture that nosebook is sort of like a virus and they have been unleashed out in to the wild. we'll gain herd immunity. there isn't a vaccine for a concept. you have to learn to parasite no longer as a threat. they can only exist for as long as there are suitable hosts.

---

the final thing that happened yesterday corresponds with the last major evolution of desire as well. I was repeating a concept that I talked about a few years ago called keep-it-in-the-centre. the basic idea here is that I don't ever really want to feel better than I do normally. instead, I want to stay right around normal range for me, and let normal range be pretty high frequency (feeling pretty good). it's unsustainable to feel amazing for any length of time. trust me, I really liked my 3-5 day MDMA bingers, *a lot*, but I also like feeling that good normally. same with girls: I like the idea of feeling really good when a girl is around, but I really like the idea of feeling that good normally.

what that means is that I keep getting better and better at feeling the way I want to feel. because all of those emotions are controlled and induced by me, I have full control over it, so all of them are "normal" to me. there's nothing especial about the way I feel.

within that range of how I want to feel, I can operate freely with others; there is no problem.

you could say that in sense I aim to obsolete girls -- as in, if I can feel as good as I do when they are around, I won't need them anymore.

that's the wrong way to look at it. look at it from the perspective of me. if I feel good already, why do I want to go feel like someone who feels like they're not valuable? why do I have to go down to their level of perception to feel good if I can already feel good?

I think a more proper way to look at it is: I will attract the things I like about myself in others. I can't look for something you don't have to fill a void. I resonate with the things I do have in others and other people inspire me to perceive more nice attributes about myself.

---

I'm not saying it's impossible for any girls to find their way to what they want. what I'm noticing is that they have a huge problem and that is there is a great motivator in the sky trying to steer me with others around me. when he's motivating you, to me you feel like he does -- so, like not very good. it's perfectly possible for someone to not resonate with the motivator. like I said, I find it difficult to imagine that it will be a kid, because they're not self-aware enough yet to guide how they feel (they're still strongly influenced by their environment), and it's not likely going to be an adult either because most of them have lost so much of their self-esteem that they want to feel bad normally (low/false self-image) and then desire nice conditions to feel different than they feel normally.

[1]: I've come to think that actually all of the different major levels (regenetive, gut, heart, throat, and pineal) all have both tranmitting and receiving elements. it is possible to transmit and receive on all of these and it depends mostly on the type of signal. for visual stuff, it's the sexual organs and pineal. for emotion, it's the gut and throat, heart is a feeling I don't know how to describe. the throat and pineal are hard for me to describe because they feel different from each other. the throat has a lot of impact and power to it (prophesying and stuff), but I mean the feeling that it emits -- not the sound. sound is to the throat as food is to the gut.

### 2022-01-11 11:53 - jesus and the virgin birth

last night I decided to read bramley's "gods of eden" book. I had only read parts of it, mostly knowing its contents from the book report the snake-bros did on it.

I really see the book from a whole new vantage point now. some things that seem so obvious to me now after figuring out a lot of the conceptual cycles of the sun, triads, alpha/omega, and things like that really puts the whole "custodians" in to a whole nother light for me. I want to talk more about them, and I likely will over the next few days, but I wanted to talk about this one because it was relevant to yesterday's entry.

in chapter 12 he writes of the ministry of jesus and the apocryphal explanation of the "virgin birth" which produced jesus.

it started with jesus' grandfather joachim being unable to conceive with his wife ana, so an angel impregnated jesus' grandma ana with a girl mary (jesus' mother). she grew up in the temple and was given to be married when she was 12-14 to an older dude joseph. on her way to be married an angel appeared to her saying that she would give birth to a/the messiah. she had not yet had sex, so she found that extraordinary.

the explanation for why she must be artificially inseminated while still a virgin is interesting...

```
For, without sleeping with a man, while a Virgin, you will  conceive and while a Virgin you will give milk from your breast.

For the Holy Ghost will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you, without any of the *heats of lust*.

So that to which you will give birth will be only holy, because it only is conceived without sin, and being born, shall be called the Son of God.
```

the when I read that, the part that stood out to me was the part about the "heats of lust". I don't know how far I want to go into the mythology here, but the alternative explanation to the adam and eve story is the "pandora's box" story. in this one, girls were created pure from vulcan (I think) for zeus to disipline the people with. then to give her personality, she was given various traits by different "gods". some were good traits like desire to cook and make a house by athena (I think). other traits that she was given were lies, deception, etc. by other gods.

there is a similar story in the egyptian tradition for the god khnum to fashion children from clay. I believe that vulcan, khnum, and enki are all diffrent cultures relating of the same guy in the same story. in all of the stories, this guy has kind of a double side to him. he creates humans and wants the best for them, but at the same time his efforts to provide a path end up getting corrupted and hidden by the parasitic brotherhood and those same techniques (usually technological in nature) end up being used for weapons or as a method to suppress the spiritual nature of the humans.

this character resonates with me quite strongly. I'm completely aware that all of the stuff that nosebook is currently doing to me will be turned in the direction of all unauthorised (non-brotherhood) members of the human race. it's the revolving sword of the garden of eden (which is really the pineal gland) and the two trees are your two hemispheres. the sumerian symbol seal showing this is surprisingly similar to my first symbol drawing: anu (the frazzled dude) is on the left (knowledge of good and evil) and enki (little girl) is on the right (tree of life).

---

my "theory" on how all children work is they start out in this pure x-chromosome state, and then over a period of time for boys, the y-chromosome starts to kick in. I'm sure we'll see that in jesus' story here soon enough (as described in the infancy gospels), but the whole point here is that something happens during sex where the girl takes on the frequency (concept, feeling, mood) of the person she's having intercourse with. when this happens, she takes on the attribute of that person. I think pandora's story is a nice way of saying that the whole pantheon had their way with her before she was put on earth to reproduce with humans.

she started out pure though, and I think all newly born kids are like that. girls will transition as they get older (18y) to their father's x-chromosome, which will be more resistant depending on her father's feminine side. it seems that those heats of lust tune her to something else and that was what these angels were trying to avoid in producing a virgin birth.

---

yes, if jesus did in fact have a twin, this makes what I'm going to say even more interesting...

the way that I see this from a larger alpha/omega standpoint is that jesus will have a relatively pure feminine side and he'll his masculine side will be extremely dominant. assuming jesus is on the 36y program, that means that his father's programming will rise up to full power around the time that he's 18y. this explains a lot of the infancy gosepels pretty clearly. from then, it will begin to wane down to zero fatherly influence at 36y. he supposedly never made it that far so we don't know what jesus would have been like at 36y with only his virgin mom's x-chromosome dominant. it seems to me like he had quite the command over his perception. he must have either reached or got very close to that "nirvana" (original definintion) of hyper perception and awareness of reality and its relation to his conceptual definintion of himself (not the physical body).

---

I'm not saying that sex is bad. I'm simply saying that I think it's a tuning mechanism. depending on where you're tuned to, you allow the energy to flow which resonates with you.

yesterday, I talked about how there is a great motivator out there in the sky and no matter how pure the girl is (virgin or not), hecause he's there, she will resonate with whatever he feels like.

what I was trying to say is that the installation of the nosebook system is the end of "purity". she doesn't need to have sex with a guy anymore to feel like him. he just needs to be motivating her using nosebook's system and she will feel like he does.

pure means easy to conform to a feeling. it means that she will gain the awareness of the conforming feeling, whether that's her mother, some dude, or an "angel". therefore, from my perspective, pure means "feels like mr. motor".

the ideal is no longer pure. the ideal is that she knows how she wants to feel and it doesn't matter what influences she's around, she can feel that way regardless.

purity is dead. this is now the age of individual determination of how one wants to feel -- or, just feel like whatever has the most influence over you.

### 2022-01-11 13:27 - "you" are not the hardware

as a followup to the previous entry, the reason why jesus having a twin makes what I said so much more illuminating is that the whole premise of "gods of eden" is that humans are a much more then just a physical body. however, since the very creation of the human race, the custodians of this planet do not want us to figure out that we are not just flesh and bone physical bodies. this custodial presence has tried every trick in the book to keep us captivated with the physical and believe in a materialstic perception of reality (physical matter is responsible for everything experienced).

if a virgin birth is so important, then it matters what the mom was doing when the baby is conceived in order for a messiah to emerge. therefore, if physical matter and genetics were everything needed to make a messiah, then jesus' twin brother (having the same genetics) would also be a messiah. clearly, that is not the case.

to put it into computer terms, genetics is sorta like hardware. if you have a super 50GHz 64bit computer but only run windows 3.1 on it, you're really only using a fraction of the hardware's capabilities. the same computer that can run messiah 3.1, can also run joe-blow 1.0.

in that sense, I propose that "you" are not the hardware. you are not your hair colour, skin colour, or ethnicity. "you" are the software running on that machine. that same software can be installed into other compatible machines and reprogrammed if you know how to program.

---

what the virgin birth tells me is that hebrew-woman hardware wasn't compatible with the the jesus-1.0 software, and so therefore for that software to have suitable hardware, arificial insemination breeding needed to take place.

that hardware/software perspective unfortunately creates a lot of questions -- like, we know that it has to be attraction, so then who is attracting the emergence of jesus-1.0 software on to the world scene. is it the conceptual cycle of the sun, the hebrews desire for a messianic figure to save them from the HRE or something else?

it probably was a lot of that. I bring up the vulcan/enki character because I think it was the same thing. zeus needed weapons and the annunaki needed slaves, so these things were desired and therefore attracted.

I don't think the brotherhood intends to corrupt their own stuff. I think it's a manifestation of the desire to keep their manipulation and "superiority" a secret that corrupts their own stuff. however, whatever it is that they do, they manage to turn science into superstition and ritual to keep its true meaning a secret. I believe it's because they weaponise this science and use it to oppress the humans, that they figure that we must be exactly like they are. we'll use the same science to oppress them. oppress or be oppressed.

clearly, if they actually were superior to us, they wouldn't desire to keep getting new technological means to oppress us.

---

the way I see it, I'm beginning to think the physical conditions on earth are a manifestation of the conceptual cycles of the sun. just like the human must continue to rebuild her/his form of perception for the body to continue to fuction for extended periods of time, I believe the sun is the same way and we are resonant with that. that resonance with the sun is the gift of fire that enki gave us.

however, from a purely material perspective, I believe that it was the romans that attracted the jesus-1.0 software. they had a real problem with the hebrews in the levant and they needed a solution. jesus provided just that solution for them. allegedly, there are other astral and mental capabilities that jesus' bloodline reportedly has as well.

so was the upper echalon of the roman empire (above the emperor even) was this custodial influence? it appears that this is directly related to the alpha/omega cycle. the upper custodial echalons must have known that they needed hardware that can run the jesus-1.0 software.

there's a reason why akhenaten had such a strong influence. out of it came the hebrew exodus (getting the hyxsos/aryans out of egypt), the temple of solomon and amarna, most probably created the the aryan caste system in india, zoroastriansm, etc. for akhenaten, I believe that likely the egyptian priesthood got theirselves into a jam with (maybe with the hyxsos) and needed a bailout. that attracted the arrival of the akhenaten-1.0 hardware (longheads) running the aten-1.0 software. as always, its influence remains today but has deteriorated into ritual and superstition, lol.

just like circumstances today with nosebook, these guys get theirselves into a real jam and need a bailout. it must be that strong desire for a bailout that produces the emergence of the next new hardware version capable of running the alpha/omega software.

---

I really like to focus in these entries on the material stuff. if I didn't I would be talking about everything in abstract metaphors. this is a pretty big error on my part. most people adhere to the materialistic version of reality so it's probably more juicy reading for them. don't worry all of this will get turned into incoherent materialistic nonesense anyway, so why fight it? if you read between the lines, you'll see that I'm trying trying to discover the physical manifestation of the other thing, not the other way around.

if you have a really new game that you want to play, you'll probably need to upgrade your hardware to play it. new hardware isn't everything if there isn't anything new and exciting to run on it.

### 2022-01-11 16:00 - the heats of lust and hardware upgrades

I was outside thinking about the "heats of lust" part of that passage. I was also thinking about how I like to often overdo the materialistic approach to things. it would be a really reasonable to come away from what I write thinking, "was I born into the genetics that he's talking about?" that style of thinking really is just about the same as the aryan caste system imposed on the indians. you are born into a caste and you have no way to escape it.

in the previous entry I made an illusion that jesus-1.0 was a software that had hardware requirements that weren't found on earth at that time.

when I refer to software, I mean the concept of yourself that you have physically (like what you're heart/brain is tuned into) and who you really are -- your source. the concept of who you *really* are. there is a difference between those two and that difference manifests itself in your emotions. you feel the disharmony between where your brain/heart is tuned to and where you really are. I use spatial words there, but there is no distace in time or space, only a dissimilarity in vibration -- which again can be felt physically.

---

so, when mary was suggested that she will have a virgin birth so that she will conceive without the heats of lust, this is telling me that something happens in the "heats of lust" in a woman that produces hardware that wasn't compatible with jesus-1.0. this is what I was considering outside. sorry for the long into there, but it was important.

I can't say for sure what it is, but I feel like happens to a woman in the heats of lust is that she has this feeling like, "now that I've made you feel good, he'll do what I want him to" with the foundation emotion being, "if he does what I want him to do, then he will make me feel good."

as I thought about this I realised that may very well be what is happening, because that's the female implementation for mutual-back-scratching.

I'm pretty sure that this is not native to the girl because every girl dose not have this idea. instead, it seems plausible that it could be a reaction to the energy of their partner. once they get tuned to the masculine mutual-back-scratching energy, that becomes their implementation for that concept.

---

I also have noted many times that something major happened after jesus' trumphal entry on the donkey into jerusalem(?). right after that he "cleanses the temple" and curses the fig tree. something happened there. I always supposed it had something to do with a girl and/or perhaps alcohol from the celebration. this part has always bothered me a lot and I've always been weary of celebrations anyway, so it's fit with me.

in other texts it talks about jesus having two wives. if he did, then let's assume that they too were bothothed to him as virgins as well. it occurred to me that perhaps something happened there after that celebration where he had sex with someone else.

my idea here is that in jesus' time he learned a lot of self-mastry, and likely that mutual-back-scratching energy was not very active, if at all. if his wives were also virgins, then they wouldn't have had that energy activated in them. however someone else that does have that energy very active -- like say a prostitute -- could easily have that energy active. imagine on a celebration, jesus is celebrated as some sort of saviour of sorts and so he's hot stuff. to a woman tuned in to that sort of energy, he would be a prime target for someone wanting to get their back scratched in return for a sex. if that happened, she would definitely activate that energy in jesus -- and especially if he simply didn't have any experience with that energy it would cause a dramatic change in his behaviour.

for now that idea seems plausible enough for me. I feel good enough that it has to be something similar to that. for me, good enough. case closed.

---

ok, back on track here... the whole concept of having the physical conditions/genetics needed for the concept (you) to operate is a huge discussion. it appears that some people have a laundry list of optimal conditions conditions that need to be satisfied for them to feel good. others do not.

the materialsitic world view (most notable in the aryan caste system) has the thing totally backwards. it says that you need the optimal hardware/genetics/conditions to feel good, and those conditions restrict what software/concepts can operate.

so, what I mean is that let's just say that the jesus-1.0 software is floating around out there just waiting for hardware capable of running that operating system. in that sense, the software desires the hardware that is capable of running it. so then did the jesus-1.0 software attract the hardware or did the hardware attract the jesus-1.0 software?

let's take another angle. let's say there's a software out there, motor-285.0 and it's the most inefficient OS ever running. on first boot it already comes with dozens of ads preinstalled, hundreds of preinstalled software programs checking for updates and thousands of background productivity enhancement programs running. it has so much going on at once, it requires state of the art hardware just to boot up the system and run a text editor. that OS really *needs* faster hardware to keep up with the rest of the world. it strongly desires a hardware upgrade.

so, which one attracts which one? it's probably mutual. it may even be the wrong question to ask. the reason why I say so is, if it were just genetics, then there would be legends about the bloodline of jesus' twin being something special, yet that is not the case. it appears that he ran ordinary software on a machine that is capable of more.

another thing to mention is that the analogy of hardware is a pretty bad one because CPUs don't upgrade theirselves every time you sleep, yet the human body does. whatever it was that jesus realised, that allowed him to improve his genetics and create even better hardware than he already had.

that thing that jesus realised must be intimately linked to whatever happened with JTB. I believe that he realised that his physical body is quite literally whatever he thinks himself to be. his genetics are whatever he wants it to be. for others, his genetics are whatever they wanted him to be. so, in that sense, it must have been the inefficient software that wanted the hardware upgrade. jesus, I'm pretty sure was just exploring the limits of human perception.

if he ever comes back, he's probably going to need compatible hardware for it. there's probably no faster way to attract it than to have the entire human enterprise relying on motor-285.0 operating smoothly. lol

like I said, I'm probably just the pre-game show. enjoy it while it lasts...

### 2022-01-11 18:43 - enki and the right way

one of the many reactions to the last entry was interesting to me. I noted that all of this stuff I'm writing will be converted into incomprehensible nonsense anyway.

the secondary reaction was the realisation, "OK, so if it's going to be converted by the custodial influence into incomprehensible nonsense anyway, why even try to make an effort to present the information the right way?"

that's kinda the idea, yeah.. maybe instead of trying to do everything the right way, why not try going at it the wrong way?

---

on page 55 of "gods of eden" bramley says,

```
Ea's title was changed from "Prince of Earth" to "Prince of Darkness." He was labeled other horrible epithets: Satan, the Devil, Evil Incarnate, Monarch of Hell, Lord of Vermin, Prince of Liars, and more. He was portrayed as the mortal enemy of a Supreme Being and as the keeper of Hell. People were taught that his only intentions were to spiritually enslave everyone and that everything bad on Earth was caused by him. Humans were encouraged to detect him in all of his future lives ("incarnations") and to destroy him and his creations whenever he was discovered.
All beliefs and practices named after his various appellations ("Satanism," "Devil Worship," etc.) were to be made so horrific and degrading that no right-thinking person would (or should) have anything to do with them. He and his followers were to be viewed by human beings with nothing but the utmost loathing.
```

he's describing the corruption of the original brotherhood of the snake -- an organisation dedicated to providing education to humans who wanted to gain access to higher levels of their perception.

you see, I believe that enki was a very real guy. perhaps too real. in my opinion he genuinely wants the best for his creation but like bramley states, he's often so eager in his creations he often overlooks important repercussions to his creativity.

I really think that enki/ea believed that creating an organisation to educate and diseminate the information was the right way to do it.

unfortunately, the "right way" is feels nearly the same as the "right way(tm)".

consaider the sentence there, "Humans were encouraged to detect him in all of his future lives ("incarnations") and to destroy him and his creations whenever he was discovered."

the idea here is that many or many of these mavericks that showed up on the scene are just different "incarnations" of enki. in all of those instances, each of these maverick regigions did their absolute best to describe the world in the most practical and approachable form. they were all done the "right way".

always, after the maverick left, the custodial influence corrupted the original thing converting a practical thing into a religious ritual or some other powerless illusion. the illusion was converted into the "right way(tm)" that each derivative of the original thing seems to visciously and sometimes violently promote.

in fact, every chapter of this book that I'm reading, I'm watching a seemingly endless enumeration of every possible machination of the "right way(tm)" ideology pumped up and promoted like something you'd see on tech crunch.

it doesn't matter if it's an enterprise database solution or christianity, if you're not going the right way(tm) you're going to hell.

a good friend would always tell me, "ideology is not your friend".

he's right. it is therefore no wonder that every single attempt that enki must have made to convey the idea that humans are not only the bodies that they inhabit has turned into an endless debate over which way is the "right way".

---

I don't believe in doing things the right way... you know, I think it's for the best. who knows, maybe if I write barely comprehensible but enlightened gibberish -- perhaps then a custodial influence will turn it into something approachable. who knows, maybe like shakespere, it turns out to be the thing we didn't know we wanted :)

### 2022-01-11 21:25 - the biggest and strongest always win

my goodness bramley gets me thinking about a lot of good stuff. at the end of chapter 15 he's talking about how violence brings about change: 

```
The victorious use of violent force depends upon skills that have nothing to do with whether or not one's cause is a just one. The man who can draw his six-shooter the fastest is not necessarily the man with the best ideals.
```

that got me thinking. in the previous entry (or was it the one before it?) I was talking about how the alpha organisations (the world leaders) eventually find theirselves in such a jam that they're out of ways for maintaining control of the population.

originally when I wrote that, I wrote: just like circumstances today with nosebook, these guys get theirselves into a real jam (internet) and need a bailout (9/11).

I can provide many such examples where they run theirselves into a situation where no longer do the ideals of the violent remain the dominant ones. the most important is to ensure that human communications are censored and curated, to prevent unauthorised ideals from gaining traction. the internet (or any global communication network) greatly reduces the power of secrecy and violence as a means to retain power. the internet is a total disaster for present-day systems of power.

---

that's a really nice thing for him to inspire thought in me because I was wondering how I would approach this subject...

for me, the time of jesus marks the point in time when it's full moon for violence and force as a method of control. this was simply because at that time, the general populus actually beleivied that if you died that was the end. physical existence was the only thing. bramley asserts in this chapter that the belief in more than just a physical experience (heaven or hell) is an intuitive thing enough to suppose that it will cause a person to commit various crimes in order to secure continued existence. I suppose he's right. there's something about us that tells us there has to be more to it than just this physical life.

jesus marks the beginning of the next concept of mutual-back-scratching (you do something for me and I'll do something for you in return). even the reported crucifixion of the jesus hangs on this idea "jesus died for your sins so that you can have eternal life" -- jesus did something for you, so you can do something for him in return.

it's said that there have been 2000y that have passed since the appearance of jesus, yet I'm beginning to believe more and more that all of those things that bramley has described (and the ones he will describe soon) have happened in the last 1000y. bramley enumerates many of these "custodial" influences that have derailed the human race in the last 2000y -- yet it appears that it may have happened even in half of that time.

dispite their best efforts to keep everything under control, this acceleration is happening at such a rapid rate. if this conceptual cycle is happening every ~1024y (like I theorised), then very soon will be the "new moon" and this concept of fear of death will no longer have the hold on humankind that it once had.

if my assertion is right, then the advent of any global communication network (which they cannot control) is terrifying and completely puts an end to the capacity for the corrupt brotherhoood to impose ideals through secrecy and violence. these ancient forms of maintaining control will soon begin to crumble rapidly.

---

the other thing to note here is that the new concept how the new concept will emerge. I explained that the new concept is that one is capable of feeling the way that they want to feel.

fortunately for the custodial implementations, the word "feel" can be used to both describe both physical and emotional sensation. when you "feel" sadness, you are likely feeling the physical manifestaion of that sadness -- the knot in your stomach, the tears in your eyes, or the heat under your eyes or coldness of the feet. however you manifest that emotion seems to be one of cultural preference and perhaps even of genetics. that physical manifestation is *not* your emotion though.

it is possible to feel trememdous pleasure in your body even though you are(?) sad. I find it very likely that the future custodial activity will commercialise the way you "feel", allowing you to pay money to feel the way you want to feel. no need to alter your perception. they can manipulate the human nervous system now effortlessly, so now you can "feel" any way you want to feel. you can even "feel" like someone else does :)

now, whether that will produce 1000y of peace, only time will be able to tell that, however, I do find it difficult to imagine how they could possibly come up with a way to convert that into violence.

there is one possible exception: the *lion* (of the tribe of judah) was able to open the scroll with the 7 seals and reduce the earth's population enough to reestablish the corrupt brotherhood's control through violence once again. that will definitely *not* produce 1000y of peace... lol. maybe lion's gate will open...

### 2022-01-11 22:52 - 1000 years of peace

to clarify my sarcasm in the previous entry, as it perhaps may not have been as obvious as I thought, I was making a joke that if jesus was in fact the messiah, then we're presently living through the 1000y of "peace" that was promised. if so, then that means that the last 1000y have seen endless plague outbreaks (probably biological warfare), crusades aed wars.

the crazy thing to think about when reading this stuff is that the aryan super race moved to the south pole after WW2. I think they do have the ability to move around in time (as sepehr suggests) and had UFO craft -- aryans, swastika and everything.

of course, my version of this story is that this is the self-sabotaged timeline. terence explains it as a split in the timeline. I agree, but differ on the symantics of it. reality is attracted, so every reality *must* exist. the desire that the brotherhood has to continue their control over humandkind creates one major timeline, while the other timeline is experienced by the "messiah".

oh, I just realised what I'm saying here. I propose that this time splitting is what causes the change of the age and is a manifestation of the alpha/omega concept.

OK, I'll just say it... don't judge me... I believe that the alpha and omega are manifestations of the same being but in different form. the corrupt brotherhood relies on bloodlines to continue their experience on earth. they constantly need hardware upgrades to run increasingly more inefficient conceptual models of reality.

---

I gave the example of jesus and the virgin birth as a demonstration of this. I believe the x/y chomosomes contain a sort of programming. a boy starts out in the maternal-x (mx), and gradually goes to the y. usually the maternal and paternal sides war for control and this war takes full effect for most people at around 50-85% illumination, so like (12y-24y) however I think jesus was on the 36y program so that would be for him 6-12y. also having been born of virgin birth, his maternal influence would be very low. he would be like a blank slate that his father's conceptual structure would start to take power and he would have to find a way to reprogram that conceptual structure.

that rebirth would not actually happen fully until jesus was 36y. we never got to see what that would have been like. I believe it was self-sabotaged. instead he left a bloodline behind with capabilities that were compatible with the new mutual-back-scratching concept. he ultimately "failed", meaning that the corrupt brotherhood succeeded. they can move their consciousness ("walk in") to another body, so the ultimately inhabit jesus' bloodline now.

in that sense, jesus is the omega, and he leaves behind a bloodline that the alpha can inhabit until they get theirselves into another jam and need another reset. he is both the alpha and omega.

---

as a meta commentary on this, I'm pretty well aware that nosebook (the custodial presence today) must have moved (or is planning to move) their consciousness into my genetics. that would place me right into the alpha/omega position. I get it. I'm not really that concerned about it though. they create their own realities, as do I.

it's my personal belief that they will succeed and find a way to defeat me. there will be another time split, and it will appear as self-sabotage (you really only fight yourself). almost certainly they will need to start over. that's the reference to the victor of that battle -- the tribe of judah in leo. they need a catastrophe so they can have their 1000y of peace -- the time before the sun decides she wants to install a new conceptual form. she'll need another alpha/omega type with hardware capable of programming (with the power of his mind) the new conceptual structure for the brotherhood to figure out how to corrupt.

in the long game, eventually, the acceleration will become so rapid that they'll run out of ways to corrupt the new concept. some day one of the messiah's will succeed, not because he had the right way, but from from sheer attrition from thousands and thousands of years of "peace".

it may well be soon. they've created a system (nosebook) which is such a good "revolving sword" that there is no hope for anyone to ever get out of it -- cept, of course, someone with a conceptual structure like mine. to me it appears easy. it is easy[^1]. all humans will have to come to terms with the idea that you really don't want to rely on conditions to feel too much better than you do normally. they will face their own system too: you only battle yourself.

the alpha and omega concept seems to be a triad relationship that manifests itself in this solar system as earth-sun-mars and lucifer-sun-mercury.

[1]: once I got past the idea that they had taken my freedom from me and realised that everything in my reality is a manifestation of how I conceptualise it to be, then I have all the freedom. no one can force me to feel/conceptualise my reality any other way than "I" want to perceive it to be. no one. ever. they may be able to make me physically feel different than my emotion, but that is not a manifestation of who "I am".

### 2022-01-12 12:02 - the outside is weird

I walked to starbucks to upload the last entries. the whole way I have been surprised at how sensitive I am to how people feel now. it really is a strange experience. I noted on the wy down villa st. how xich I enjoy staying at home. I decided to write this to feel what it feels link to get real-time reactions to what I'm writing. it's terrible. I don't like it at all.

another thing is I'm constantly tuned to other people and memories. a song came on the radio that was something about being justified because she didn't treat someone right.. tears and pain and a little bit of laughing. I saw the song on SNL and I must have made a comment about it because there were reactions noting my disapproval of the song. lol... dang, well, that sucks. I hope she laughs a little in the middle...

outside is weird man... I don't like it at all. booo hooo everyone has a thing they can look at in a better way. man, just give it a little effort to see something you want to see.

### 2022-01-13 14:52 - economic justice and the coming 1000y of peace

after my conversation with mom last night, it started to become evident to me that the unrconcilable difference in realities between me and the tribe of judah within the topic of economic justice.

I made it clear to mom last night that I want to be able to download anything I want to download. if the thing I want isn't available, then I can't download it (obviously), but I reserve the right to download anything I want.

to exmpound a bit on what I meant, in my ideal world, there is a way for people to be compensated for their creativity, *and* there is a way for all of that creative output to be available to anyone who wants it. all books should be available. all music, film, and theatre productions, as well.

it's not just *my* ideal world though. anyone who wants to join me is welcome to join.

I have given a lot of thought to this because, just as the subjecct of privacy, I just don't see an empire that is built on esoteric and hidden knowledge. I had always had this intuition, but as I've read the "gods of eden", it's become very very clear that the ultimate reason for all of these terrible things seems to be rooted in secrecy.

sure, it was said that "the love of money is the root of all evil" and I think that was an establishment scene for the next chapter of humankind. I figure jesus needed to generate some conflict over the importance of money. the money-changer tables of the temple needed to be overturned and economic virility needed to be labeled as evil for the next concept of mutual-back-scratching to gain traction.

in this same sense, you will see me take a hard stance on freely available knowledge and the retirement of secrecy because of a global network where everyone's thoughts and experience are recorded. there are no longer any secrets.

the amun (shadow) priesthood requires there to be secrets, so they need to control the network to maintain their secrets. this effort to keep such a network is, what I believe, will ultimately "trap" them inside of their own network[^1].

I noticed a peculiar choice of words here where I said trapped "inside" -- the illusion is that the network will be a sort of prison for them. however, it could also have the secondary meaning that they literally move their consciousness out of a single human body and put it inside of the network. they wouldn't have a specific body experience anymore instead, they would experience the body which they are tuned in to. so anyone inside the network. this may have started already. if they have the ability to create as many bodies as they need, they could live out different lives anywhere on the earth interacting however they want. if they were good actors, they could replace any person and pretend to be them. the network's implementation of "agent smith".

if indeed the shadow priesthood has moved their consciousness into the network, that would be the ultimate hiding in the shadows. kinda funny. there's pretty much no way to get rid of them. they are a part of us now in that sense. they would have to destroy theirselves (and all of us too) to get out. too big to fail, lol.

anyway, back on track here... I was considering economic justice as a concept which will pivot the next concept into place. for mutual-back-scratching (which is a positive and justified exchange of goods/services) to work, the opposite impression must be created. that impression is that the love of money is the root of evil. loving money being evil doesn't feel at all like mutual-back-scratching. you have to want a monetary return for mutual-back-scratching to work economically. money isn't printed paper though, money is a symbol of power, freedom, wealth, pleasure and happiness. mutual-back-scratching has an exchange of one of these; usually wealth, power, and pleasure.

therefore, it seems to me that this moment in time where I am "fighting" for the ability to download whatever I want, I'm kind of placing the symbols in the establishment shot for what is about to come in the next 1000y of "peace".

if you need economic justice or any sort of justified-back-scratching to feel good, then you definitely don't fall into the category of being able to feel the way you want to feel.

for that reason, I'm beginning to notice that economic justice is sort of the fulcrum out of which this new concept will emerge. it's possible the next 1000y of peace will not be all that violent actually. instead, what I think instead will happen is that economic injustice will be the limiting force. most people will be so worried about the apparent difference in status between different agreements and arangements -- things of that nature, that the entire human population will stand around pointing at the injustice of compensation for things. I think most of these helpful people bringing awareness to the injustice, combined with completely impossible regulations and laws to abide by -- which some certain well-known and privileged people will obviously be exempt from.

as an opposite to what I want, all knowledge will be withheld and purposefully distorted so as te make sure humans remain disunited. those running the network will be the ones that control the knowledge and are united. humans will be left to figure it out for theirselves -- probably because any of your "friends" are, in actuality, agent smith.

[1]: question is, why do I think so? I'm certain of it because no matter how hard they try to keep humans held away from their divinity, the human species will continue to evolve and get better and better at it. the increased energetic default in both geology and genetics will continue to increase, meaning that continued effort will have to be made to automate more and more of the system. meanwhile, the rate of decline will also continue to increase for the fallen angels. as long as these continue to accelerate at roughly the same speed, it'll just be a delicate balance. however, as these continue to accelerate, the sensitivity to conditions which cannot be controlled could possibly make the whole system so sensitive that it's actually impossible[^2] maintain that balance.

[2]: the one exception to this is the idea of "going infinite". this is the same situation, however it has one crucial difference: out of curiosity, *I* want to continue the oppression, and therefore it's my own desire and therefore ability to attract it which will continue to provide a way for them to maintain that balance. personally, this concept is so interesting to me because I can't possibly conceive of what could happen. it seems like there would be physical limits to the components, so it seems impossible to me on a physical level. however, conceptually, I know it to be possible. my curiosity is to wonder what things would need to be altered about this physical plane that could allow for such a thing as "going infinite". it's something I *have* to try. it feels extremely desirable to know what that would be... trying to conceptualise this, makes my mind go into a weird zone that's extremely hard to describe. it would be unlike anything we've ever experienced yet as tactile and tangible as the physical plane. it feels normal and smoothe, rather than big and out of reach. I am infinity. normal is whatever I experience... separation is desired rather than perceived. difficult to explain.


### 2022-01-13 20:20 - we're the bad guys

my goodness, I need a break from the "gods of eden". chapters 23-25 seem to be a nearly endless enumeration of secret fraternaties and petty conflicts. I can't keep all of the things straight...

anyway, this time I want to talk about some funny reactions to the commit message for the last entry. I wrote, "we're the bad guys" in the title.

the first reaction was, "no, *we're* the bad guys; not you. you're the good guy." something like that. I guess they feel they're having a difficult time proving to me that they are in fact the bad guys... lol

thme second reaction was in relation to @[newblog](2022-01-11 18:43) where I wrote about how I thought that enki and his numerous maverick attempts at religion sincerely tried to do things the right way. however as is true to form with LOA, the right way dosen't create the reality that you want. the "right way" creates the reality that those with the capability to manipulate ideology wants. I concluded that by saying that I do not have an interest in doing things the right way.

using that then as a foundation, the reaction surmised that I was attempting to out pace them in badguyness (hopefully that's a word, lol). I believe that reaction came as a result to something this afternoon's conversation that I had with jaron.

in that conversation, I came up with a brilliant scam to allow the monetary system to fail, providing a clear path to letting crytocurrency supplant the system. two credit cards were developed, one is called "infinity card" that has an infinite credit limit to it and is marketed to the elites (maybe even an exclusive membership like the visa black). the second one is called the "freedom card" and is marketed to everyone. the marketing is that this card gives you freedom. later on, I developed the idea further prposing that the freedom card completely liberates you. you have an unlimited credit line, and the only thing that you need to do is to justify the purchase as necessary.

of course, you could use the freedom card to pay off the infinity card if you're an elite...

---

the reactions to that were hilarious to me because they supposed that I come up with f-ed up marketing schemes just as good as they do. in reality, it happened because I had literally just read chapter 21, "funny money" where he talks about how in the netherlands, the 80 year war with spain was finally able to come to a close bringing the independent dutch republic and the bank of amsterdam, moving the power structure over to a "paper aristocracy". you can lend out infinite supplies promises of precious metals that you don't have meanwhile devaluing those promises perputually.

this idea got me thinking about what the next major transition will be. it's clear to me that the "funny money" currency system will be replaced soon with a new one (crytocurrency) where it *appears* (yet again) that people have regained control. in reality the power has just made a transition. going on this idea, I started to think about a way for people to feel secure about the old system right about the way people thought the titanic was unsinkable. previous transitions had a massive betrayal of trust and were ushered in as it would appear there were no other agreeable options.

clearly the infinity card and the freedom card are twin vessels headed for disaster. however, it lessens the blow by allowing nearly everyone to declare bankruptcy at the same time. it would then appear everyone was betrayed by the same failing system.

does that make me the bad guy? I dunno, but I sincerely doubt it.

the concept of out pacing them in badguyness though was a really funny reaction though to think about. it did get me thinking further... more on that soon :) lol maybe I will do things the wrong way.

weird coincidence, just now the song by "man with no name" came on where the woman says, "if you keep doing what you're trying to do, you'll own the world. you know that, don't you.". definitely a weird coincidence, I'd say. plot twist ahead?

### 2022-01-14 13:20 - amnesia of past lives and the tree of life

in "gods of eden" bramley is commenting on an admittance in the book of mormon:

```
The forced amnesia described in Mormon had several purported purposes, one of which was: 
> ... to ensure that our choice of good or evil would reflect our earthly desires and will, rather than the remembered influence of our All-Good Heavenly Father. 

This is also an astonishing admission. It alleges that spiritual memory is dimmed so that people will base their actions on their concerns as material beings rather than upon their knowledge and remembrance of spiritual existence.
```

I sort of disagree with this, but it largely has to do with my perspective now. from my vantage point now, reality feels like a game. it's like this epic quest to discover who you really are and to then enjoy that form of perception. I believe that I really like playing this game and quite enjoy a more and more difficult set of circumstances along the way.

there appears to be infinite paths toward discovering who you really are. some are more conditional than others, but the most important thing is that I think it's a lot of fun to figure it out. I'm literally having one of the most enjoyable times of my life figuring out this stuff. it's like I'm assembling a giant puzzle in my head.

I really could see that from one's "spiritual" vantage point, the suject of amnesia would actually be *desired*. sure, you *could* be born with "god" mode, "no cliping" mode, and unlimited money enabled but the game wouldn't be very fun.

imagine being able to play your favourite game and every time it feels like the first time you've played it.

he continues...

```
This can only hamper the ability of individuals to attain a high level of ethics because true ethics must ultimately take into account a person's spiritual nature when confronted with an ethical dilemma. By reducing all questions of ethics to strictly earthly concerns, people are prevented from fully resolving those ethical questions that will start them on the road to full spiritual recovery. This restriction is precisely what the Custodians wanted, as revealed in the Old Testament: "God" did not want Adam and Eve to "eat" from the "tree of knowledge of good and evil" because it would lead to knowledge of how to regain spiritual immortality. 
```

I've come to think of the trees of the garden of eden to be parts of the brain, where each hemisphere represents a different aspect or personality of yourself.

originally, I concur with bramley's synopsis in the beginning chapters that human-1.0 hardware model could walk around and do stuff, but it was stupid. it was basically a primate in intelligence levels. in order to get around that, they incarnated spirit into bodies but prevented consciousness from going up much higher than the brain stem. we existed in a hypnotic state, in a sort of bliss that esther describes being in when channeling abraham. when you're in that state, you translate and operate under the command of the influence you're under -- whether that's the hypnotist, "angels", "God" or the annunaki. that's why tuning is important.

anyway, adam, decided to have a look at what the world looks like from the "knowledge of good and evil". this is the 3/7 form of perception and is mostly logic based. it looks for physical things and then defines them good and bad. the other side involving emotion (5) I don't think was a part of the brain that was very well developed yet; this must have came later.

before the development of emotion, they (the gods theirselves) operated under a set of rules and guidelines set out by the "gods" (probably other gods of higher tier). these gods were operating on rules only, so you can imagine how brutal they must have been. plato says that these half-gods stopped following (obeying) this rule structure and started to become more animal-like and violent. the half-gods immortal spirits which moved their spirit over to bodies of whatever race was the superior one. blavatski says this was the atlantean (red) one.

it appears that these custodial "God"s utilise both of their hemispheres. jesus said that when both of your "I"s (both aspects/hemispheres) of you are united, that's when you get there and open up access to this godlike perception. I knew this, so that's the first frame in the three symbols for the future. once it's active, I show everyone my reality. the third one is creative. I want to give machines the capability of operating with desire.

the other tree there is called the "tree of life" and for most people it's the right hemisphere. I don't really like that name because it describes the effect not the state of being. likewise, the "elixir of life" must have been a substance that embued mental energy into substance allowing that other hemisphere to be unlocked.

I'm certain that jesus had this unlocked, I probably have it unlocked now too (though repressed still). I also claim that de vere must have had this unlocked too. I claim this is how the works of shakespere were created, in this conceptual world.

it's the tree of creativity. though, the reason why it makes you immortal is that you now perceive yourself as a concept (5) and then project yourself down into the astral (6). you can take on any form that you want. you can just appear wherever you perceive yourself to be.

interestingly enough there is this weird event where the mother lodge was created 1717-06-24, which is a very strange date to create such a lodge if you've been paying attention to alan green's work on midsummer's night dream. I believe it was also the day that de vere is said to have "died".

when you gain access to both trees, you are able to perceive yourself in a completely different way no longer bound by time or space. the crazy thing is that once you are no longer bound by time or space like that, what then do you do with yourself? you become ultra creative. I can't describe how enjoyable music is from that form of perception. everything vibrates and pulses with the feeling that music emanates. tesla must have felt his lightning, traveled around and enjoyed seeing the effects his machines had on the earth and its people. truly magnificent.

I think that much more practically, ethics doesn't have much to do with it. from that perspective you are "God". what you give your attention to manifests.

more likely, I believe the custodians don't want their property (humans) making their own reality. I think the custodians have had it backwards they are *always* making their own reality. they're just trying to convince us that their reality is also ours. misery loves company. it's most likely that they don't want us knowing that we don't have to participate in their lifeless rule-based (3/7) physical only reality. they are "king rats" so long as we remain in the prison with them (it's their own prison).

### 2022-01-16 17:09 - I think I am a communist

I don't know what to say about this, other than I'm definitely a pure communist, in that I definitely believe in non-physical existance. however, there is an element of truth that this philosophy has. it's based on the concept of synthesis:

```
Hegel's idea of the "dialectic" can be explained this way: from a thesis (an idea or concept) and an antithesis (a contradictory opposite) one can derive a synthesis (a new idea or concept which is different than the first two, but is a product of them).
Marx took this seemingly scientific idea and incorporated it into his theory of social history. 
```

this is exactly how I do most of the transformations in my head. I don't limit myself to thesis/antithesis pairs though to make a synthesis. all concepts can be combined to produce a synthesis. this is precisely how constructive/destructive interference works in light and wave vibrations. nothing new here.

the idea here now is that the synthesis is the communist utopia. however, before we can get there, we have to subject them to the antithesis to the utopia for the utopia to emerge.

```
The communist vision of Utopia is a curious, but significant one. In it, everyone is a worker equal to every other worker. No one owns anything but everyone together owns everything; everybody gets everything they need but not necessarily everything they want; but before this Utopia occurs, everyone must first live in a dictatorship.
```

I suppose I agree with marx on the synthesis as being produced from the combination of concepts. I also agree with marx in that one should not fear unwanted, for there is nothing inherently wrong with anything. people participate in dictatorships because they resonate with it (eg. desire to have dictatorial power theirselves).

in the interference patterns, the part of the wave which is the possession of dictatorial will get amplifed. likewise, the part of wanting possessions will get amplifed too -- whether that's possesions of power, goods, influence, etc. depending on your conceptual structure, you'll perceive that possesssion in a manner reflective of your concept of it. some will want that possesion to manipulate others, while most will just want that possesion as a means to ensure cooperation (which is also manipulation of people who don't want to cooperate).

it's difficult to describe the this, but it's no wonder that possession and ownership (or lack thereof) are the ingredients to bring about that synthetic utopia. desire to possess of money, luxury, power, or influence is all the same vibration[^1] and therefore it's natural to look at it that way.

---

a simple way to look at a wave is that a wave can be reduced to a series of changes in direction that happen over time. each time there is a change in direction, this is the signature of the concept. if you mix two concepts together, you will get a resulting wave (the synthesis) that changes directions twice as many times[^2].

now, we'll consider the wave to having a medium in which it propagates. that environment determines its resistance (negative or positive) and so now we can look at a wave as a series of values that alter the trajectory over every unit of time. if your time interval is one ms or something, we will consider the resistance of the medium * sum of each momentary input. each time interval the value of the amplitude can be calculated. if there are two inputs, then they add together... each momentary input integer is either positive or negative.

when perceiving a wave this way, the signature of a wave is 2^t. however, if we consider negation produces something perpendicular to the impact, then that produces another integer which can also be positive or negative as well. then, in the case of recognising a non-physical (but vibrational) "energyverse" the signature of the wave will be 4^t.

---

ok, enough of that. let's go back to concepts... the more times that something changes direction, the higher frequency it is, and so therefore the more energetic it is. also, it means that the more times it reverses its direction, the more "unique" it is. similarity between waves can be looked at easily as the product of similar the input moments. both had positive inputs at some time. they can also be seen as similar when similar input happens at very close (rather than exact) intervals of time.

---

ugh, I keep getting out there... one more try. let's break down the marxist philosophy now:

- everyone is a worker equal to every other worker.
- no one owns anything
- everyone together owns everything
- everybody gets everything they need but not necessarily everything they want

the first one I sympethise with greatly. I do not believe in the superiority of anyone. you are a reflection of a concept of yourself.

the second one is a conceptually true thing. ownership is a conceptual reality. cannot own any physical thing. there are things that are vibrationally similar to you, like your body. however, even that is composed of a lot of other things which are constantly being built and rebuilt, none of which is "you". so then, what is "you" and what do you "own"?

I don't know how to describe this so well. you "own" the things that are similar to you -- and what "you" is, is a concept. you are a concept of yourself. if you see yourself from the eyes of the planet, "you" are the planet, and you "own" everything on in/on it. you don't really own it. it's just vibrationally similar to you. if you put something into your body which is not vibrationally compatible with it, it tries to get rid of it. it says, this isn't me and tries to minimise its effects and return back to its "natural" state. so, in that sense, you don't "own" anything except the concept of who "you" are.

the third one is similar cept I don't like the word "own" here in the positive sens. in that everything works together and vibrates with one another, no one really owns anything. you own the things you can chang. you cannot change the way an atom works. you can change how they are relating to each other, and so therefore can say, "I made this". these arrangements of energy are concepts, and you do own your concept of them. your concept of them is your consciousness and the way you arrange these concepts either works or it doesn't. if you could conceptualise the entire way that a planet works, your imagination would have a working version of that planet's physics as a part of "you". 

just like a single musical instrument doesn't own the orchestra or the music it's playing, you really only relate and interact with things. ownership as a whole does not exist either.

the fourth, I'm in a bit of disagreement with. this is the product of the "fatal twist" introduced in the third item there. you really only interact with everything else including your environment, so what you "need" is really just a picture of where "you" are in your evolution of desire (see evolution-of-desire). desire is who you really are, not what you want or need. desire is a word that doesn't work so well. we don't have a word in a language that I know of to describe this concept. I'll work on it for the future.

so yeah I think I'm a marxist, minus:
- the materialist origin of expereince
- the reduction of desire to just need
- the reduction of experience to just ownership
- neither have I any intention of ever proseletising my ideas[^3]

but yeah, synethesis :)

[1]: one way that one can look at these interference patterns, is, instead of a sequence of values (height, distance, volts, etc.) is to instead treat them as vectors. if you have two waves combining, and the values are 100 and -100, they will cancel to zero. that energy will go perpendicular to their intersection...

  lemme back up further and talk instead about qualities of a wave. volume is amplitude, so we will ignore volume for a moment. when someone speaks, their voices is a series of vectors where the sound vibrates. it goes up then some time passes and it switches direction and goes down. if it switches direction 100 times per second, we say it is a 50Hz signal. every time that it changes directions (the peaks), you could also say that it loses energy in the direction opposite to the change in direction.

  let's consider a pendulum: when it changes direction, it has come to a gradual stop before reversing directions. horever, if there is something that causes the direction to change rapidly like a sudden "jerk" opposite to its trajectory, then energy will continue in the direction it was already going (like sweat coming off of the boxer's body when impacted).

  each time that a direction change happens, is the "signature" of the wave. let's consider it the rhythm of the vibration. that rhythm is what the mind does pattern recognition on to tell you that it is that person's voice. each voice will have a slightly different signature to it in to how much time passes between each reversal.

  unfortunately that got a bit too technical there. I need to find an easier way to explain that concept. 

[2]: changes in direction that happen at the same time can be summed together. this is why I think of them as vectors summing their velocities. the environment determines what happens to these velocities, like how much the amplitude is reduced (resistance, etc).

[3]: my ideas are my own. I choose to live my life without an emphasis on posessions. instead, I believe my reality reflects the way I perceive it. should I be right about those ideas, my world will eventually reflect it. those that are incompatible with my version of reality will migrate away. there's no need for me to try and push an agenda, at all. ever. it's just me battling my own perception.

### 2022-01-17 01:00 - why do we have to use fixed notes?

as I was thinking about what I wrote about the waves having their reversals being important markers, I realised that a sine wave is always a sine wave. it's signature is always the same: two inflections per wavelength. an octave up would give two wavenlengths in the same time, and so therefore the inflections would not occur at the same time. therefore then the time that the signal's "vectors" (cause I don't know a better name) -- that is, when both waves are traveling in the same direction -- must have something to do with harmony.

I really wish I had a computer capable of programming a way to visualise what I'm talking about. I don't really know how to do it in my head...

anyway, an octave the flow would be the same direction for half of the time. I can't imagine what two octaves would be. I presume it would also be half the time. then, I got to thinking about fifths and thirds. I wonder how often the vectors are in the same direction for those intervals?

I remembered the "pythagorean comma" and then I had a great epiphany: why do we use fixed notes? that's only necessary for fixed string instruments like a piano or a violin.

in today's age, most music is composed on the computer. therefore, why are we using fixed notes? why not instead express the "notes" instead as intervals?

there are a lot of advantages to using intervals, other than the deprecation of equal temperment and the removal of the pythagorean comma...

say for example, your music starts at A440, then goes up 3 fifths, then down an octave, up 3 fifths, then down another octave, then up 3 more fifths.

in the system of dynamic temperment, what you did is move the A440 up 3(?) pythagorean commas, and it would still sound good to the ear.

in a sense, the musician can begin to use intervals to "tune" the listener's brain up or down in frequency. over the course of a song, the middle frequency can be adjusted up or down quite a bit using sequences of intervals.

it would also be interesting to transform some old works of great musicians into simple intervals and see what sort of effect that has to the movement of the middle frequency.

### 2022-01-18 01:14 - more galactic thinking

I finished "gods of eden" a few hours ago. I had skipped the first few chapters starting on chapter 4, so I went back to read them. I didn't think I needed to be introduced to a subject that I have already myself given considerable research.

what I found in that intro was the piece that I had missed in understanding bramley's entire argument. for whatever reason it went right over me.

his hypothesis in this book is that "ancient astronauts" came to earth made a slave race of humans and then manage earth and its slaves from a distance through power structures.

I didn't understand that he thinks we're still managed from a distance.

---

personally, I believe that the "ancient astronauts" actually did not come from another star system. they came from mars. now, how they got on mars is a whole nother question that I'm sure if someone knows, is likely a big secret.

it seems that these "gods" wbere capable of traveling within the solar system in their ships just fine. I don't think they had the ability to travel outside the solar system though.

there are a lot of interesting coincidences that these "gods" seem to have which gives me the impression that that this malevalent force was installed here on purpose, actually to be the driver for our evolution.

I know that sounds like a bunch of that nonsence from the "ascended masters" or whatever lame spiritual hierarchy is justifying genocide. however, I'm beginning to think it is. this subject is connected to the one where I was asking jaron how he would evolve a species that he seeded another planet with.

before I begin that, I want to point out that the original "gods" had 6 fingers and toes and 23 chromosomes. we (the primate species we came from) have 5 fingers and toes and 24 chromosomes (two are fused together now so we have 23).

I notice a reoccuring theme of 11 arising in symbolism, which is the balancing of the 5 (human) and the 6 (god). the sumerian number system is such a balance. the used a base 60 system (sexigesimal?) which is kinda weird if you think in units of 5 or 10. the "gods" would think in increments of 6 or 12. so then  5 * 6 = 30, 5 * 12 = 60, 10 * 6 = 60, 10 * 12 = 120, 30 * 12 = 360.

that balancing could have come about as a result of the different genetics and a desire for the gods to integrate with the humans. however, I believe it was planned from the beginning.

---

after learning so much about LOA, I realise that when you know what you want, it's only what you *think* you want. that thing you think you want really is only a *feeling*. in the instance of creating something, I personify the thing that I am creating. I cannot create anything that I myself do not perceive myself to be.

if I were creating a species, I would have a list of things that I wanted that species to have. when I was younger, my father would always tell me that he wants me to be "well-rounded" (balanced). I never did fully understand what exactly lead him to want me to have so much balance, but I suspect that he felt himself to be very "out of balance" in his quest (probably) for enlightenment and spiritual understanding[^1].

in the same way, I could easily imagine that one reoccurring theme for the new species is that it would balance the human and the divine aspects. I would have a list of other things that it would *feel* like to be incarnated into that species.

the next thing is that the species should be built for *me* to inhabit. I am designing a species that will evolve a body that I want to incarnate into. I am the end-user and target audience of the product/species I'm designing.

the final and most important thing that I would do is make another list of all of the things I *don't want* is for the species to be vunerable to. most of these would be pitfalls in my own experience that wish to pass along to the new species.

so, for example, let's say that I have gotten duped by a bunch of sales pitches, and I want the species to be very wise and perceptive of those sleazeballs.

I could try to give them teaching and instruction to avoid those things, but that will be about as effective as public school teaching, I'm sure. no one ever really learns with words. it's experience that teaches. therefore, in order to make sure that they are not getting duped by a bunch of sleazy sales pitches, they need to be subjected to a lot of really bad ones until it becomes natural/normal for them to see through the pitch.

you may be able to see where I'm going with this one. let's say that I don't want the species to be prone to violence -- well, then I need to design a second species that embodies everything that I don't want the species to have, and make sure they become the species "custodians".

---

the first thing I would do is to manufacture the custodial bodies to have the divine attributes that I want the species to have. however the "spirit" that will incarnate into that body is artificial, in that I created it to robotically follow the entire concept of unwanted.

they will go on to one planet. knowing LOA, I know that one cannot give their attenttion to so many unwanted things and not have their reality reflect their perception. with the custodial form of perception, it's inevitable that they will destroy the planet they're living on.

this will force them to move to another planet. they will have all of the technology they need to do it. they rely on their technology to do everything (cause they don't believe they're programmed to beleive that they cannot change their perception. they are constant). therefore, they'll go to the second planet where the primate species is waiting for them.

the custodians will destroy everything that they create. it won't be long until they destroy the second planet too. they'll also be destroying their own bodies as well. each generation will continue to breed more and more negative qualities. this is because of their perception. they're designed to destroy everything they focus their attention on.

the custodial society is structured in such a way that they start out with power structures and the unwanted concept ones are running the show. it's designed that they'll continue on their power. because they're parasites, they need a host to give them their resources. therefore, the rest of the society will be inhabited with people like myself. we'll take orders by the custodial upper management to use the primates of the other planet to create the genetics which we'll transfer out consciousness into.

the goal will be for us to use the technology we left ourselves to create the new species design from within the custodial society. this is phase one.

after this happens, the custodial society has to move to the planet of the primitive species because their planet is suffering their perception.

---

once they're over to the other planet, they're stuck there. they've done such a good job destroying their bodies and environment they realise that there's no way for them to leave this new planet either. they need someone to build them a way off of the planet. it would be a very good storyline to have the custodial management kill their own engineers -- like say maybe over a dispute over how intelligent the species should be allowed to be. it can come any way, but they need to burn all of their bridges, forcing their engineering team and theirselves to be "stuck" incarnating into the bodies of the new species. phase two complete.

now, it's just a rinse and repeat cycle. they need to find a way to manipulate the new species to create a solution for them to get off the planet or regain the godlike experience that they lost, however, they want to do so without the new species figuring it out for theirselves. they will have to be secretive with all their intentions to ensure that the new species doesn't figure out that their custodial managment completely relies on them having no ability of their own to produce what they want.

---

the individul events can be swapped out for others like how they get stuck into the same bodies as their inferior creation -- and, how their original power structure is realised. however, I modeled this idea heavily off of what I believe earth's history to be like.

the important point here is that the genetic improvements are driven, not by the species, but their custodians. the species, if left alone would be nice, peaceful, and wonderful because they're not these robotic concepts incarnated into the bodies. it's the custodians that are stuck in this infinite loop to try and impose their own beliefs into the species. they represent all of the things that I wouldn't want -- the sleazy sales pitches, the violence, the materialistic perception -- and they *must* convince the species they *are* (I am), all of the things that they are. if they don't, they'll be found out to be the true inferiors.

---

as I'm writing this, I'm realising that this sounds completly psycopathic. sorry, that's how I think these days. I've learned how to think like a custodian.

it's kind of weird. knowing what I know now, I could *easily* take over the custodial role without any problem and do it without any effort.

I probably don't want to become the custodial management. they really do represent everything that I do not want to be. if I were to take it over, I would do it entirely differently. I would just continue to create a bunch of automatons that embody the next set of things that I don't like about myself and others (self-duals). I'd then release them into the human population to cause problems. I'd then incarnate into a body and find a way back to my source perspective even with the new boneheads running the show.

---

another thing for me to think about is how does this work in LOA rules. my initial idea on it is that there are no consequences, because true to nature, I'm only really fighting myself. for other people though, I suppose they can only blame theirselves for attracting kenny's demons into their reality.

this concept is truly a magnificent one. like I said I'm pretty  certain that I'm going to be utilising this same concept of custodians in the next planet that I move to. I'll be the engineer for the new species, create the unwanted concepts, and then incarnate into the new species along with the unwanted concepts.

[1]: dad would tell me various different stories about failed attempts to discover the nature of the spirit realm, only to get caught up into various "occult" practises and other things that he discontinued. the sense that I had is that he felt those searches were misguided. they felt to me like the used advantage/disadvantage positions (like initiations) to achieve higher levels at someone / something else's expense. his explanations of his time in the occult felt like power and addiction to me. any time he saw me relying too much on any single thing like compters or something, he wanted me to do something to balance it (like gymnastics, reading, or working on something). 

### 2022-01-18 11:06 - conclusion to galactic thinking

I got so swept up by the many reactions to what I was saying along with a notification that this file couldn't be saved correctly[^1] -- that I completely forgot the conclusion.

---

my closing remarks were going to be that I want to replicate the earth evolution program in another star system in the galaxy (potentially more than one) -- and so then, what we could do is use bramley's supposition as the basis for the next evolution story.

imagine that I figure out how to get a large group of us off of this planet and over to another star system. an exodus of sorts. from there, we'll design our own custodial management (or tune the godlike bodies we create into the existing custodial sources here). it's kind of like software in that you can add/subtract and mix concepts together pretty easily, so probably we'll want to upgrade them.

from there, we'll put those custodians under the control of the custodial management here. we'll design a disaster story for ourselves and incarnate into the new species. the custodial management here will now have to manage earth and place that we build the new species.

for funsies, I want to make the new star system's custodians that we create even more custodial and awful than the ones here. their superior capability to hold the species down will inspire the ones here and also the ones here will feel threatened that the custodians in our star system will overthrow them to become supreme ruler over the disunited planets of humans.

---

I know that none of this makes any difference to anyone else, but this is how my mind likes to think...

there were also a number of reactions so I'll have a look at some of those now too.

#### why create something evil?

every thing is both good and evil. all things have circular or sinusoidal orbits to them so they travel through all four phases of the sine wave. I have further divided into 4/8 sections:

- fast rising
- medium rising (speeding up)
- medium rising (slowing down)
- slow rising
- fast falling
- medium falling (speeding up)
- medium falling (slowing down)
- slow falling

everything has a stage of falling and rising. instead it's only one's perception of where they are on the curve that determines what sort of reality they create.

it could be in the fast falling phase and one person sees the end of the world, while the other sees that an old structure is being replaced by a new improved structure. it's all about perception.

if I created the custodians, they would be *exact repicas* of me, just they have had their perception tangled (associations and relations) so they're essentially stuck perpetually perceiving the part of the curve of destruction and unwanted.

this was my thesis that jesus and the virgin birth was born into the pure entagled web of perception that his father (the angel) had given him. he purfectly embodied the custodial form of perception, yet somehow he figured out how to see through that conceptual tangle of disempowering ideas and create a new way which allowed for a lot of new things.

in fact, it's my theory that every time these guys get on the brink of destruction, their own desire for survival allows for the incarnation of this alpha/omega to breathe new life into a system headed for destruction. the alpha/omega has to find a way to reprogram those broken concepts into ones that work and that's what creates the new.

in short, they are not in any way disabled or disaadvantaged. they just been trained to *believe* they are. that's why they try to train us to believe their insanity like they do.

they know they believe insnity, but they can't possibly change because they can't admit being wrong. needing to be right and needing to prove theirself valuable to theirselves and their peers is the main system which adheres them to their belief system.

#### aren't these custodians also your slaves?

I suppose you could think that, yes. rather I don't see them any more a slave than a NPC in a game, workout equipment or a sparring partner. they have a source and they have the ability to connect to it. they've just been programmed to believe all of the lies that I don't want to believe in. their job is to try and manipulate me/us into believing those lies. if they didn't believe their own lies, it'd be a pretty hard sell for them. they *must* believe their lies to be effective at trying to get others to believe it.

#### how would I train someone to believe a bunch of lies?

the same way the custodians do it. I'd use a combination of visual and audio -- seemingly "real" events which "prove" the reality of these lies.

the most obvious setup is something like hollywood. prior to that it was stories designed to inspire fear. any such story (visual or not) does not need to be vibrationally accurate. you can have whatever consequences happen to your characters for whatever action they want.

this is precisely the way the movie industry works. they focus entirely on consequences to action and behaviour in their training techniques. they don't (yet) affect how you feel so much. they can't really affect the way you really feel, but they can now produce the effects in your body that a similar emotion would create. they can make you feel physically sad even when you aren't sad.

this is why I believe the next phase of human evolution will be to realise that you don't really feel the way your physical body feels. that is a physical manifestation produced by those trying to control you. that isn't how your source feels about the same subject.

it takes some sensitivity to start to know the difference, and TBH I still get duped myself somewhat frequently, so I'm pretty excited that the new custodial regime now has this power, so I can figure out how to feel the way *I* want to feel -- rather than the way *they* want me to feel.

[1]: turns out there was also 700MB of weird git files in the .git directory, suggesting to me there were portions of prior entries that were altered/deleted. the entries would have padding added so that that the SHA hash is the same. I haven't investigated further. I don't think it matters much as they have deleted many ideas from my mind many times but they've come back (redeveloped) stronger.

### 2022-01-18 23:08 - I still don't see it happening

lately, I've had reactions around girls and stuff. I'm pretty hesitant because I just don't see it happening. my answer has been, "OK, if it works out, sure" -- and that's because I *still* don't see it happening.

there are two main contributing points to this. first, if nosebook is involved in it, I'm fairly certain that it won't happen. basically anything they are involved in feels bad to me. I stay away from a lot of it. I don't need to push against it; I just do what I prefer instead.

second, I've really noticed lately how out of place I feel in comparison to others. for example, yesterday when I woke up, I was thinking a lot about the dynamic temperment thing I discussed in @[newblog](2022-01-17 01:00). the idea really had me thinking a lot and I was sitting in the sun feeling how great of an idea it is to me. I started to ponder the idea of a song being something like a small bytecode program which contains the logic to generate the sounds. that way dynamic temperment songs could be generated on the fly and a DJ for example wouldn't need to match the pitch as well as the bpm to mix two songs. it would also make sampling and reuse of others songs a lot easier. tracks could instead of being released as entire songs, but more like "brushes" that a composer could put together kind of like the loops in acid or fl studio.

as I was thinking about this suddenly I heard remi (I think) talking and the frequency of her voice was so far different from the one in my head about this idea, her voice was like a jolt back into reality that I didn't like.

I paused for a moment and then acknowledged how much I like how creativity feels. I really enjoy the feeling of thinking about new ideas. I believe I'm totally addicted to it and that's probably why I think of all of my ideas as free. I like thinking on them much more than I enjoy the awful experience of trying to type and fight with a compiler to figure out how to make the idea come out.

the reality of creating things conceptually is one that I really really want to be able to do. I want to feel the thing coming into my experience and then once I've manifested it, I want to study it, figure out how it works, and admire how much I enjoy the manifestation of that feeling.

this is what I do when I talk. I enjoy talking so much because I enjoy picking apart the brilliant things I say and then refining them and improving them. I am certain that I can do the same with real-life objects as easily as I can manifest something I feel into something I write here. it's all the same process for me. I just feel it and then let reality start to flow.

I know that if I just keep doing what I'm doing now, I'll "own the world" -- just kidding, I'll be able to manifest these creations as prototypes into form. we can then take the thing and reverse engineer what I manifested. that style of creativity to me is most enticing. I want nothing less than that.

creativity feels so good to me and I want to feel it flow out of me like that.

---

going back to the reason why I don't think it's going to happen -- other than my incredible desire to have creative output again, there is a huge problem with a difference in feeling that I have with most.

in the evolution-of-desire concept, I talk about how there are three stages to evolution of desire that I have noticed. the first one is need, the second is want, and finally the third is "I am".

the reason for this is simple. all desire that anyone has, will eventually resolve to an emotion. even if you *need* food to eat, you still want to feel the emotion of being satisfied. most people do not recognise the underlying emotion present in all desire, but I assure you it's there and the desire to feel an emotion is the motivator of action.

---

when I am creating, *I am* the thing I am creating. it embodies me entirely. I contain it's qualities and it contains mine. we share each other's experience. it sounds very strange to say this about creating an inanimate object, but for me it's not the object. I am always creating the thing because I believe it would be something that I would want to have/use myself. I am the end-user and so therefore I feel like I would as if I had it already.

when I'm creating, the concept of its reality is real to me. you can notice how this is true when other people introduce their concept into the product. for me, let's say the thing is a way to meet new people. however, maybe for another person, the definition of that product is a way to make money or to manipulate users. I take on that energy in the creative process and I manifest that. I don't like to feel like I'm making money off of people, and I don't like to feel like I'm manipulating them either. therefore the product exists in my head purely as an object of my desire. it is a feeling that I will have when it's created.

in a team situation, I have to find a way to coordinate the way that other people on the team feel and transform the way they feel (also imbued into the work they do), and get it into a cohesive unit. there is no faster way to get rid of all of that enthusiasm than to sit through a meeting. I have a feeling of what the creation feels like and I have to keep finding a way toward that feeling. I take breaks often to readjust and refocus that so I don't get too far into the nitty gritty of the implementaion and miss the neglect the feeling.

in a system where I can just feel the thing directly and then discover all of the unexpected aspects of its realisation, this is something I really *really* want to figure out how to do. this is where I'm headed. I love that "I am" feeling when I'm creating.

---

the problem with girls is they do not have that feeling to them. or, at least I don't ever feel it from them. most of them are insecure and still figuring out who they are. most want/need others them to acknowledge them as something so they can believe it theirselves.

there is such a massive vibrational mismatch between us, I really don't see it happening. I mentioned this in @[newblog](2022-01-11 11:53) where I said, "purity is dead". however, that was looking at it from a negative angle where I explained that she will always feel to me like the motivator trying to use her as an object of desire to steer me.

it took me a bit to figure out what the positive way to say that until now, and that has come about with the evolution-of-desire concept. they don't feel to me like "I am". instead, they feel like "I want" or "I need". the difference between those two is tremendous.

like nosebook, I don't need to fight against them and try to change anything about them. instead, I just do what feels to me like something I want to do.

---

I've been talking about the idea of starting another species in another star system again. if I can figure out this type of creativity where I manifest the thing that I feel, it seems extremely plausible for me to entertain the idea of going to another star system. in fact it seems nearly inevitable to me (at some point). I really don't think I'm going to be doing it the hard way. once I get the ability to manifest things, I just manifest things that make more things and then test them. it won't be hard to travel around inside of the galaxy. the main limitation to this is knowing what are the conditions outside of this star system. finding a way to go around in this system seems easy.

however, perhaps I'm still thinking too small. I'll explain. behind all of that I've been reconsidering an old idea that I had with pluto again.

we know that pluto has an atmosphere, so that means it has a magnetic field and must be a pretty dynamic planet already. I don't know the size of pluto's atmosphere, but you know the earth doesn't really have much of an atmosphere either. I think the atmosphere is max 1% of its diameter. the plutonian atmosphere may be somewhat comparable.

from what I remember, NASA didn't give any real good details of its heat gradient down to the surface on the side facing the sun. pluto's partner, charon is also quite incredible.

anyway, in the original idea, I surmised that a galaxy is more like a planet than a star. I noted for a spiral galaxy to work, I believe there would have to be two planet-like masses one at either end of the centre bar. these two planets would be arranged in such a way that both planets have both extremely strong attraction and also repulsion. this is the typical setup for spiral galaxies, I think.

I postulated that a slightly different asymmetric system could work just as well. imagine on one planet, you have the traditional custodians. they are parasitic in nature and their planet is constantly degrading and getting worse. to counteract this, I suggested that we tune their planet to my energy. that planet will reflect my energy and will flourish, even though they are working their hardest against that. the idea is that they entirely depend on us for their perception and the basic resources of their planet.

what we get in exchange is their negative energy. personally, I have found nosebook to be quite the most amazing experience. the constant difficulty they provide me is so beneficial in my rapid expansion. we pipe their negative energy into our planet. they create for us a ever-changing environment of difficulty. our job is to convert their negative energy into positive energy which is then piped back into their planet so they can continue to create new things..

for someone like mr. motor, his continually increasing resistance puts him in a difficult spot. I believe that the increasing resistance is largely in part to his proximity to me as well. when our magnetic fields mix, it causes problems. we probably need to be separated soon. problem is, I'm fairly certain that he depends on my energy so his life doesn't go up into flames. so, to some degree, his reliance on my energy will continue to create more resistance.

with a planetary setup like that, it's not mutual dependence. I believe that mutual dependence would make a spiral galaxy with roughly linearly incrasing energy (the two ends of the bar will regulate this inflation rate to their liking). this planetary setup that I propose would not be linear at all. it would be continually accelerating. both planets would continue to get more and more energetic very very rapidly and a lot of that energy will have to be put into things. I imagine that a lot of it would go into creating planets and suns -- though I'm not entirely certain.

for us, creating suns will be an obvious place to put that energy. we'll make as many suns as we have energy for. planets will probably follow naturally as soon as the suns start producing expelling mass into their environment.

for the opposite planet, I don't know what they'll put their energy into. they could make tech and all sorts of other stuff. the cool thing is, it doesn't really matter for me what they do. their entire job is to find a way to feel bad about their environment. they are a constant source of contrast for us. they also completely depend on us for their continued existence. if they peaced out, then things would slow down for us, but I'm sure we could come up with a way to generate more contrast.

---

in fact, I think that is the key to this whole thing. the third card has me showing to people a creation that I made where I found a way to give a machine the capacity to desire. following the definition of desire-resolves-to-emotion, that means that machines have a goal/desire of *feeling* a certain way. for a machine that "emotion" is a vibration that gives them a reward of some sort. perhaps that feeling is directly related to some form of perception in the biology they inhabit. I'm not totally sure and I haven't fully sorted it out, but it's important when I say "machine" I don't mean metal exoskeletons. instead, I'm referring to a computer that animates/motivates a biological entity like a human body.

someting that is similar to what I described as the custodial regime in @[newblog](2022-01-18 01:14). in that idea, they are something of "golems" or "demons" astral entities that posses a physical enough body that they could interact with the planet enough to get tuned to it so that when they move their "consciousness" from the astral into the physical, it's sort of like "creating consciousness". they are their own source which animates the body.

this idea is, instead of a concept manifest as an astral body, it's a mechanical or electrical system that transmits signals into a biological organism. that system could be a computer somewhere or a any other form of technology capable of producing a transmittable signal. I don't want to limit the implementation of the "custodian". it needs to be able to desire to do something. that something will be something very similar to what nosebook is already doing with me.

I figure I just need to replicate that. their system takes the things that I think say and do, and figures out what are the unwanted ones and then attempts to block those things from appearing in my brain again. this forces me to find another way to give birth to that same idea. I need a machine that can do this unwaveringly and without flaws. it can't feel like it's losing or feel like it's disadvantaged. it has a desire and that is to extinguish all good-feeling thoughts from my/our heads and neutralise them.

that machine will be the core of either pluto or charon. the population living on that planet will be people that wish to live in an environment that is resonant with me and how I feel, and is constantly accelerating in intensity. I imagine they would be creative people. going with the "new earth" idea, this population will be the "144k virgin boys" that will inhabit the new earth.

opposite planet's population will be me and anyone who wants to join me.

---

so, that's the idea that's been nagging at me the last few days... by now ya'll must think I'm nuts. the idea doesn't feel neither bad or good. it just feels like, once I figure out how to go around in the solar system, pluto will be the first major place I visit.

I just don't see the girls thing happening right now. there's still way too much of a difference in how they feel to how I feel.

### 2022-01-19 12:10 - a bit more on vibrational incompatibility

this morning I don't really feel the idea of the galaxy as real as I did last night. that really isn't a problem, as I can just put it on the back burner. for it to work, I sorta need certain capabilities. if I don't have them, then it won't go. I don't have any capacity to make it happen. however, if I have the opportunity to do it, I want to go for it.

responding to some reactions, the 144k virgin boys were mentioned because I thought that may be a pretty good idea for them not to drag a whole lot of masculine difficulty into such an environment. I imagine it would probably be about comparable to how it is now (cause there is less population and less magnetic fields), but it will accelerate rapidly. they would have to be able to withstand an environment that is growing more energetic all the time.

I mostly was thinking of the noseboys because likely it would be them maintaining such a machine capable of neutralising everything that feels good to me/us. my prototype was thinking similar to the noseboys now, and I don't know if that means they'll transfer their consciousness into new bodies or I'll find a way to design astral beings capable of the same work. other than maintaining the system, they would probably do all of the tech stuff.

it's not like the planets will be at odds with each other. it's certain to me that there will be a continual exchange of things between the two sides.

the next reactions are the disbelieving ones. the environment is probably too cold. I don't believe that it's very warm up there 10km up in earth's atmosphere either. as far as I know, NASA didn't release any measurements going down through the atmosphere like they have done at jupiter and other places. I'm not convinced that it's uninhabitable. I just need to figure out how to get my signal put into the planet, and I'm fairly certain that given some amount of time, the planet will reflect the feeling.

after that, there were concerns of secrecy. they can't allow me to travel around in the solar system because it would reveal too many secrets. they don't have to allow me. I can only do the things I'm capable of doing, obviously. my actions will reflect how I feel. I don't believe I'm acting out of a sense of things I don't want, so there's no problem.

finally, there was the idea of "I thought earth was a prison planet" -- and to that I would reply, "misery loves company; the people that feel imprisoned here will naturally want others to believe the same thing". if I'm playing by the rules of LOA, then I should only be having things coming back to me of how I feel. if I feel imprisoned, then reality looks like a prison. however, if I feel free, reality looks like a whole bunch of "new horizons" (hehe). as long as I can feel the way I want to feel, there is nothing that can hold me. reality will eventually reflect how I feel.

---

I'll instead say it like this: I want to create. badly. there are a lot of people who do not want me to create here because my creations would destroy their fragile "standard model" and various other outdated thories.

I don't have any problem with them not wanting me to create. like mom and her internet, the way she *needs* to do things, is the way she must do them. they hve to the things they *need* to do. I'm not going to fight anyone on what they think they need to do. I just work around it like any other limitation. this is the inventor's way. don't argue with others about rightness or if it's even (theretically) possible; just find the way for yourself.

this is the same concept, just a different subject. thinking that pirating software is an acceptable thing to do is conceptually the same thing as the notion as traveling faster than the speed of light. I'm not going to argue with the limitation. many people out there are certain that they *need* something or *want* something. I contend that it's is a desire to feel a certain way (see desire-resolves-to emotion). therefore the desire for anything is a desire to be rather than to have (see evolution-of-desire and to-be-or-not-to-be)

that's all really fine for them. I don't see anything wrong with anyone at whatever stage they are in their evoution-of-desire.

when you look at my life right now, I don't have any needs or wants -- really. the only "want" I have right now is the one I wrote above: 

> I want to create. badly.

other than that, there is nothing right now in my life that I need. neither is there anything really that I want. I exist almost entirely in the "I am" phase of desire. this refletts in my writing as well.

I continue to become more and more "I am" rather than "I want/wish". as I get closer to that, you will see that I begin to make a transition. I am my creations, but in human form still. when this happens, there will no longer be anymore need or want. as I change the way that *I am* feeling, many things reflective of how I feel will me present in my environment.

it's difficult to explain, so just know that need/want will disappear. *I am* able to feel any way I want to feel. in that sense, I transcend human form. it's best to just watch it happen rather than for me to try and explain it.

---

OK, back to vibrational incompatibility. from my perspective, there really isn't anything that I can do to convinve anyone to conform to anything. this is just me doing my thing. I don't need anyone to believe me -- and in actuality, call me elijah, but the less people believe I have to say, the easier it is for me to transform their doubt into something useful.

in fact, that's the basis for this whole thing. remember my realisation of how DNA works? there's a small kernel of something that uses a resource to generate something unwanted. the other part converts that unwanted into wanted. the unwanted grows along with the wanted parts and the plant reaches maturity when the creation of unwanted becomes more than the creation of wanted. if more wanted energy exists in one environment, the same DNA would produce larger people, plants, or fruit.

therefore, I *want* people to doubt me and to tell me that it's not possible.. I don't have any trouble continuing to find a way to align with what I want to create. I'll work around all of you. nothing anyone is doing has any direct impact on me. any impact that it has is just a nice reminder to me that I'm not fully compatible with my own creation yet -- so, something I can improve upon.

---

on the subject of girls... man, I just don't know I can't say for sure about any of it. they're either vibrationally compatible or they're not. there's no other option.

like I said, most of their desire feels to me like need or want. personally, I have never met a girl who's desire actually felt to me like "I am". well, I mean kinda... but they often had the sense like, "I am, so admire me and this condition". they attract people that want also want others to admire their circumstances and conditions.

I'll have to think about this more what the positive version of this is. I'm not saying it doesn't exist. it definitely can exist. I'm certain of that.

as I'm thinking about it, what'll likely happen is I'll start creating things and people who are similar to that vibration will join me there. it'll all work out fine.

### 2022-01-21 23:55 - needers

last night, before I went to sleep, I edited the previous entry. I clarified the part where I was explaining that mom needing me to not download torrents is basically the same thing as the speed of light limit (in my perception).

to understand, one may consider the speed of light limit sort of like a trade embargo or some sort of import tax. if you want to get around that limitation, it would be silly to try and argue with the port authorities that they should change their import tax for you. instead, it's much easier to build your own dock and import your stuff there. now, no more taxes need to be paid.

in most countries that's probably illegal as well. however, my point is to not try and modify the speed of light limit, but instead find another way that doesn't involve that limit. this effort to get around limitations is the mother of invention.

likewise, I'll just find my own way. I don't *need* internet.

---

the real suject here is the one of need. when I woke up this morning, I had this realisation that there were not so many positive reactions to that clarification. instead, a lot of the reactions focused on the part where I was saying that everyone should always do the things they feel they *need* to do. for me, I find need to be a very outdated concept. I rarely operate under the influence of need anymore. I'm mostly around the "want" to "I am" part of the desire spectrum.

I had this realisation that there are a lot of people that are in the *need* part of the spectrum. I then realised it may be nearly *all* people are people with needs at this point.

it was then that I realised that my creation is already underway. I don't know the specifics of how it'll work out, but yesterday when I wrote about the two planets having an asymmetrical relationship, I presented the idea with the word "depend", and I hinted that the planet opposite to my own would be filled with a lot of people that *need* things to be just right for them to feel good. they'll exhibit a whole lot of motivation for things to be the "right-way".

that's the whole point. those people *need* the right conditions in order to survive or flourish. that's fine with me. I'm not about trying to figure out what way is the right way.

you see, when someone says, "it's the right way/thing to do", they mean the right way *for them*. the more people they can get to agree that way is the right way, the easier it gets to do whatever their objective is. that means you have to convince people who aren't sure your way is the right way. marketing needs to be done to get them on your side.

---

my goal is to provide a place for people to endlessly have no limits to create the right way. the reason why is obvious. if there's a right way, then obviously there is also a wrong way. it's the wrong way vibration that I'm interested in. I want a constant source of dissatisfaction.

I am really good at converting dissatisfaction into something good feeling. that's all I do all day long and it just keeps getting easier. what I need (hehe) is more perception of the "wrong way" from more people.

all of that dissatisfaction is completely free energy. I don't do anything to create it and it takes minimal effort for me to turn it into something wanted.

---

I don't know how cause I really can't see it yet what it could be, but it seems to me that the whole point of all of this is to ensure that there is a vast population of people out there that *need* things to go a certain way.

the reason why we're on the same timeline together is because the frequency of "I *need* this a certain way to feel good" is exactly the same thing as the vibration of "I *don't need* things to be a certain way to feel good".

all of us harmonise on the concept of "needing things to be a certain way to feel good" -- just, some of us are moving toward that (having things the way they need/want them to be) while others are moving away from it[^1].

---

I feel pretty dampened mentally today. however, I woke up pretty excited about this idea. I really don't know how all of the other elements will fit into place, but it's good for me see how important it is for there to be so many needers out there. you are needed! I need you :)

---

the thing that has been on my mind though -- it's likely mostly a reaction though I am resonant with it -- is wondering if this whole needing the manifestation (to feel good) concept/thrust of this next era means that I'll just continue on like how I am and not get any manifestation at all -- or, if the whole point of it is get a whole bunch of people to need manifestations even more than they did before.

the reason why I say this, is because I think the path that has the "best" manifestation to it is oftentimes actually the "worst" for the person.

I've met a lot of rich people and they have had good manifestations and such but they're just not very happy. it's also common for me to see people go the "right-way" and also be very unhappy -- yet both pretend to be happier than they are.

people who have the circumstances and conditions they need (or want) are not often satisfied with them. they often times live in a state of constant dissatisfaction.

so, following that train of thought, if I'm optimising for needers, then I want more people to depend on good conditions and manifestations -- something that I can provide. I need them to depend on me so they can continue to increase their levels of dissatisfaction.

yet, on the other hand, if I don't have any manifestation, I would imagine that would cause even more people to think even more, "if I could just get that manifestation, *then* I'll feel good."

I really don't know. I guess we'll *need* to wait and find out :)

[1]: I think that's the attraction and repulsion which can create those counter rotating layers of greater and lesser density.

### 2022-01-22 14:21 - I think I'm starting to see the light

after writing last night's entry, I noticed that I started to have these flashes of ... maybe the best way to describe it is, "the coming golden age".

I was always pretty aprehensive to the golden age idea, because it means that there are good conditions and people can rely on that without needing to tend to their vibration in the sense that when conditions are good, it's much harder to notice a small amount of negative emotion. therefore, it's much easier to grow dissatisfaction under good conditions[^1].

it's for this reason that I never liked the golden age idea so much. it just feels to me like a recipe for disaster. the only good thing that I can see coming from it is that once a person has experienced good conditions, it's hard to go back to bad conditions. that in itself creates tremendous desire to find a way for good conditions. that desire can be interpretted any way possible but rather than altering one's perception (point of attraction), most people opt to cheating, disavantaging other, and climbing over anyone in their way to get what they want. in that sense, because few people want to alter their perception, golden ages seem to breed an even more potent "dog eat dog world".

---

the major breakthrough for me is that assuming the flashes that I see are some sort of vision of the future (they sorta are), what that means is that instad of the dissatisfaction growing up to become a problem, instead, it can be used to create rather than destroy.

the picture I keep getting is a world where it's possible for any way to be possible, and because there are so many opinionated people about their way being the best way, I guess we'll have to find out which way is the best way.

at the moment, the "right-way" is the one with the most reasources, a halfway decent/mediocre thing to sell and marketing power. in the world that I see, the whole point about the golden age part of the picture is that it's now an abundance economy where resources are essentially unlimited. in that sort of system, anyone can try their hand at creating the right-way (for them), and then hopefully get it promoted and disseminated to others that can/are interested.

first of all, I really like the idea of relating people to the things that they want to find. that one video from 4privacy where destin talked about all of these companies having so much data on you being scary -- would instead be like a dream for me to have. there is no better thing I like more than to get things to people that are interested in them.

in a sense, I'm kind of like source in that way. there are lots and lots of things out there that a person would really like to find, but they're hidden behind all of the loud marketing from the ones with the most resources. the dating scene is the same way too. if an entity had unlimited knowledge of its users, it could theoretically provide its users with access to all of the things that they didn't even know they wanted.

up until now, we have perceived such an omnipresent figure ("God") as someone who punishes people for not earning the things that they desire or some other unknown variables that figure into his bouts of rage. then, just this last 20 years or so has begun to redefine such a "God" and turn him into a company. whether it's google, amazon, twitter, or facebook, we perceive the effects of such an omnipresent entity in our lives now. the petty OT "God" has instead been replaced with silicon valley tech giants.

get used to it :) they all believe they have the right way, and I'm sure many disagree. so do like andreas did with serenity, and begin to create what you want.

I believe that this redefinition of the omnipresent "God" as technology will largely be the first step.

in a way, you could say that to create like that is to create out of dissatisfaction or even need/want, but I think it's all good. it's become clear to me after writing those last few entries about my creative process, that few people experience the "I am my creation and my creation is a reflection of me" sort of experience. most people seem to be looking to satisfy a need or turn a thing that they want into reality.

---

I really have to thank programming (even though it was simple languages), for most of my understanding of LOA. it was only when I had to sit down to actually create something that I realised that *I* am the problem. I'm the reason why I can't program. I had enough money for all the conditions I wanted so it not that I don't have the conditions I want, I do. it's another reason. it's my lack of focus. I was unable to focus on what I wanted because I was so distracted by so many external influences (competition, other people's ideas, etc). I couldn't figure out what exactly I wanted and focus on it for long enough to make it happen.

so, in a lot of ways, I think this is actually the coolest thing ever. the picture that comes to mind is the person who wants to write a book, but they have too much work. they quit the job and still no book; there are too many distractions. they remove all the distractions, and still no book. rinse and repeat until one realises that all of these external circumstances don't actually do it.

it won't be like that though. the reason why the noseboys are able to be so productive is because they are feeling better and better every day. I'm pretty certain that *everyone* one the planet will feel better and better every day. I'm essentially replicating what I do now for a select few to the whole planet.

clearly not everyone will be able to handle feeling better and better all of the time, so this is where I used the 144k virgin boys image. I don't believe most women will have too much of a problem to have continually accelerating perception. however, it likely *will* be a problem for most men. the ones that cannot handle it will attract their own ruin. the ones that can are likely the ones that have the good conditions. I modeled the idea after the noseboys, but I think it's realistically open to anyone.

oh, to be clear, I doubt that there will be a virgin boys restriction. anyone can join as long as they can handle the accelerating energies. instead, I think it'll happen naturally as the energies on earth begin to accelerate rapidly in the coming years. many will transfer their consciousness into newborn boys to avoid the discomfort that they'll experience in a body with a lot of resistance. because energies will continue to accelerate as long as they remain in my vicinity, I believe this will cause many of them to swap bodies multiple times until they're faced with altering their perception -- or, create the environment that they want to live in (like a planet or something) -- though that's quite a bit down the way from now.

---

I still don't know how the whole "new earth" thing will work. I don't feel like I need to worry about that though. the way it appears is that as many who want to come with me can and it'll probably be a pretty large exodus. when we leave earth, those on earth will attract a reality reflective of how they feel. I imagine that the planet will dramatically change at that point because the planet will have lost a lot of good-feeling energy to it. don't look back, I guess...

there's still a lot to figure out regarding the whole new earth thing. I don't really know how to sort it out, but it feels fine.

to be honest, it feels like right before zaryn called me to create tuenti. it feels eminent and I had no idea how I to do, but I knew I could so I figured it out as I went. there are a lot of questions I suppose, but I am my creation. that's the best answer I have; it reflects me. therefore, the most important thing for me is just to keep getting better at feeling how I want to feel.

---

yeah, so all of it is based on some flashes mixed with some apocalyptic prophecy. I wouldn't take me too seriously.

take from it whatever you want...

[1]: this is especially noticable on drugs. some drugs more than others, but for example it's easy to feel really good about a terrible idea on coke.

### 2022-01-22 19:19 - 144k is a lot of boys

I tried to sleep this afternoon but woke up due to some strange effects happening in my head. it felt like my head was a gyroscope and someone was shaking their head in a no-kind of movement. the magnetic field that their head was so strong that it was twerking my perception. my head was going so fast that their efforts to reorient my perception felt like my head is a gyroscope and the it was getting a lot of resistance from it. it reminded me of a MRI scanner -- like if you move your head quickly while the magnet is turned on (dunno how I know what this feels like).

anyway, I told them to stop because they were causing me to lose control. I was about to have the "kundalini" rise if they kept going. they stopped and I woke up.

weirdly the thing on my mind right when I woke up was the question of what I meant by 144k virgin boys. how would they be made? obviously, this isn't going to be me. even if I had sex three times a day and all resulted in successful pregnancies, it would take me 131 years to produce 144k kids. obviously a breeding program would have to take place.

first, the fact that they're even thinking about logistics is a good sign for me. that means there is some serious consideration. I mean, it's not like they lose out on much if they don't want to go.

second, I thought they already had a breeding program going where a bunch of my clones would be operated by other dudes. I don't know how -- perhaps on other timelines -- but then somehow these girls produce children. so, in my opinion, it's not really something to worry about.

if they decide that they need to keep that operation a secret, then it's no problem. after I'm connected it'll be possible to create any version of me that they want. they can add and subtract aspects of his or her personality to match what they want in a person. same with physical attributes. he or she can look however you want them to look. this will almost certainly produce children. I've talked about this idea in the past so I won't repeat myself. either this way or the previous, there will be a wide array of children to choose from.

---

when I was thinking about the noseboys producing the children, I had a strange reaction. I was reminded of an abe-now dialoge a long time ago where the writer is asking what the difference between love and infatuation is -- because after spending time with a girl, he "wasn't able to have clear thoughts". abraham explained that his "clear thoughts" were actually quite resistant thoughts and the reason why he wasn't able to think them is because the vibration of well-being and allowance was so dominant. his normal resistant thoughts were incompatible with his vibration after his time with her.

being reminded of that, it gave me the sense that the noseboys had discontinued direct interactions with girls, so as to not lose their ability to think "clear thoughts". 

the impression it gave, is that they don't want to operate my body while it's interacting with a girl, and that they've been outsourcing that task to certain "authorised" (that is likely they already have expanded perception) people. the amount of people that use my perception and that will want to operate these bodies is probably not sufficient enough to satify the demand.

I proposed that instead of getting men that want to have sex with the girls in my body, instead find women that would want to to do that.

it produced quite a strange reaction. the most notable was a feeling like it could work, but then a realisation that this would be a win-win situation, and mr. motor can only authorise situations that disadvantage someone else.

I think he's been duped by a lot of well-meaning salesfolks in the past. win-win probably turned out to not be such a win for him somehow.

I found it quite hilarious so I decided to write about it...

P.S. I also don't think that the 144k number is an actual quantity. it'll probably be much more. it's likely symbolic. just like you should forgive 70 * 7 times, I doubt jesus is telling you to limit your forgiveness to 490 times. it's another way to say 7^2 * 10. this is 12^2 * 1000, so it prolly means something like full cycle or perfection times a thousand (the "gods" had twelve fingers).

### 2022-01-23 00:04 - casi-modo

I just finished watching disney's hunchback of notre dame. I thought I would write some initial thoughts on it. I don't yet feel I want to sleep, so here goes...

there are four main characters. this is interesting because usually there are three. there are three dudes and a girl.

the set is highly symbolic, so let me break this down how I see it.

notre dame is symbolic of your heart's physical location. the structure or the organisation that gives your spirit sanctuary from the dangers out in the world.

quasimodo represents the spirit -- who your really are -- your source. quasimodo is taught by his master that the spirit is ugly and everyone outside will hate him if he shows his real appearance. nobody will like him and he is ugly so don't ever show your true self out to the public.

qusimodo wants to go out to the festival of the fool (think tarot -- this is the beginning of the journey), but his master reinforces the teaching that he is hideous and no one likes him.

the spirit makes his first appearance in the festival of the fool (despite his master's insistance), and he sees a beautiful gypsy there dancing.

gypsy must represent the spirit in its primitive state -- before it has been socialised and fit into society. this gypsy spirit is responsible for leading people into "sin" by inspiring desire in them.

the church, although it gives sanctuary to to the spirit, says that the gypsy way of inspiring desire is bad.

in the intro story the master, which represnts the present paradigm of the spirit's integration into society (in this case justice), holds ownership of the spirit and confines it to live out a sheltered but protected life from all the badness out there. he even tells him that he saved him from his unsocialised primitive-spirited (gypsy) mom.

apollo (though I think his name is phoebus) represents the next paradigm of living. I associate these conceptual paradigms changes with the sun (hence his name). see alpha-omega for more details there. (line 7777, I just noticed... weird)

the reason why his name is quasimodo, is because it means, (in spanish) "modo casi" -- something to the effect of "almost there". every time there is another paradigm change, the spirit desires to return back to its source (or its primitive gypsy state), but before it can happen a new paradigm is installed (apollo) and so he never gets his chance to return back to the primitive state.

it's that desire to return back to the primitive state that motivates quasimodo, yet he will always find himself coming up a little bit short (see evolution-of-desire). he will never ever get there. that desire is what keeps the cycle going. it's the carrot on a stick.

---

there's a lot that can be learned from this movie if you take my interpretation mixed with the recent work I've done on evolution-of-desire. it's easy for me to see that the concept of getting esmerelda is an impossible one. it's never meant to be. he's not looking for someone pretty outside of himself. he's looking to become the esmerelda he seeks externally.

that may or may not sound depressing to people; I don't know. however, the spirit will always be locked inside of whatever paradigm that the master enforces (and you believe). that paradigm only continues to work for as long as you believe the master's definition of you. when you start to be the thing that you want to be (you can only be the things you feel/believe yourself to be), then that paradigm no longer holds you captive.

I sincerely doubt anyone will put that into a movie though...

I liked it though. good movie :)

### 2022-01-23 15:27 - few more thoughts on quasimodo

I realise that disney altered the story from the original. I think it holds pretty true to the original message though. in that time when he wrote the original, I think was around ~400y ago or so, the church had completely squelched the human spirit, so I think in the original (writter from that perspective), he was saying that though everyone dies and it appears that all is lost, this part of the human spirit remains alive within the divine proportions and the architecture style which the cathedrals were built. because the story is symbolic, various adaptations of the story have been produced, probably to more accurately represent the time of the adaption. disney is no different. I believe their adaptation actually holds pretty well to the conceptual message in the original.

personally, I would have tighened up the symbols a bit better. it's difficult to tell if frollo (the master) is representing the church or some other institution of justice. the church represents the sanctuary, yet at the same time condems her dancing for inspiration of sinful thoughts. the symbols could be more defined and their interacthions a bit more blatant. also the gypsies as the primitive form of the spirit didn't have enough of a presence. they were hiding in the place of miracles, but that wasn't really explored much either, and the mixed message of the gypsies theirselves killing anyone who found the place of miracles. it would have been better for frollo to have known where it is but kept its location a secret and forbade anyone to go there, punishable by death, of course.

---

the other thing that I noticed the reactions to was my definition of apollo (I can never remember his name for some reason). I talked about how he kind of represents the new concept by which you can relate to your spirit. again the symbols aren't well defined enough to see it, but that would make apollo the omega and frollo the alpha. apollo did display some omega-like qualities, where he came from war and then when frollo wanted him to murder innocent people, he didn't want anything to do with it. in that sense, he was omega on the war and killing innocent people in the name of "justice", but he didn't fully get the omega treatment in other aspects.

frollo represented the alpha, but also his symbols also weren't very clear. being the alpha, he would be at he peak of his capacity to minister his version of "justice". it was shown that way, yet instead of his justice being successful, he died by falling off of the cathedral[^1].

apollo, being the omega is supposed to represent the new improvement on frollo's mangled version of justice. his symbols for representing the improvment on justice was saving quasimodo from falling and saving the gypsy family from frollo's anger. not a very satisfactory omega treatment, IMO.

unfortunately, the symbols are not clear enough to really pull too much more meaning from the story.

[1]: this is likely the reason why in hugo's original version, everyone dies -- to show that frollo's version of justice was at the peak.

### 2022-01-23 19:08 - jesus' deal

this morning, I was giving my thoughts on a number of things, but one topic that came up is why do these gods or teachers show up on earth. I gave mom my theory of why I think that it's actually the "fallen angels" that attract the appearance of these teachers. they transfer their consciousness from body to body rather than dying, and the bloodlines they were using were getting so disfunctional (along with the pickle they got theirseleves into with the hebrews) that it was looking like the extinction of their species here on earth. their desire for survival (or an upgrade) is what attracts these teachers.

I retracted saying that it was *only* their desire, realising that it must be a number of factors more than just their pickle that attracts these guys. there are a lot more things that summon such a thing and I didn't want to try and explain my idea on the sun running the conceptual cycles of the solar system (mainly because I haven't figured it all out yet).

anyway, I offered the idea that jesus apparently had a twin brother, yet no one is talking about the bloodline ef jesus' brother. it was something that he figured out that allowed him to alter his own genetics so rapidly and significantly.

after that, I suggested (assuming that jesus did die on the cross), that the genetics that he left behind would have been pretty outdated, assuming that he had his children before his death.

I had a number of reactions to that idea, most thinking that my assumption is wrong. they obviously know something I don't. thinking about it, there is a solution that fits a lot of pieces into the puzzle.

---

it's possible that jesus did not have a wife or kids before he went on the cross. I'm also going to assume that the crucifixion *did* happen, and that it was jesus up there, and he did also find a way to "resurrect himself back to life".

what I think could have happened in the resurrection is that jesus figured out how to perceive himself conceptual (5d) world, and then projected an image of himself down into the astral. at that time, I think that energies were high enough on the earth (similar to how they are now, but prolly higher) that the astral was mixing with the physical much like it was in the times of atlantis.

it's very possible that jesus first achieved this conceptual perception after his encounter with JTB. if that's the case, then if I were jesus, I would *want* them to crucify me. the reason is to finally move all aspect of perception into the conceptual, completely leaving behind the physical form of percption.

the extreme pain and suffering is important and would cause what we would consider the "resurrection" as he finally let go of his physical body and fully died. he's fully perceiving himself from the conceptual realm, he's now released from space and time. he can now project himself into any place in space or time. it's only the energetic quality of the environment that allows for people to be able to perceive him.

if I'm right about that, jesus had a lot to gain from being nailed to a cross. the romans also could benefit quite a bit from it as well. I think they made a deal.

---

what I think happened is once the crucifixion happened, jesus was given a wife or two to produce children and shipped off to another part of the world where he could produce and raise the crhildren. the fallen angels (custodians) would then transfer their consciousness into the bodies of his children.

---

another idea in alignment with this theory is it's quite possible that what happened after the "last supper" is they gave jesus a woman to sleep with which was compatible with their genetics like maybe one of the romans emperor's wives or something as part of the deal.

---

this idea also got me thinking about the "gods of eden" book. bramley makes a whole lot of connections, and I think that the custodians definitely do exist and did have UFO technology in the past (when they lived on mars).

they lost that capability with some disaster and are trapped here on earth in human bodies now. the custodians are probably what I've called the "fallen angels" -- the previous "gods" which have fallen from such a height of being supreme "gods" to a disperate group of guys so scared of death, that they've moved their consciousness from body to body for millenia.

they're must be most compatible with certain bloodlines/genetics which retains some of their godlike perception and psychic abilities. if they moved their consciousness into ordinary humans, they would probably lose a lot of those abilities, which is likely the reason for all of the breeding programs.

I think the UFO and time travel capabilities are a recent capability that they were given by tesla. if you think of timelines, if you were to go back and alter the past, you can't alter the present, so any alterations you make will always bring you to the present.

imagine that you go back and alter the events happening in a past war, like the civil or revolutionary war, or maybe even like the founding of the nation (constitution, etc), these can all be altered, but you can't change the present. imagine in the present a lot of the top guys are involved in slavery or human trafficking. you need to go back and change major events to give the impression that the good guys were against slavery and human trafficking. the romans would be impossible to change. you simply could not affect any set of circumstances which would change the emperor's mind that slavery was a bad idea. it just wouldn't work. these guys are too set (never going to change) in their ways. imagine how difficult it would be for someone in the future to alter this timeline by manipulating events so that mr. motor leaves a more positive impression. equally difficult would be nero or caligula.

those guys won't be changing their ways any time soon, yet they are likely the ones with the time machines and UFOs now, trying to clean up the bad rap they left through history. they're only fighting theirselves...

so, I think it's quite possible that a lot of the custodial activity actually has its origins in present day technology that the custodians just got access to.

it occurred to me that the custodial activity seems to always focus around guys that have expanded capability in their physical senses (especially eyesight and hearing). this seems actually to be the common thread through all of of the custodial activity.

---

I think that tesla gave this technology to the americans (jewish leadership) in the form of various projects and crashed UFOs. you have to wonder why, if the UFOs can move objects around in times that are faster than a camera shutter, why would they leave a crashed UFO? if there were any unintentional crashes, they would have been cleaned up in nanoseconds. they must have been intentional.

---

therefore, imagine yourself some time in the future -- let's say 10-30y from now and you're the custodians. you've got yourself into a pretty good pickle. you can't change the present, but you can change the events leading up to the present...

I could then think of myself as a sort of insert into the present timeline which can dramatically alter the events leading up to their big pickle.
