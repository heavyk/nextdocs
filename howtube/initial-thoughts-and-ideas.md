# howtube - thoughts and ideas

### introduction

I want to write this out before I begin to look at the present implementation. the reason for this is often times one's initial impression often has many insights that are then later buried under the details of implementation. I consider this more the "ideal" of the concept rather than the implementation of the concept.

### background and motivation

I'm coming at this from an entirely different angle than I did previously. previously, I wanted to create an idea where many different concepts could be presented in a visual and captivating way -- a sort of like interactive wikipedia -- allowing the user to begin to get a bigger and bigger picture until they feel like they grasp the concept.

this idea however is way too far ahead of its time. no one cares about trying to get the bigger picture and there are a lot of forces that *do not* want people to actually see the bigger picture -- so it's sorta like trying to fight the behemoth. it's not worth the effort.

instead, I have noticed that people are very interested in their *performance* in various subjects. this means there is a strong desire to optimise one's technique. in general, I have noticed that one's performance is directly linked to how good one can feel about theirself.

so, in general, the more proficient one becomes at performing certain techniques, the better one can allow themselves to feel. this is directly illustrated in those "life-hacks" videos that were quite the fad for a while. so, from a marketing perspective, the message is, "the better you are at these things, the better you can feel about yourself"

all marketing is linking the product to an emotion (or a mental picture which produces an emotion) -- so, the goal of howtube, I think, would be to try and get people to feel more and more proficient at producing the conditions that they feel they need to have (to feel the way they want to feel -- good about theirselves).

for a lot of people, when they feel good about their ability to *do* something, it ignites a sort of passion in them to do more of it. for example, notice how if you tell a kid that what they're doing is pleasing ("you're doing a good job" "your efforts are very important to some larger goal") -- then, it inspires them to do more of it so they can get that recognition and approval of their efforts. I think the root of this is perception is in one's own belief that they are worthless or good for nothing -- so, to feel like one is capable and accomplished really feels good.

### the interactive howto

one of the things that howtube could leverage in an interactive format like the web is interactive "instructions". the age of static instructions are gone. instead, here, I see a system where graphics (wireframes and schematics) can be dragged around, rotated, moving parts and intactive labels that allow the user to see in more than just 2d the different angles of whatever is being built.

a few months ago we put together a shed and it came with instructions video on how to build it. we were out there with the phone watching the video on how its done. there was a lot of pausing and rewinding. however, if this same video were instead split into two/three parts -- the narration of what needs to be done, along with a 2d/3d schematic of what is being accomplished in that section. then, the final part which was mostly what the video was -- which was a demonstration of it being constructed.

this idea can be expanded and a generic way for all companies large and small to put their instructions up on the site and instead of having to do a custom video and instructions for everything, it will allow companies a format for creating instructions easily.

there's a lot of marketing potential that can be leveraged here as well, because it benefits the manufacturer to have their product's instructions in an easy to access place, while at the same time, each partnership is more free users for howtube.

##### the principal of sharing

I'm putting this idea in its own section because my intuition says it may very important.

for these interactive howtos (IHTs), one thing I think should be pretty important is the ability for others to access and improve upon others' instruction diagrams. not everyone has a super team of graphics designers that can put together a really great presentation. or, for example in the case of geometry, there is no sense that I have to recode all of the things to create the platonic solids -- these sorts of things should become generic things so that people can share and contribute to the library of visual demonstrations of concepts.

there are two major formats available for this -- webgl and svg which are both quite interactive. both of these should be integrated into the presentations allowing for visual demonstrations. I thing at first this should be opt-in, but with visual artists getting their work out there and other people utilising these graphics, I think it will quickly turn into a marketplace of its own. I even propose that just as youtube has a sort of kickback for the content creators, it would be nice if the companies/organisations could reward in some way these improved graphics and techniques to present the most optimum technique.

as this grows, this could become quite lucrative and howtube could become the go-to place for getting presentation graphics.

it also gets a lot of graphics designers moving and producing more and more things. there are other things that most people take for granted like sound effects and voiceover talent. on the subject of sound, I predict a audio syntax or language will begin to form as people begin to converge on the best sound cues for different things (like maybe a ding sound for each important point in the presentation -- or a tick sound for each required ingredient).

##### cornering the life-hacks and cooking markets

it's pretty clear from people's utilisation of pintrest that there is considerable market for cooking and life-hacks sort of things. these markets should be pretty easy.

### my goals and involvement

I don't really want to be involved that much. I offer all of my ideas and insight for free. I prefer to work on silly little (inconsequential) things, as they continue to lead me toward greater and greater heights of understanding the big picture.

I absolutely love to write out things like this because they force me to begin to put some of these things into manifested thought instead of just a "sense" or an "intuition".

I'd love to continue to write these sorts of things out. I'll likely make another one in a few days after registering and having a look on the site.

this format is sort of an experiment for me. previously, on other teams, I was responsible for too much of the implementation aspects, and I enjoy a lot those sorts of things, as you can tell, I have strong opinions about things about how things should be done. this conflicts with people and I don't want to do that.

I also get too invested in the project myself, and I've found that to continue to see the bigger picture, I prefer to maintain some distance.

this distance does not mean that I'm not invested in the project -- instead, just the opposite. the more twists and turns in the companies drama, the more ideas and solutions I have to come up with. I often see a way of approaching things which does not fit the paradigm (for example the graphics sharing) and I don't want to fight to get my way. implement the ideas the way that best fits the investor's objectives for the company. I don't want the responsibility.

additionally, I don't want to deal with the financial aspect. I have a strong drive to become profitable, and most investors want the company to accrue more and more debt and depend on the investors further. that's a fine thing, but it's not for me. I like my independence. I enjoy doing what I want when I want to do it. I have good insight, because I do things because I want to -- not because I have to.

you have to understand that from a LOA standpoint, the whole objective of the company is all about telling people how to do things. this is very much not at all what I'm about. I'll give my ideas, and I'm sure there are many people that have strong opinions on *how* they should be implemented. those are the people that you'll be attracting gobs and gobs of with this sort of project.

### one-upmanship and competition

when it comes to implementation and technique, everyone has an opinion on the best way to do things -- and it's usually the way that the person does it. it's a very opinionated thing. to create a growing environment, it's important to not have a giant pissing contest between the different creators. therefore, to prevent a lot of this, it should be encouraged that people identify one idea as being an *improvement* on another idea.

I believe this should be done partially by the content creator (sorta like how youtube video responses were intended to be), but then also I think it's a good idea to let users identify similarity and improvements between implementations.

the different techniques presented should also not be one time things that can never be changed (like youtube videos) and instead new versions of the technique could be presented integratinging the ideas of others.

I think it could be cool that in a sense each presented topic is sort of like a portal and people could subscribe to that technique and receive updates on that technique as further improvements are made. as an example, even something as simple as laying down concrete could get improvements as new concrete addatives are discovered to improve various properties.

each technique could have browsable previous versions and is generally a community resource for people to collaworate on the subject.

### ratings

because implementation techniques is such an opinionated thing, ratings need to follow the format of people's opinions -- therefore, it's not enough to just have a thumbs up/down rating system. opinions are rarely logical and instead are emotional.

if I see a technique, I could easily have the rating of 30% good, 80% bad, 60% unusable rubbish/trash, and 100% this guy is trolling.

therefore, I imagine a system where people can write their own rating text and then give it a value percentage. the popular text ratings (the ones with the most votes) will filter to the top, but it won't exclude people from voicing their opinion about the the thing. some people see potential where others see trash. some people see both.

this kind of emotional information makes for interesting searches and allows for the discovery of all sorts of things, rather than just having the most popular things going to the top.


### dissemination/discovery of ideas

the problem with popular things going to the top method of discovery is that it creates a feedback loop where things can go viral. the other problem is that the user needs to continually be supplied with ever more sensational content. this is going to be very difficult to do on a site dedicated to howto content. I don't imagine why people would use howtube over youtube to consume sensational clickbait.

for example, just for funzies, I could easily see myself doing a search for content with high rubbish and troll ratings just to get a good laugh. I imagine a whole system of "tagging" content will actually be discovered even with strange and opposite combinations -- like, if I search for 50% useless and 50% naughty, what would I encounter?

the other reason why I think a system like this is important is because there are a lot of "diamonds in the rough" ideas that just need a few improvements to them. I don't remember the video, but in one of them, [rob](https://www.youtube.com/c/RobertMurraySmith/videos) was talking about how old electrical books from the late 1800's and early 1900's have a lot of interesting ideas in them that were maybe not relevant for that time but with a few improvements that modern technology offers, those ideas quickly can become relevant.

---

the reaction that I'm getting is that there is a strong opinion that energy ideas should not be allowed to get improvements on them. again, this is a case where the economic forces want to ensure that some ideas are dissuaded and other (useless, IMO) ideas are promoted. if they want to create a whole system designed to bury energy related ideas and promote cooking and life-hacks, that's perfectly fine. this is a perfect example of why I wish to maintain my distance.


### opinion pieces

I derive a lot of inspiration from these ideas from having watched a lot of rob's videos. he often times posts opinion pieces -- and, strangely enough, those are the ones that I tend to watch. I don't believe that opinions are bad -- at all. I think they are very healthy to have, but unhealthy to try and proselytise them.

I think that most opinion pieces are actually motivational speeches in infancy -- because if you think about it, from the builder's perspective, these opinions are often times the evidence of passion or moticvation for doing the work.

they're also very helpful to show one's progress as builder. they give an insight into the mind of the creator. I think that this sort of improvement based approach to the creator should be extended in the future into giving them the ability to show personal progress in a vlog/blog more personal part of them. this is a great marketing tool for the creator/builder because once showing more of their personal side, their opinions carry more relevance.

### graphics kickbacks

if IHTs start to become a thing, it's easy to track the utilisation of graphics and sound resources, such that a IHT could have determined how much each resource is used, and a percent of the monetisation could go to the graphics artists for their work. the better graphics/sounds they make, the more likely they are to be used and therefore the more likely these minute earnings will eventually amount to something big.

in fact, this technique of composing the IHT from many different resources kind of creates a bit of competition -- a sort of arms race to come up with the most suitable media resources to convey an idea.

I'm starting to really like this idea, and it could potentially be very lucrative too. developing...
