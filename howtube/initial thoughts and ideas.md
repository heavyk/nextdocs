# howtube - thoughts and ideas

### introduction

I want to write this out before I begin to look at the present implementation. the reason for this is often times one's initial impression often has many insights that are then later buried under the details of implementation. I consider this more the "ideal" of the concept rather than the implementation of the concept.

### background and motivation

I'm coming at this from an entirely different angle than I did previously. previously, I wanted to create an idea where many different concepts could be presented in a visual and captivating way -- a sort of like interactive wikipedia -- allowing the user to begin to get a bigger and bigger picture until they feel like they grasp the concept.

this idea however is way too far ahead of its time. no one cares about trying to get the bigger picture and there are a lot of forces that *do not* want people to actually see the bigger picture -- so it's sorta like trying to fight the behemoth. it's not worth the effort.

instead, I have noticed that people are very interested in their *performance* in various subjects. this means there is a strong desire to optimise one's technique. in general, I have noticed that one's performance is directly linked to how good one can feel about theirself.

so, in general, the more proficient one becomes at performing certain techniques, the better one can allow themselves to feel. this is directly illustrated in those "life-hacks" videos that were quite the fad for a while. so, from a marketing perspective, the message is, "the better you are at these things, the better you can feel about yourself"

all marketing is linking the product to an emotion (or a mental picture which produces an emotion) -- so, the goal of howtube, I think, would be to try and get people to feel more and more proficient at producing the conditions that they feel they need to have (to feel the way they want to feel -- good about theirselves).

for a lot of people, when they feel good about their ability to *do* something, it ignites a sort of passion in them to do more of it. for example, notice how if you tell a kid that what they're doing is pleasing ("you're doing a good job" "your efforts are very important to some larger goal") -- then, it inspires them to do more of it so they can get that recognition and approval of their efforts. I think the root of this is perception is in one's own belief that they are worthless or good for nothing -- so, to feel like one is capable and accomplished really feels good.

### the interactive howto

one of the things that howtube could leverage in an interactive format like the web is interactive "instructions". the age of static instructions are gone. instead, here, I see a system where graphics (wireframes and schematics) can be dragged around, rotated, moving parts and intactive labels that allow the user to see in more than just 2d the different angles of whatever is being built.

a few months ago we put together a shed and it came with instructions video on how to build it. we were out there with the phone watching the video on how its done. there was a lot of pausing and rewinding. however, if this same video were instead split into two/three parts -- the narration of what needs to be done, along with a 2d/3d schematic of what is being accomplished in that section. then, the final part which was mostly what the video was -- which was a demonstration of it being constructed.

this idea can be expanded and a generic way for all companies large and small to put their instructions up on the site and instead of having to do a custom video and instructions for everything, it will allow companies a format for creating instructions easily.

there's a lot of marketing potential that can be leveraged here as well, because it benefits the manufacturer to have their product's instructions in an easy to access place, while at the same time, each partnership is more free users for howtube.

##### the principal of sharing

I'm putting this idea in its own section because my intuition says it may very important.

for these interactive howtos (IHTs), one thing I think should be pretty important is the ability for others to access and improve upon others' instruction diagrams. not everyone has a super team of graphics designers that can put together a really great presentation. or, for example in the case of geometry, there is no sense that I have to recode all of the things to create the platonic solids -- these sorts of things should become generic things so that people can share and contribute to the library of visual demonstrations of concepts.

there are two major formats available for this -- webgl and svg which are both quite interactive. both of these should be integrated into the presentations allowing for visual demonstrations. I thing at first this should be opt-in, but with visual artists getting their work out there and other people utilising these graphics, I think it will quickly turn into a marketplace of its own. I even propose that just as youtube has a sort of kickback for the content creators, it would be nice if the companies/organisations could reward in some way these improved graphics and techniques to present the most optimum technique.

as this grows, this could become quite lucrative and howtube could become the go-to place for getting presentation graphics.

it also gets a lot of graphics designers moving and producing more and more things. there are other things that most people take for granted like sound effects and voiceover talent. on the subject of sound, I predict a audio syntax or language will begin to form as people begin to converge on the best sound cues for different things (like maybe a ding sound for each important point in the presentation -- or a tick sound for each required ingredient).

##### cornering the life-hacks and cooking markets

it's pretty clear from people's utilisation of pintrest that there is considerable market for cooking and life-hacks sort of things. these markets should be pretty easy.

developing...

### my goals and involvement

I don't really want to be involved that much. I offer all of my ideas and insight for free. I prefer to work on silly little (inconsequential) things, as they continue to lead me toward greater and greater heights of understanding the big picture.

I absolutely love to write out things like this because they force me to begin to put some of these things into manifested thought instead of just a "sense" or an "intuition".

I'd love to continue to write these sorts of things out. I'll likely make another one in a few days after registering and having a look on the site.

this format is sort of an experiment for me. previously, on other teams, I was responsible for too much of the implementation aspects, and I enjoy a lot those sorts of things, as you can tell, I have strong opinions about things about how things should be done. this conflicts with people and I don't want to do that.

I also get too invested in the project myself, and I've found that to continue to see the bigger picture, I prefer to maintain some distance.

this distance does not mean that I'm not invested in the project -- instead, just the opposite. the more twists and turns in the companies drama, the more ideas and solutions I have to come up with. I often see a way of approaching things which does not fit the paradigm (for example the graphics sharing) and I don't want to fight to get my way. implement the ideas the way that best fits the investor's objectives for the company. I don't want the responsibility.

additionally, I don't want to deal with the financial aspect. I have a strong drive to become profitable, and most investors want the company to accrue more and more debt and depend on the investors further. that's a fine thing, but it's not for me. I like my independence. I enjoy doing what I want when I want to do it. I have good insight, because I do things because I want to -- not because I have to.

you have to understand that from a LOA standpoint, the whole objective of the company is all about telling people how to do things. this is very much not at all what I'm about. I'll give my ideas, and I'm sure there are many people that have strong opinions on *how* they should be implemented. those are the people that you'll be attracting gobs and gobs of with this sort of project.

going to take a break now. that's certainly enough to think about
