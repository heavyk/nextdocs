### 2022-12-08 13:55 - egregores and their continuation

as I was [watching the latest video](https://youtu.be/zY8DMV2SY98), he starts out with a discussion on quantum physics, and an elusive "fifth force" of nature that will prove (the existence of) dark matter. I've seen enough suspicious0bservers to know that's a nice way of saying we need more funding, so I'm kinda wonder what point he's making with it. the video continues on with an explanation that "God" is woven into all aspects of nature, and it's this interconnectedness, that does whatever the rest of video is about (haven't got there yet; paused it to write this).

as I was contemplating this, I received a flash explanation for the idea. first, let me build this concept on the foundation that *all of us*, every human -- rather anything that has the "fire of the gods" (the promethian force) -- is the product of someone else's "rightness" we've been instantiated into this world through the creative (sexual) force, and we are all egregors of our parents' and potentially others creation -- from their desire to be right.

many esoteric sex rituals (and other forms of magick) have been carried out to perpetuate a philosophy or an ideology. we can imagine that the sex rituals of the quantum physicists actually produce egregores of our own belief system produced in children that are being born all around the world. we (cause I believe I am an egregore -- a rather strong one created from tantric sex magick) are designed to promulgate the beliefs, philosophies and ideologes produced by the intensity (concepually/emotionally) of the sexual interaction. the intense pleasure experienced literally is a creative power that is determined to ensure that those concepts continue to remain installed in "reality".

all forms of intense emotional and physical sensation produce this creative force -- especially when both, such as pleasure/pain and a strong conceptual position such as hatred are perceived simultaneously -- and it's these summonings (like the promethian concept of the destruction of an empire combined with physical pain) which produces these "egregores" which are our concepts becoming manifest. these created children will "carry the torch" of the concept into the next generation of people. this is most obvious with the phenomenon of YHVH (which I believe is prometheus' antithesis -- and the promethian idea lives on because YHVH is against it). gonna continue the video now...

### 2022-12-08 14:21 - re-explain scientifically

intense conceptual focus happens with the aid of physical stimulants such as drugs, sex, ecstatic dancing, etc. changes your timeline. we believe the world in relatively constant, but because you're not conscious for 100% of the time, there are things that can be moved around while you're unconscious. the world itself is a self-transforming concept because of it's rotation, and it's rotation, from a conceptual standpoint is its perception of itself. nobody is ever paying attention to the whole world at the same time (not even nosebook, because until machines are capable of desire, they don't count).

nosebook and all calculatory/formulaic/symbolic structures don't count because they're instantians are finine and so therefore appear as static from that (3rd ray) perspective -- reemember that both 2nd ray and 4th ray perceive the 3rd ray perspective. as an example, let's imagine a machine that countsx things. for the machine, the count is a number (and all finine numbers are possible, minus the ones disallowed by the formula). so, if on this timeline there are 100 things, and on another timeline there are 200 things, the machines on each timeline will have properly counted everything according to their programming *on that timeline*.

machines don't move between timelines like we do, because they don't have the fire (desire to be right) like we do, so they don't *move to anothter timeline* where *they're right* (see what I mean?). now, let's look at the concept from the prerspective of a medium: machines are like rock where they don't really move and long processes erode them, the unconscious masses are the liquid, flowing about in cycles as determined by the lord of the storm, and the conscious ones (promethius - 2nd ray) are the ones that move around, some with more ablity than others, in the medium of "time" (saturn - 4th ray).
