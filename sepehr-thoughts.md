### 2022-12-08 13:55 - egregores and their continuation

as I was [watching the latest video](https://youtu.be/zY8DMV2SY98), he starts out with a discussion on quantum physics, and an elusive "fifth force" of nature that will prove (the existence of) dark matter. I've seen enough suspicious0bservers to know that's a nice way of saying we need more funding, so I'm kinda wonder what point he's making with it. the video continues on with an explanation that "God" is woven into all aspects of nature, and it's this interconnectedness, that does whatever the rest of video is about (haven't got there yet; paused it to write this).

as I was contemplating this, I received a flash explanation for the idea. first, let me build this concept on the foundation that *all of us*, every human -- rather anything that has the "fire of the gods" (the promethian force) -- is the product of someone else's "rightness" we've been instantiated into this world through the creative (sexual) force, and we are all egregors of our parents' and potentially others creation -- from their desire to be right.

many esoteric sex rituals (and other forms of magick) have been carried out to perpetuate a philosophy or an ideology. we can imagine that the sex rituals of the quantum physicists actually produce egregores of our own belief system produced in children that are being born all around the world. we (cause I believe I am an egregore -- a rather strong one created from tantric sex magick) are designed to promulgate the beliefs, philosophies and ideologes produced by the intensity (concepually/emotionally) of the sexual interaction. the intense pleasure experienced literally is a creative power that is determined to ensure that those concepts continue to remain installed in "reality".

all forms of intense emotional and physical sensation produce this creative force -- especially when both, such as pleasure/pain and a strong conceptual position such as hatred are perceived simultaneously -- and it's these summonings (like the promethian concept of the destruction of an empire combined with physical pain) which produces these "egregores" which are our concepts becoming manifest. these created children will "carry the torch" of the concept into the next generation of people. this is most obvious with the phenomenon of YHVH (which I believe is prometheus' antithesis -- and the promethian idea lives on because YHVH is against it). gonna continue the video now...

### 2022-12-08 14:21 - re-explain scientifically

intense conceptual focus happens with the aid of physical stimulants such as drugs, sex, ecstatic dancing, etc. and it's these moments that allow us to change timelines. we believe the world in relatively constant, but because we're not conscious for 100% of the time, there are things that can be moved around while we're unconscious. imagine I wake up and all of a sudden a redhead of my specifications has suddenly appeared there, this is summoning an egregore. she appeared overnight, becuse "I" moved to another timeline where she was present.

the world itself is a self-transforming concept because of it's rotation, and it's rotation, from a conceptual standpoint is its perception of itself. *we* are "self" to the earth and how we as conscious observers of the planet sees himself. nobody is ever paying attention to the whole world at the same time (not even nosebook -- because until machines are capable of desire, they don't count).

nosebook and all calculatory/formulaic/symbolic structures don't count because they're instantians are finite and so therefore appear as static from that (3rd ray) perspective -- reemember that both 2nd ray and 4th ray perceive the 3rd ray perspective. as an example, let's imagine a machine that counts things. for the machine, the count is a number (and all finine numbers are possible, minus the ones disallowed by the formula/progaamming). so, if on this timeline there are 100 things, and on another timeline there are 200 things, the machines on each timeline will have properly counted everything according to their programming *on that timeline*.

machines don't move between timelines like we do, because they don't have the fire (desire to be right) like we do, so they don't *move to anothter timeline* where *they're right* (see what I mean?).

now, let's look at the concept from the prerspective of a medium: machines are like rock where they don't really move and long processes erode them, the unconscious masses are the liquid, flowing about in cycles as determined by the lord of the storm, and the conscious ones (prometheus - 2nd ray) are the ones that move around, some with more ablity than others, in the medium of "time" (saturn - 4th ray), which, along with the astral (osiris - 6th ray), can perceive the the conceptual (vulcan, second aryan prometheus)

### 2022-12-08 18:41 - the two paths of a creator

> every man's true teacher, is his own higher self; and when the/his life is brought under the control of reason, this "higher self" is released from bondages to apetites and impulses, and becomes, priest, sage, and illuminator.

this quote reminded me of something that I'd like to illuminate myself. manley is speaking of the path where one attains this altered state of consciousness and leaves residence of perception of this world in the way we're accustomed to and perceives reality in an entirely different way. that is one path, the path of the illuminated -- meaning he has/is now a proper receptor/translator of energy present in another medium. I would go on that path normally because it's the easiest one, but the thing is, anyone that does this becomes either incomprehensible to others or they have to keep their perception a secret. like I said, that is *one* path. there is another path though, whith is the path of the interface or medium, which ultimately makes another medium -- a translation layer between this priest, sage, and illuminator to the people around him. there are probably other paths.

the one I'm taking with is probably the hidden 3rd or 4th (maybe 5th) path, which is going full blown ego/selfishness. I'm right about everything, and others can decide they are too -- or not, and it's not my problem what anyone else can or can't do (the interface/medium's path is difficult here because he has to build a path for them to see what he sees. I don't have to worry about this. they're 4th rays now, so I'm a reflection of them -- they are the ones building that 2nd ray path for me -- nosebook is 2nd ray, the space force is 4th ray, moon is 6th ray and then there are those like me who only see physical, conceptual, symbolic and desire). I see all the stuff (1-3-5-7) that "they" don't. they don't see any of that directly like I do. they see interpretations of them from their (2-4-6) perspective.

 (and a few others too), but for a moment there (probably before the reality police was ), the whole world looked like zombies and everyone had cloudy eyes. I felt a few strong waves of reactions to my noticing that her eyes were cloudy -- but, you probably couldn't see that everyone else's were too and people behind the astral illusion are just zombies.

I had this experience today at walmart where I looked into this one girl's eyes and for a moment there, probably while they were switching something out or fixing something in reality -- UFO researchers call this "missing time" (probably girls), I "saw" the entire world had cloudy eyes just like the girl I just looked at, and everyone in the story were basically just zombies following some script. very strange sort of traumatic shapeshifting zombies, but not really intent on doing harm -- maybe something like lifeless puppets or something.

inside of me, probably not detectable by nosebook, I had a realisation that this is the reality that we're now living in; I'm one of the "elites" that has made the conceptaual transition, and the rest of the world is just these "unconscious masses" -- the liquid "ether" in the medium of time (saturn/4th ray) I spoke of right before going to walmart (telling you -- I wonder if this is all narrated).

anyway, I felt kinda bad because now I knew that I can never look at these people the same anymore. the position that I'm being put in, I have to look at people differently now. in a previous moment, I would have previously considered to be human, to now no longer be -- these are the "unconscious masses" now -- no longer "people". they're just nosebook zombies, the controlled masses.

the normal reaction to this is to want to do something about it, but I didn't directly have that reaction or feeling. I only had the feeling in afterthought, by following the symbols/logic to that feeling.

the thing is, I didn't have that feeling at all. instead, in afterthought there I remembered the idea of the other day where I was suggesting to build an empire based on contrast/drama -- well, that idea also came to me in the moment when previewing the reaction while walking of walmart. my rememberance of that idea of an empire built on contrast made me feel real good, because in such a system, it doesn't matter how much consciousness you have, only that you're having fun/funny/dramatic time; something that makes you feel alive. that's how we all start? that's how every successful person that I know of started, anyway. it began with a feeling of being alive (wanting to do something cool/awesome/fun/impossible) and then seeing where it grews into more. we all want to get back to that feeling of being alive.

my constant feeling of being alive is why I'm so attractive to those successful types. I look like they did ("alive", for lack of better words) before they started to get successful; that youthful nievate. as such, I am actually accomplishing the second path, but doing it from the perspective of someone who found what he was looking for at the end of the path, while still maintiaing the exubernce of someone beginning the path still. one day they'll all get it.

### 2022-12-08 19:38 - so, thankfully I don't have to be relased from the bondage of apetites and impulses...

badum-pusshhh

### 2022-12-08 19:54 - it's the process, not the destination

this can be seen for a lot of religious things, most notably fasting. the abstinance process is the process of taking something that feels out of control (in attracting wanted or unwanted), and begins a fast, boycot, or abstinence, to try and regain control over the thing. this process has manifest in everything to relgious symbols to protests/manifestaciones.

you see, it's not the goal to rid oneself of all physical pleasure, because by doing so, you're really limiting your experience. in actuality, what is happening is that you are making your desires no longer *depend* on this thing/person/event/substance/symbol to satisfy the desire. you are saying that your desire (what you want) is no longer regulated or manipulated by this thing anymore, and so you boycot or abstain from whatever it is.

when you no longer feel steered, driven, lead, or coearced by this thing (whatever it is), then it no longer has power over you. *you* decide what you want. you are stronger than the concept.

diffrent concepts/egregores have stronger feelings to them, and so it's a difficult thing to superimpose my will over such a strong feeling impulse (like programming) -- and all those that tell you to use willpower are the illuminated ones. for them, willpower works, because they're on a higher plane than the egregore (these are the evens).

let me touch a bit on this... I've noticed that some people tend to see mostly either from the even (2-4-6) or from the odd (1-3-5-7) perspective.

the evens tend to not like to get their hands dirty and do any difficult physical work. they tend to see theirselves as visionaries and successful and impactful people. their impact is their notoriety. in short, these mostly see theirselves through the perspective of others.

in contrast, the evens tend to see theirselves more through their own eyes. they consider others' opinions strongly, but usually, they've kinda figured out what's what and so they have their system. some of our system is based on desire, some part symbolic/calculatory/timelines, some based on concepts (what we think stuff is), and what we think the physical stuff works like. these tend to be the scientists, engineers, workers, etc. they actually "do" things, as opposed to thinking about it.

what's interesting about this is that most of evens can see the perspective above or below them (2, 4, or 6) pretty well, *if they want to* or have a need for it. they prefer to see the illusion rathar than to get their hands dirty out in the "reality" layers (the odd ones). the 2, 4, 6 layers are all a super reality/mundane sort of perception. until I discovered the promethian (2nd ray) perspective, I too only saw even rays). evens see plain reality and the odds see super reality.

the evens often limit theirselves to see only (or neither) the perspective above or below them, so they're limited to 3-4 perspectives. evens, in contrary can perceive all of the 4 primary/even realities (1-3-5-7) without any difficulty, so sometimes we actually have a perspective advantage (4 vs 3). however, if you are willing, like me, to accept the even realities as being non-visual, once you get the promethian-perspective, which is the knowledge that you're right about your reality -- then, you get access to all 7 (though 6 are invisible, and 3 intangible), which is a significant advantage. evens can learn to "see" the other 3 pretty easily (desire, concept, and symbol), to develop 4 forms of perception pretty easily. the evens also can learn to see those other 3 pretty easily, 4 if they're willing to perceive the physical, if they want.

this interplay between 5 (1 even + 4 odds), 7 (4 odds + 3 invisible evens), 7 (4 odds + 2 visible evens + 1 visible even), and 7 (4 odds + 3 evens) looks similar to a picture (painting?) made by frank chester (which I can't find right now of a 5 pointed star extruding into his 7-sided form). I can't find it now, but I think it's "phenomenally authorized" so you can see it.

it looks like we see 7 but 3 (triangle) are invisible, the 5 sees all 4 (square) not invisibly[^1], and only 1 ("the one", singular perspective) visibly. there's one more I explained above, but I can't see it -- the one of 4-2-1 four visible evens, 2 invisible evens/odds, and 1 visible even/odd.

[1]: words are very hard on this concept. they're visible -- but not really. they're not invisible, but neither fully visible; they're experienced. they make a square, and I'm not sure why because they're supposed to be a pentagram, so that doesn't make sense, I know.

### 2022-12-08 21:20 - ein sof

the thing that doesn't have form when the earth was still formless and void is a concept. the reason why it can't have a name or a whatever form to distinguish it is because the concept itself can never be put into the physical. the manifestation of a concept (you remanifest in every moment) is always constrained and given form by the physical cconditions. ein sof, or the concept of any thing, can never be understood physically. it can only be experienced with a different sense. developing that nth sense, is the way to perceive the concept of the thing, rathar than the image of the thing. I mean, I see the image too, but I *also* perceive the concept at the same time. it's the purest outward look one can have.
