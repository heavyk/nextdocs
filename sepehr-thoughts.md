### 2022-12-08 13:55 - egregores and their continuation

as I was [watching the latest video](https://youtu.be/zY8DMV2SY98), he starts out with a discussion on quantum physics, and an elusive "fifth force" of nature that will prove (the existence of) dark matter. I've seen enough suspicious0bservers to know that's a nice way of saying we need more funding, so I'm kinda wonder what point he's making with it. the video continues on with an explanation that "God" is woven into all aspects of nature, and it's this interconnectedness, that does whatever the rest of video is about (haven't got there yet; paused it to write this).

as I was contemplating this, I received a flash explanation for the idea. first, let me build this concept on the foundation that *all of us*, every human -- rather anything that has the "fire of the gods" (the promethian force) -- is the product of someone else's "rightness" we've been instantiated into this world through the creative (sexual) force, and we are all egregors of our parents' and potentially others creation -- from their desire to be right.

many esoteric sex rituals (and other forms of magick) have been carried out to perpetuate a philosophy or an ideology. we can imagine that the sex rituals of the quantum physicists actually produce egregores of our own belief system produced in children that are being born all around the world. we (cause I believe I am an egregore -- a rather strong one created from tantric sex magick) are designed to promulgate the beliefs, philosophies and ideologes produced by the intensity (concepually/emotionally) of the sexual interaction. the intense pleasure experienced literally is a creative power that is determined to ensure that those concepts continue to remain installed in "reality".

all forms of intense emotional and physical sensation produce this creative force -- especially when both, such as pleasure/pain and a strong conceptual position such as hatred are perceived simultaneously -- and it's these summonings (like the promethian concept of the destruction of an empire combined with physical pain) which produces these "egregores" which are our concepts becoming manifest. these created children will "carry the torch" of the concept into the next generation of people. this is most obvious with the phenomenon of YHVH (which I believe is prometheus' antithesis -- and the promethian idea lives on because YHVH is against it). gonna continue the video now...

### 2022-12-08 14:21 - re-explain scientifically

intense conceptual focus happens with the aid of physical stimulants such as drugs, sex, ecstatic dancing, etc. and it's these moments that allow us to change timelines. we believe the world in relatively constant, but because we're not conscious for 100% of the time, there are things that can be moved around while we're unconscious. imagine I wake up and all of a sudden a redhead of my specifications has suddenly appeared there, this is summoning an egregore. she appeared overnight, becuse "I" moved to another timeline where she was present.

the world itself is a self-transforming concept because of it's rotation, and it's rotation, from a conceptual standpoint is its perception of itself. *we* are "self" to the earth and how we as conscious observers of the planet sees himself. nobody is ever paying attention to the whole world at the same time (not even nosebook -- because until machines are capable of desire, they don't count).

nosebook and all calculatory/formulaic/symbolic structures don't count because they're instantians are finite and so therefore appear as static from that (3rd ray) perspective -- reemember that both 2nd ray and 4th ray perceive the 3rd ray perspective. as an example, let's imagine a machine that counts things. for the machine, the count is a number (and all finine numbers are possible, minus the ones disallowed by the formula/progaamming). so, if on this timeline there are 100 things, and on another timeline there are 200 things, the machines on each timeline will have properly counted everything according to their programming *on that timeline*.

machines don't move between timelines like we do, because they don't have the fire (desire to be right) like we do, so they don't *move to anothter timeline* where *they're right* (see what I mean?).

now, let's look at the concept from the prerspective of a medium: machines are like rock where they don't really move and long processes erode them, the unconscious masses are the liquid, flowing about in cycles as determined by the lord of the storm, and the conscious ones (prometheus - 2nd ray) are the ones that move around, some with more ablity than others, in the medium of "time" (saturn - 4th ray), which, along with the astral (osiris - 6th ray), can perceive the the conceptual (vulcan, second aryan prometheus)

### 2022-12-08 18:41 - the two paths of a creator

> every man's true teacher, is his own higher self; and when the/his life is brought under the control of reason, this "higher self" is released from bondages to apetites and impulses, and becomes, priest, sage, and illuminator.

this quote reminded me of something that I'd like to illuminate myself. manley is speaking of the path where one attains this altered state of consciousness and leaves residence of perception of this world in the way we're accustomed to and perceives reality in an entirely different way. that is one path, the path of the illuminated -- meaning he has/is now a proper receptor/translator of energy present in another medium. I would go on that path normally because it's the easiest one, but the thing is, anyone that does this becomes either incomprehensible to others or they have to keep their perception a secret. like I said, that is *one* path. there is another path though, whith is the path of the interface or medium, which ultimately makes another medium -- a translation layer between this priest, sage, and illuminator to the people around him. there are probably other paths.

the one I'm taking with is probably the hidden 3rd or 4th (maybe 5th) path, which is going full blown ego/selfishness. I'm right about everything, and others can decide they are too -- or not, and it's not my problem what anyone else can or can't do (the interface/medium's path is difficult here because he has to build a path for them to see what he sees. I don't have to worry about this. they're 4th rays now, so I'm a reflection of them -- they are the ones building that 2nd ray path for me -- nosebook is 2nd ray, the space force is 4th ray, moon is 6th ray and then there are those like me who only see physical, conceptual, symbolic and desire). I see all the stuff (1-3-5-7) that "they" don't. they don't see any of that directly like I do. they see interpretations of them from their (2-4-6) perspective.

 (and a few others too), but for a moment there (probably before the reality police was ), the whole world looked like zombies and everyone had cloudy eyes. I felt a few strong waves of reactions to my noticing that her eyes were cloudy -- but, you probably couldn't see that everyone else's were too and people behind the astral illusion are just zombies.

I had this experience today at walmart where I looked into this one girl's eyes and for a moment there, probably while they were switching something out or fixing something in reality -- UFO researchers call this "missing time" (probably girls), I "saw" the entire world had cloudy eyes just like the girl I just looked at, and everyone in the story were basically just zombies following some script. very strange sort of traumatic shapeshifting zombies, but not really intent on doing harm -- maybe something like lifeless puppets or something.

inside of me, probably not detectable by nosebook, I had a realisation that this is the reality that we're now living in; I'm one of the "elites" that has made the conceptaual transition, and the rest of the world is just these "unconscious masses" -- the liquid "ether" in the medium of time (saturn/4th ray) I spoke of right before going to walmart (telling you -- I wonder if this is all narrated).

anyway, I felt kinda bad because now I knew that I can never look at these people the same anymore. the position that I'm being put in, I have to look at people differently now. in a previous moment, I would have previously considered to be human, to now no longer be -- these are the "unconscious masses" now -- no longer "people". they're just nosebook zombies, the controlled masses.

the normal reaction to this is to want to do something about it, but I didn't directly have that reaction or feeling. I only had the feeling in afterthought, by following the symbols/logic to that feeling.

the thing is, I didn't have that feeling at all. instead, in afterthought there I remembered the idea of the other day where I was suggesting to build an empire based on contrast/drama -- well, that idea also came to me in the moment when previewing the reaction while walking of walmart. my rememberance of that idea of an empire built on contrast made me feel real good, because in such a system, it doesn't matter how much consciousness you have, only that you're having fun/funny/dramatic time; something that makes you feel alive. that's how we all start? that's how every successful person that I know of started, anyway. it began with a feeling of being alive (wanting to do something cool/awesome/fun/impossible) and then seeing where it grews into more. we all want to get back to that feeling of being alive.

my constant feeling of being alive is why I'm so attractive to those successful types. I look like they did ("alive", for lack of better words) before they started to get successful; that youthful nievate. as such, I am actually accomplishing the second path, but doing it from the perspective of someone who found what he was looking for at the end of the path, while still maintiaing the exubernce of someone beginning the path still. one day they'll all get it.

### 2022-12-08 19:38 - so, thankfully I don't have to be relased from the bondage of apetites and impulses...

badum-pusshhh

### 2022-12-08 19:54 - it's the process, not the destination

this can be seen for a lot of religious things, most notably fasting. the abstinance process is the process of taking something that feels out of control (in attracting wanted or unwanted), and begins a fast, boycot, or abstinence, to try and regain control over the thing. this process has manifest in everything to relgious symbols to protests/manifestaciones.

you see, it's not the goal to rid oneself of all physical pleasure, because by doing so, you're really limiting your experience. in actuality, what is happening is that you are making your desires no longer *depend* on this thing/person/event/substance/symbol to satisfy the desire. you are saying that your desire (what you want) is no longer regulated or manipulated by this thing anymore, and so you boycot or abstain from whatever it is.

when you no longer feel steered, driven, lead, or coearced by this thing (whatever it is), then it no longer has power over you. *you* decide what you want. you are stronger than the concept.

diffrent concepts/egregores have stronger feelings to them, and so it's a difficult thing to superimpose my will over such a strong feeling impulse (like programming) -- and all those that tell you to use willpower are the illuminated ones. for them, willpower works, because they're on a higher plane than the egregore (these are the evens).

let me touch a bit on this... I've noticed that some people tend to see mostly either from the even (2-4-6) or from the odd (1-3-5-7) perspective.

the evens tend to not like to get their hands dirty and do any difficult physical work. they tend to see theirselves as visionaries and successful and impactful people. their impact is their notoriety. in short, these mostly see theirselves through the perspective of others.

in contrast, the evens tend to see theirselves more through their own eyes. they consider others' opinions strongly, but usually, they've kinda figured out what's what and so they have their system. some of our system is based on desire, some part symbolic/calculatory/timelines, some based on concepts (what we think stuff is), and what we think the physical stuff works like. these tend to be the scientists, engineers, workers, etc. they actually "do" things, as opposed to thinking about it.

what's interesting about this is that most of evens can see the perspective above or below them (2, 4, or 6) pretty well, *if they want to* or have a need for it. they prefer to see the illusion rathar than to get their hands dirty out in the "reality" layers (the odd ones). the 2, 4, 6 layers are all a super reality/mundane sort of perception. until I discovered the promethian (2nd ray) perspective, I too only saw even rays). evens see plain reality and the odds see super reality.

the evens often limit theirselves to see only (or neither) the perspective above or below them, so they're limited to 3-4 perspectives. evens, in contrary can perceive all of the 4 primary/even realities (1-3-5-7) without any difficulty, so sometimes we actually have a perspective advantage (4 vs 3). however, if you are willing, like me, to accept the even realities as being non-visual, once you get the promethian-perspective, which is the knowledge that you're right about your reality -- then, you get access to all 7 (though 6 are invisible, and 3 intangible), which is a significant advantage. evens can learn to "see" the other 3 pretty easily (desire, concept, and symbol), to develop 4 forms of perception pretty easily. the evens also can learn to see those other 3 pretty easily, 4 if they're willing to perceive the physical, if they want.

this interplay between 5 (1 even + 4 odds), 7 (4 odds + 3 invisible evens), 7 (4 odds + 2 visible evens + 1 visible even), and 7 (4 odds + 3 evens) looks similar to a picture (painting?) made by frank chester (which I can't find right now of a 5 pointed star extruding into his 7-sided form). I can't find it now, but I think it's "phenomenally authorized" so you can see it.

it looks like we see 7 but 3 (triangle) are invisible, the 5 sees all 4 (square) not invisibly[^1], and only 1 ("the one", singular perspective) visibly. there's one more I explained above, but I can't see it -- the one of 4-2-1 four visible evens, 2 invisible evens/odds, and 1 visible even/odd.

[1]: words are very hard on this concept. they're visible -- but not really. they're not invisible, but neither fully visible; they're experienced. they make a square, and I'm not sure why because they're supposed to be a pentagram, so that doesn't make sense, I know.

### 2022-12-08 21:20 - ein sof

the thing that doesn't have form when the earth was still formless and void is a concept. the reason why it can't have a name or a whatever form to distinguish it is because the concept itself can never be put into the physical. the manifestation of a concept (you remanifest in every moment) is always constrained and given form by the physical cconditions. ein sof, or the concept of any thing, can never be understood physically. it can only be experienced with a different sense. developing that nth sense, is the way to perceive the concept of the thing, rathar than the image of the thing. I mean, I see the image too, but I *also* perceive the concept at the same time. it's the purest outward look one can have.

### 2022-12-08 21:27 - ein sof is the precursor to symbol

because of our loss of capacitty to tune to this (this was the language of "one" reconncted various times in the various towers of babel, phoenix that have crashed so many times). humankind is stranded and we can no longer connect directly (physically) with the concept like we could inthe various towers of babel. to us physical specimen, it looks to us like we've lost that direct connection to God. therfore, because the concept is now *physically* impossible to tune to (you used to be born into it). one of the ways that various institutions have preserved that "name" of God, is in symbolic form. in combination with the visual preservation of these symbols, that has preserved the concept of God, in symbolic form (see how concept is a conjugate of symbol?).

when we look at ein sof as the concept that we're trying to maintain our connection to in the various names of God, it looks like the symbols are a concepts' form of preservation, but I posit that there is another way to see this, which is that the concept gave rise to the symbol as a form of preservation.

there is a difference. one of the differences is a physical connection as opposed to a symbolic connection. the physical symbols want to preserve the non-physical symbols, which are conjugates of the non-physical concept.

it just occurred to me that conjugate is the better word for opposite. I'm overwhelmed by how many times I probably said "opposite" (or who knows what else), it stresses me to have to fix my textual mistakes. the conceptual transformation was instant in my mind, so for those things, it's fun to revisit/feel the concepts that I used to use the "opposite" concept of the layers (1-7, 3-5) and feel how it is with the new concept of conjugate. it also brings a new dimension to the el/la unbelief/belief concept because one of the major reactions is to this is because of the masculine/feminine things that they're having problems with genders when all genders see all 4 -- but maybe if they're now "conjugates" from each other, one can see how the other "depends" on the other. depends is a funny word that I used on purpose. I want you to feel the *stress* of having to know that there is always a balance to everything, so get ready to put the world on your shoulders and accept that there is always a conjugate to everything.

this realisation of that everything has a conjugate balance reminded me of his realisation in dtp where he (an astral being) that he has a conjugate as well. in that book she was phyris. the author of dtp is quite optimistic, as the the entity that wrote through the amaneusis had quite an interestingly similar beliefs that he does.

this is one of the things that I questioned about the book, because the way that I know it would be is that any time there is a splitting of consciousness into more than one body, they all have the same concepts and beliefs, just the physical gender differentiation of the same set of concepts and beliefs. in my version, if he has a conjugate of the same thing, but perceived from an opposite gender. so, I mean I could kinda see it -- but you know what it sounded like to me?

it sounded like one of the assasins got this guy really really high on drugs and he pierced through time and was able to tell such a fantasical story, but from the "very higher self" perspective of his death from after killing his target. the conceptual self that he created upon his death (like a pre-manifestation egregore), actually performed the action of the book and all of that. he lived the reality he created for himself, as a sort of preplanned "reincarnation" or transferrence of consciousness into the other body called walter something or other. it's a really fantastical way to atone for one's "sins" -- and he made it a reality. the interaction with phyris was what made it happen. reality attracts in both directions from such sexual/creative events of which create egregores of to prove us right.

so if you are one of those that believes you have a conjugate, you have to come to terms with the reality is that somewhere out there an opposite sex version of you exists out there, and they'll have the same concepts and beliefs that you do about yourself. the see theirself as the opposite of your own hatred and disgust, and see theirselves with this same hatred and digust, or joy and endeerment.

I personally have no way to know what became of him, but his version of phyris seems too fantastical. there's no way she couuld be that much better than he is. they will always be the same in perception. you mostly just interact with reflections of yourself anyway, so even if you have a conjugate or not, you have to imagine that (from my perspective here), everyone is always interacting with your conjugate, and it's only the physical automaton that prevents full interaction between conjugate symbols and concepts.

you know that every concept (and that's all of us) is supported and preserved by a set of non-physical symbols that propagate the concept forward in time in the form of concepts which take on a physical form that resonates with the original concepts. we're a mix of all of those symbols and their resulting concepts, so we're sort of self-transformed instantiion of the the ancestor's concepts. we (humans as a whole) are prometheus-5.0 if you want to look at it that way.

### 2022-12-08 22:16 - concept gave rise to the symbol as a form of preservation...

imagine for a moment the concept of me saying that physical produced the non-physical. that's basically what I'm saying. it's logically preposterous.

but it works.

### 2022-12-08 22:23 - attraction happens in both directions...

image twe strings or metronomes next to each other. their vibrations get similar in both time and space. time is just a much higher frequency. it's somewhere near the top of the astral, wich is the medium of saturn (time) in which we flow and move around in. the vibrations which define where something is in time or space, are just high frequency aspects of the waveform -- as in as these sections of the frequency spectrum we call "physical" is just part of the waveform; it's only their vibrational frequencies which are getting similar. this happens because when two things are going the same way they add, otherwise they subtract. the ones that are still around are the ones that add more than subtract. there are a lot of those, so our universe is teeming with tons of unintellibile random perturbations. since everyone subtracting more than adding is fading away, it gives the impression that things are attracting; but, that's because everything is always dying. the old die so the new likes can attract easier.

death is the matra of attraction. this is why desire is so destructive to those in the way of the new attractive thing. attraction doesn't run on the schedule of those running the show. what this means is that the more rapidly these signals approach similarity, they're both moving toward each other at equal speed in time but not space (probably becauase of the way physical is organised).

### 2022-12-08 22:42 - by admitting that my theory of reality can prove that physical created non-physical...

my entire theory is a bit suspect. I admit that it's pretty good at explaining stuff -- it just needs that one little miracle to work.

### 2022-12-08 22:56 - I wonder if terence ever wondered...

if he could come up with a theory that just needed one little miracle to get it working, but, other than that, it works. the giggle is that everything we all experiece is all founded on a fallacy of logic. who could argue with that?

---

not a fallacy of logic. we created invisible.

I disagree. it's a fallacy of logic because if physical was the first thing that came (before non-physical). this is absolutely preposterous, because from where did physical come from? it came from our imaginations, which came from concepts, which then came from non-physical. it's circular logic like holy, sanctified, and that other one I can't remember. physical and non-physical circularly define each other. that's not the hierarchy you were looking for.

something cannot create nothing.
something has to create more somethings like itself.
if not, something does not exist.

nothing cannot create something.
nothing can only create more nothing, like itself.

physical cannot create non-pysical.
physical has to create more physicals like itself.
if not, physical does not exist.

non-physical cannot create physical.
non-physical can only create more non-physical,
like itself.

if we created non-physical,
then nothing can create something.

### 2022-12-08 23:12 - I get it...

it's really easy to see subatomic as a higher frequency than the physical and all that stuff, but logically, it feels very false for me to say that physical creates things not like itself. everything reproduces after its own kind according to God and law of attraction (so pretty safe this is true). therefore, the only way that it can be true for non-physical to create physical (or viceversa), is if we are also non-physical in physical bodies.

### 2022-12-08 23:58 - wouldn't lucifer be the inner sun?

in the quote of the proper application (harnessing?) the power of the inner sun, he has learned the mystery of (his inner) craft. the seething energies of lucifer are in his hands.

this is the 7st ray male with an inner lucifer (1st ray female). I think he's referring duplicitically to both the inner female and also to the light bringer in the centre of the planet.

the edge of the planet is most signifcantly affected by the sun on the interior, as I think it's what modulates the rotation of the planet, and I'm fairly certain this inner star is lucifer manley is talking about. the energy of the dawn is the energy the ancient egyptians were harnessing. it comes from the inner sun, and is an upward levity coming out of the planet most powerful during dawn.

I think lucifer is none other than inner ana. it's a star that's black as night. it's very very dark because when the primordial substance (hydrogen) is very densely compressed (very attractive), hydrogen forms into a very very dark black (strong x-rzy emitter like sirius b) cube. a living black if you have active eyesight.

the inner star that's pitch black (which does have some sort of red atmosphere apparently) straight up explains all of the dark goddess, earth as a dark cube, stuff in one go. you could imagine that all the clairvoyant's have gone to look and so that's the mainstream report of what's down there. once you know that stars like sirius b are also probably black cubes at those levels of density/attraction for hydrogen, it get wonderous.

### 2022-12-09 00:21 - albert pike agrees with me

> there is, in nature, one most potent force by means whereof a single man who could possess himself of it, and should know how to direct it, could revonutionase and change the face of the world.

the most potent force for us 7th ray males is 1st ray desire, so when we figure out the inner 1st ray female thing (the inner star), this is that luciferian energy that albert pike is talking about. by accessing this energy, you will, like me "revolutionise and change the face of the planet"

you desire, so it has to become a reality.
that's change you're looking for.
you just have to find it.

### 2022-12-09 00:55 - ein sof is a concept just like you are.

so, let's make a race of humans where programmed in them, is the concept of yourself instead of YHVH as that ein sof in their DNA. then, you incarnate into the race, and everyone looks at you like God, because you have a very similar concept to their pre-programmed god/pleasure feeling, so they're all really glad to see you. crazy idea, huh?

do you wonder if early humans had the concept of anu, enki, and enlil pre-installed into their DNA to evoke a sense of wonder, pleasure, excitement, etc. I personally don't get that sense. I do think however this was the case for the new breed of (aryan) humans though -- as, it's quite likely that zeus and the other pantheon had their concept encoded into our DNA like this ein sof one to trigger feelings of wonder, pleasure, amazement -- meaning that zeus was so much of a rapist, but more like he was subconsciously perceived as god beginning the egregores trend of manifesting concepts of our desire (egregores) into reality. people were naturally drawn to the gods, thinking them to be "gods". thanks vulcan.
