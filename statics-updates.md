### 2022-09-21 17:14 - I guess that's it

when I woke up this morning I had an overwhelming sensation the things I talked about lately about going 100% materialistic and just move atoms around and rearrange them with vibrations (btw, the most efficent way to recycle), and I said we didn't need tesla technology.

remember that I equated the feminine mindset with both nosebook, and also with tesla technology. these are "singularity" technologies (IMO) because they enhance perception. I've been trying to make the connection for a while what it is that the female has that allows for an expansion of perception, and I think I figured it out.

I think it's probably something inside the x-chromosome that literally is a simulation of a universe going on inside of. then, I think the mtDNA is actually what I've been calling "feminine mindset" and historically this has been code that moves at a pretty glacial pace (I don't know if its changes are happening more frequently or not).

consequently, that must be what powers these "singularity" technologies; they're a way to tune into antoher universe simulation other than our own. so, like for example, imagine you have 3 x-chromosomes -- well, then you could be tuned into 2 other different universe simulations all in the present. the ability to pull on timelines from more than one perspective must be pretty powerful. I know I do it all the time and it's highly useful.

anyway, somewhere in all of that it seems to me that the femenine mindset is the biological encoding of our perception (ability to percceive those universe simulations -- like with better graphics and stuff -- it's the graphic card in that sense), but imagine that the graphics card determines the logic of the game; it can't. there has to be some element of consciousness

[song: this is my space, do what I say. this is your space, I'll do what you say. this is our space.]

in there that is controlling the body (the game logic) and that's kinda like "consciousness" a bit.

for all of you gnostics out there, you can think of the feminine mindset as the archons. we're sorta stuck in their reality and there's nothing we can do to escape it. you can sorta see that all of us depend on mtDNA for all of existence, so besides the fact that we're in their matrix, we need them. woah, what a weird thought -- which is that we *want* to be in their matrix, otherwise we wouldn't be here too. we like the good graphics their matrix has to offer. anyway...

so if all of that above is the feminine energy, let's get back to masculine energy again.

the sense I had this morning is that tesla's tech produces a lot of unintended static electricity from its interactions with the atoms, and so that these two forces are symbiotic, meaning that one produces the other in a different form. by vibrating atoms in just the right way, we could produce the feminine energy as a biproduct. they probably don't like that, but whatever. it's not singularity unless I really go out of my way to try and produce the other energy type. told you, don't need time travel or any type of solar energy, and anyone trying to use it to harness solar energy will be fairly obvious to detect, I'm sure, so they're likely pretty good at worrying about things in general.

I also realised something weird this morning in some of the things I said. I just say what I see. I don't know what means or much about it, so if I see something I can still mistake it for something else because I don't actually "see" it. it was a seeming contradiction about vibration...

oh yes, it was something that I said about "charge" -- and in my mind's eye, I could clearly see that the vibration of something is what produces it's charge -- however, that's simply not possible. you can't have a positive or negative mean amplitude, so that doesn't make sense. that's what I saw though. just now as I'm writing this, I've been looking into it and it seems that it's some sort of "whipping" action, like a whip or lassoe (zorro action). I'll have a better look soon when I "see" it clearly again.

OK, let's try. so under what conditions does it happen when the baseline changes (like DC biased AC), in that case it's still a vibration that just has a bias. it starts and ends on a higher value. so there has to be something that "locks in" a new energetic environment. the only thing that I know which does that is consciousness.

wow so, what locks in the beginning and end points? the alpha and omega, of course. that must be the function of consciousness on energetic spheres such as atoms (and other such things such as planets). it's the alpha and omega that pegs the starting point of the exchange that day.

I'm getting too abstract. I have to go. everything is fine. I did (sometime lately) figure out how to produce precise static charges without needing tesla technology, and the answer was the mechanical oscillator, but I don't know it yet so far to explain the idea (it's still far too distant and cloudy (cause I need to understand prerequisite concepts) to understand).

peace



well, it seems
