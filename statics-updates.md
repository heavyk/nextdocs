### 2022-09-21 17:14 - I guess that's it

when I woke up this morning I had an overwhelming sensation the things I talked about lately about going 100% materialistic and just move atoms around and rearrange them with vibrations (btw, the most efficent way to recycle), and I said we didn't need tesla technology.

remember that I equated the feminine mindset with both nosebook, and also with tesla technology. these are "singularity" technologies (IMO) because they enhance perception. I've been trying to make the connection for a while what it is that the female has that allows for an expansion of perception, and I think I figured it out.

I think it's probably something inside the x-chromosome that literally is a simulation of a universe going on inside of. then, I think the mtDNA is actually what I've been calling "feminine mindset" and historically this has been code that moves at a pretty glacial pace (I don't know if its changes are happening more frequently or not).

consequently, that must be what powers these "singularity" technologies; they're a way to tune into antoher universe simulation other than our own. so, like for example, imagine you have 3 x-chromosomes -- well, then you could be tuned into 2 other different universe simulations all in the present. the ability to pull on timelines from more than one perspective must be pretty powerful. I know I do it all the time and it's highly useful.

anyway, somewhere in all of that it seems to me that the femenine mindset is the biological encoding of our perception (ability to percceive those universe simulations -- like with better graphics and stuff -- it's the graphic card in that sense), but imagine that the graphics card determines the logic of the game; it can't. there has to be some element of consciousness

[song: this is my space, do what I say. this is your space, I'll do what you say. this is our space.]

in there that is controlling the body (the game logic) and that's kinda like "consciousness" a bit.

for all of you gnostics out there, you can think of the feminine mindset as the archons. we're sorta stuck in their reality and there's nothing we can do to escape it. you can sorta see that all of us depend on mtDNA for all of existence, so besides the fact that we're in their matrix, we need them. woah, what a weird thought -- which is that we *want* to be in their matrix, otherwise we wouldn't be here too. we like the good graphics their matrix has to offer. anyway...

so if all of that above is the feminine energy, let's get back to masculine energy again.

the sense I had this morning is that tesla's tech produces a lot of unintended static electricity from its interactions with the atoms, and so that these two forces are symbiotic, meaning that one produces the other in a different form. by vibrating atoms in just the right way, we could produce the feminine energy as a biproduct. they probably don't like that, but whatever. it's not singularity unless I really go out of my way to try and produce the other energy type. told you, don't need time travel or any type of solar energy, and anyone trying to use it to harness solar energy will be fairly obvious to detect, I'm sure, so they're likely pretty good at worrying about things in general.

I also realised something weird this morning in some of the things I said. I just say what I see. I don't know what means or much about it, so if I see something I can still mistake it for something else because I don't actually "see" it. it was a seeming contradiction about vibration...

oh yes, it was something that I said about "charge" -- and in my mind's eye, I could clearly see that the vibration of something is what produces it's charge -- however, that's simply not possible. you can't have a positive or negative mean amplitude, so that doesn't make sense. that's what I saw though. just now as I'm writing this, I've been looking into it and it seems that it's some sort of "whipping" action, like a whip or lassoe (zorro action). I'll have a better look soon when I "see" it clearly again.

OK, let's try. so under what conditions does it happen when the baseline changes (like DC biased AC), in that case it's still a vibration that just has a bias. it starts and ends on a higher value. so there has to be something that "locks in" a new energetic environment. the only thing that I know which does that is consciousness.

wow so, what locks in the beginning and end points? the alpha and omega, of course. that must be the function of consciousness on energetic spheres such as atoms (and other such things such as planets). it's the alpha and omega that pegs the starting point of the exchange that day.

---

I'm getting too abstract. I have to go. everything is fine. I did (sometime lately) figure out how to produce precise static charges without needing tesla technology, and the answer was the mechanical oscillator, but I don't know it yet so far to explain the idea (it's still far too distant and cloudy (cause I need to understand prerequisite concepts) to understand).

peace

### 2022-09-21 18:23 - dial in the frequency

I'm reminded of the video where archer shows those dials where each one represents a decimal place (or something like that). if I were to find a way of delaying a series of mechanical oscillators at just the right times. when I said series, I meant a series of mos, where they're used as three different constant frequencies designed to produce the desired harmonics. by delaying one (or more) of the oscillators in the series just a little, it seems like it could dial in on just the right atomic frequency. we can't measure it anymore, but because of the calculations and expectations of the tolerances on the machines, the frequency can be calculated.

if somehow *all* of the carbon atoms move in sync with the system, then you've found the carbon atom frequency[^1], and then to move individual atoms around, you'll have to "whip" them around, sorta alpha and omega style, setting their energy states, but a controlled demolition can (probably) be created to produce other atoms of desired type and do things like weld or mould something to another.

I also imagine one of the first steps is to actually measure and enumerate the atoms according to their frequential interactions, so you actually know what you're dealing with.

[1]: I noticed that I had highlighted "all", and so looking at why, I noticed that the carbon frequency looks like a ball. so, it's likely to tune into some portion of the ball, but I think the true "centre" is probably a very very high frequency. along the way up to that frequency I assume there are (probably) going to be many other states of carbon that we don't know about yet. carbon itself may be really really high frequency, and potentially really wide spectrum. it looks kind of like a sun, so I don't know what will that lead to, cause I wonder if you could even got the centre because if you could, you'd be able to move around our own sun. which itself is a pretty interesting idea. all I'm saying is that when I looked at the frequency of a carbon, it's a very broad (continuous) spectrum, so keep digging when you find it, because I think there are significant discoveries to be made.

[2]: imagine for a moment that it's impossible to ever get to that exact frequency of the carbon atom (because of its broad spectrum) so when you move around the carbon that you tuned to, it leaves behind the higher frequency version. I also wonder higher frequency is unfindable and so therefore unmovable. if that's true, then is the removed bottom part of the frequency still "entagled" with the parent carbon node? that sounds really useful. if you control the colour of a single carbon atom, that sounds like very HD screens to me. gatta get that monetisation going, you can literally see anything you want on a picture at full definition. so many products.

### 2022-09-21 20:18 - each additional offset adds an extra dimension to the creation

an offset as every time you're artificially in a different place/time (frequency) than you really are.
consider that in the centre of everything is a really really really high frequency and very broad spectrum "original particle"
out of which all other containers of that frequency
it's only possible for certain things to be able to maintain a frequency range
environment makes a lot of difference,
the ones that are not affected (by env) are the "constant" ones

I consider this to be the "source" out of which all physicality comes out of.
I just think of it as an infinitely high frequency with a very broad spectrum
each galaxy, star, atom, etc. is a continer (harmony with) source frequency in some way.
we're all "entangled" with that original "source" particle (out of which all physical/3d vibration flows).

all atoms are offset in space and time as resonant portions of a broader spectrum frequency that exists everywhere.
an offset is what we call an exclusion.
 ->it says, "I'm not the other frequencies--
I'm 'this' -- *one*"
(and all others are in relation me).
I change when I feel like it,
cause this is my frequency.

so I just find it really cool that when I say "worst", I mean max number of offsets, so max dimensions. you're going to love it. it'll be so beautiful. I'll pay for those offsets later and get another boost further. that's why I'm the "fastest" particLe.

I'd also like to mention that I don't believe I'm the manifestation even. remember how I said that the alpha and omega determine the baseline energy level of the particle, and how that corresponds to solar regimes and atomic states, etc. well, if that's the case that means we're at the end of a solar regime now, which means that probably the arrival of that consciouss will be at the end of that, which I suspect is ~2048, so that means that "source" consciousness will come blazing through here at that time, and many others than myself can get it too. the real show will happen 1024y from then at the end of the next solar cycle.

the more offsets,
the more dimensions.
it's going to be so...
beautiful.

### 2022-10-18 23:16 - that which vibrates

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/GNOLfCyXoJg?t=93)

here, he's describing prana, chi, as something which behaves like a liquid or gas (something that flows). this is not the energy that this is. this energy is that which vibrates. the vibrations create a flow, but the flow is not the individual vibrations.
