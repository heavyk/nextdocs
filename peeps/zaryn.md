### 2022-11-11 20:20 - easier in a foreign language

did you notice that it's a lot easier to express yourself in another language? I notice that in english it would sound really weird for me to write something inspirational to a person, but in another language, for example spanish, I find it a lot easier to express myself now. like, it feels like I can just write exactly what I want to say.

lately I've been fascinated by some japanese metal artists. they have a totally different way of expressing the american magnitude measuring contest. what do you think about this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp3t5qBwLIc

after watching that video it's plagued me how differently they see the same things that I see without physical representation. it's hard to describe, but anyway I was thinking that if I knew japanese, I wonder how I would eventually learn to express myself.

one of the things that I find so difficult is the visual aspect to their language. it's like this parabolic screen that I'm using -- there's more visual data there but I can't see it, so instead I *feel* it. the concepts sometimes are so jumbled because they've been jumbled together when they were assembled by the directors, so for me these turn into pretty funny concepts. their language, from a non-visual standpoint is absolutely hilarious, and super interesting because they have things that we don't have in english.

one day I want to design my own language. one of the things tmat I've long yearned for in my native language is the ability to express statements with a range of probabilities, ranging from maximally probable to extremely unlikely. this is a super big trap for a person like myself.

let me tell you about myself. I don't gamble really. I wont do anything that I feel to be unsafe or risky. I'm a very safe person, but safe by *my* standards, not seme idea a bs commitee that pulled something out of their ass through their perspective of fear. I consider and treat anything below 10% likelihood to be impossible, which meeans that gambling dosen't make sense for me. I prefer to live the safe life where "lucky" is associated with impossible. I only do the things I'm sure I can accomplish.

therefore, a language where a person can communicate a probability other than my own, I might fall victim to believing others' probabilities, rathar than my own; and, because of law of attraction, I'll accomplish what they believe is possible -- though, I won't  then have a concept myself of what is possible.

see the trap I'm laying for myself? I'm sneaky like that. I'm my own worst enemy.

### 2022-11-13 12:20 - what is safe?

I noticed that you (or someone that read the email, but it felt like you) had some disagreement with my analysis that I *only* do the things that I feel safe doing...

remember when you and raquel were trying to convince me that xagly and friends were a real problem. this is a perfect example of something you (and raquel) perceived as me doing something unsafe, but I didn't have any feelings of safety about it. I felt like it was fine and that it will work out. I felt the same way about tuenti even though I didn't 100% have the full picture in my head about how I was going to do it. I felt good about it. I didn't feel any risk involved about going to spain and doing that.

likewise, I didn't feel any risk about xagly and friends either. it felt like it was going to work out, so I went with it. after a number of conversations that I had with you and others about the thing, I decided I could trust you or raquel instead of my own feeling on the matter. I choose to trust myself over other people (I'm kinda egotistical), so I always default to trusting myself over other people.

now, let's talk about the incident in vallecas. that was not something that I felt fine about. I was uneasy the whole time and it was really not at all something that I wanted to be doing (this is a big departure from the way I felt about xagly and friends). in that incident, if I had've trusted myself, I *would* have been fine. I wouldn't have gone because that idea felt really bad to me.

however, even though undesirable things happened, I *still* felt like I was going to come out of it OK. weird, huh. OK, now you know the "police" (or whatever they called theirselves) up in mondragon? this is another one of those weird incidents, where giving him the money didn't really bother me. it even felt like the right thing to do. that's partially why I was so confused when you called because I felt like I was doing the right thing. sure there were a lot of other feelings too which are too difficult to analyse in such a "short" email, the main thing to say is that I *felt* like it was the thing I wanted to do.

then, you know when I went back to mondragon with the special investigations unit and I was supposed to identify the guy? again, it was this wierd thing where he looked familar to me, but because so many people look familiar to me, I didn't want to make another mistake on a person's face I didn't recognise. it felt to me like it was him, but I couldn't bring myself to positively identify him. I just didn't feel sure about it, though looking back at it, cLearly it *was* him. he even moved like the guy did (the nose wiping and everything), so again, I found myself in a situation where some element of me had some awareness of reality, but my emotional self was not wanting to try and positively identify him for some reason. I just felt it would be OK. and, it was.

I follow my feelings primarily because I've found out that I can always trust them, even if they don't make sense in a physical sense. I don't have the time here to try and relate the countless events that have happened in my past that I did (like going to the party where I met you and brent; I just felt like going). I follow my instinct, as it has never failed me. often times I have to get through a rough patch to get to better conditions, but in the end, all things we do (even the aquisition of conditions), is so that we can *feel* something. I'm not going to preach, but following my instinct, is *always* going to be safer than following someone else's guidance.

there is a part of you, me, and everyone that always has our utmost well-being in mind, and if you will learn to trust yourself over others and conditions, you'll always come out fine. you may notice this aspect of my personality as something that you'd probably label "delusion of invincibility"

anyway, cheers dude. it'd be great to hear from you again. I have a few more multimillion (billion?) dollar ideas on the back burner again if you're interested, btw
