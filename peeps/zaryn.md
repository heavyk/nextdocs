### 2022-11-11 20:20 - easier in a foreign language

did you notice that it's a lot easier to express yourself in another language? I notice that in english it would sound really weird for me to write something inspirational to a person, but in another language, for example spanish, I find it a lot easier to express myself now. like, it feels like I can just write exactly what I want to say.

lately I've been fascinated by some japanese metal artists. they have a totally different way of expressing the american magnitude measuring contest. what do you think about this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp3t5qBwLIc

after watching that video it's plagued me how differently they see the same things that I see without physical representation. it's hard to describe, but anyway I was thinking that if I knew japanese, I wonder how I would eventually learn to express myself.

one of the things that I find so difficult is the visual aspect to their language. it's like this parabolic screen that I'm using -- there's more visual data there but I can't see it, so instead I *feel* it. the concepts sometimes are so jumbled because they've been jumbled together when they were assembled by the directors, so for me these turn into pretty funny concepts. their language, from a non-visual standpoint is absolutely hilarious, and super interesting because they have things that we don't have in english.

one day I want to design my own language. one of the things tmat I've long yearned for in my native language is the ability to express statements with a range of probabilities, ranging from maximally probable to extremely unlikely. this is a super big trap for a person like myself.

let me tell you about myself. I don't gamble really. I wont do anything that I feel to be unsafe or risky. I'm a very safe person, but safe by *my* standards, not seme idea a bs commitee that pulled something out of their ass through their perspective of fear. I consider and treat anything below 10% likelihood to be impossible, which meeans that gambling dosen't make sense for me. I prefer to live the safe life where "lucky" is associated with impossible. I only do the things I'm sure I can accomplish.

therefore, a language where a person can communicate a probability other than my own, I might fall victim to believing others' probabilities, rathar than my own; and, because of law of attraction, I'll accomplish what they believe is possible -- though, I won't  then have a concept myself of what is possible.

see the trap I'm laying for myself? I'm sneaky like that. I'm my own worst enemy.
