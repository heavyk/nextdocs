### 2022-11-13 14:28 - small subtext on "it's totally fine wherever you are"

there is a subtext in what I wrote earlier (don't remember where or when) when I was talking about "we is where we is" in that if we want to take on the promethian mindset, we sort of become a new race or species in that all of us all have low resistance to each other, and for us it's comfortable to be around others like ourselves (like most animal species are OK with others of their own kind, and often times many more).

if such a thing were to happen, and I can tell you that it already is, in the worst case, we'll find that the majority of the population is not conceptually capable of such a mental jump. that's perfectly fine, and that's the thing. we is where we is. we have to find a pathway and make it as easy as possible to get on board.

one of the central points that I like to make is that since the 9/11 buildings went down, it ended the economic power (saloman brothers). and now, because the whole thing is a farse, now the media has complete control over what is perceived. this means (roughly speaking), that power has moved over to the marketing team. it appers (but it's an illusion) that the media (social and otherwise) has control over our ideology and behavioural syntax, but in reality, that control is completely in the hands of the fashion, tech industry, etc. the way that these marketing teams present the human in their ideal form creates the ideal form and also the "opposite" form perceived by those not-good-enough.

therefore, considering now that power has completely shifted over to the sales and marketing teams worldwide, we now recognise that it is not the thing, but the perception of the thing which sells the thing. this means that success or enslavement of those who have not entirely made it up to speed yet, is entirely in the hands of the marketing team.

pretty cool, huh.
