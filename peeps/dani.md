hey dude,

my brother had a pretty good idea this afternoon about an app or something that takes in directions on to your phone (or pc) which then takes events and routes them through some logic to make a sound.

so imagine you have the gps api and you're getting directions to a place from the api and it's telling you to turn right based on your position, imagine you missed it for one street it could route to a sound that says, "opps, take the next right" or any other type of thing. computer voices could be used like that really funny one on twitch chat lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

anyway, the idea is to start with a gps app, and greg suggested that we integrate this immediately with tesla power chargers to get a bunch of users. I told him that's all the marketing department. I'm just talking about the product. he said he didn't know much about implementation. I told him I would send you this email..

stay strong,
kenny
