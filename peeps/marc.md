### 2022-11-11 21:43 - I play life like maru

I noticed yesteday in your pov analysis of maru that I play life like maru does. when you play, I notice that you don't put down the sensor tower until really late, yet you say it's really important, for you it's late. same with the turrets. you tend to put them most commonly in reaction to something, but it looks like maru actually slows his economy (later expansion) in order to afford the turrets and sensors.

the way that I perceive this approach to life is the super safe one. I will *only* do things that I feel safe doing. so when you watch maru, when he attacks, he feels safe attacking, which is why the fights often turn out so well for him. the way that I do that is to *only* do the thing that makes me feel safe. one less thing to worry about is extra mental capacity for receiving good ideas and intuitions.

in addition to that, I consider all things of 10% or less to be impossible. this means that will seldom have the idea that I'm somehow more "lucky" because I consider all of the "lucky stuff" to be impossible. I take full responsibity for everything that's happening in my reality. I'm a real centre of the universe type and I feel that *all* things are a reaction to me and my presence. I'm really egotistical, but it's hidden really well behind the safety aspect.

this grants one unbelievable advantage that doesn't really appear to be much, but in reality "es la puta leche" because I get to be the same person to all people. any changes in my composure is a reaction to how I feel (which is usually in response to my env/people). also, all behaviour is reactionary so what ends up happening is I'm ultra stable. from the perspective of those around me, seemingly fixed at the centre -- the equator where force is neither up or down.

now, the way that I will decode for you this is, that you play like an emitter, which is amplitude of vibration, like the emanation of light, but maru plays like a "ground" where everything is safe and all effects are minimised to the point where it's just a methodical process of expansion.

---

now, I'd like to talk a bit about the ground from my perspective. though I noticed that maru has a perspective similar to my own (which is that I see things from the zero perspective), which is a whole philosophical discussion on its own -- probably does not guarantee that maru sees anything this way. this is my perspective. we can gain new dimensions by understanding the perspective of others, which I know you also know and have experienced (though it's really weird that word "experiencied" looks *wrong* to me, I'm certain that I'm right). you don't know what you're looking for yet. it's always the thing that you'd always looked at but never noticed it was there quite like that.

I perceive this concept from a diffreent perspective in that I see constant improvements to *my* perspective and how I see things, that it's completely irrelevant to me what anyone else sees. what's important to me is that instead I *understand* their conceptuaal perspective of reality. you know we have tons of different perspectives on reality (most easily observed culturally) and each of those different perspectives is a valid perception of these things. everyone perceives in reflecttion of their concept of reality. I don't care of others' views anymore. my perspective is dominant.

---

another way to look at this is in the form of a reflection. you know that light has an absorbative and an emissive property to it. a perfect reflector means that its vibration was completely unchanged by the impacting vibration; it's completely solid, unmovable.

if I absorb a vibration, if I'm a perfect reflector, I'm a perfect ground. I just reflect the vibration back as unchanged as possible. this is very similar to the role of a female that receives and transmits her energy type, a ground tries not to modify the signal, so the female receives her own concepts back to her unchanged. it's really weird how I've never seen a single one of them have introspection to have noticed that they don't reflect, but receive modify and retransmit -- a very different process.

so because I've noticed girls to so often look only at the modification that they want to see (the reencoding), they totally miss out on letting the poor guy discover his own concept sucks, for himself. I do it too because I have a very active feminine side, and since so many people have such a low opinion of theirselves (not-good-enoughness), this creates a bunch of people looking for acceptance.

the problem with this desire for acceptance is that very commonly we hang our acceptance or our machoness, manliness, or toughness on the belief of other people -- meaning, that as long as those people accept me, think I'm tough, macho, manly, etc. then I am; however, if they go away, I lose that identity of myself. I now depend on people. I am no longer an individual. personally I refrain from that style of self-identification. I accept nothing less for myself than pure desire. no need for acceptance or any of these other tokens of identity.
