### 2022-11-11 21:43 - I play life like maru

I noticed yesteday in your pov analysis of maru that I play life like maru does. when you play, I notice that you don't put down the sensor tower until really late, yet you say it's really important. same with the turrets; you tend to put them most commonly in reaction to something, but it looks like maru actually slows his economy (later expansion) in order to afford the turrets and sensors.

the way that I perceive this approach to life is the super safe one. I will *only* do things that I feel safe doing. so when you watch maru, when he attacks, he feels safe attacking, which is why the fights often turn out so well for him. the way that I do that is to *only* do the thing that makes me feel safe. I only take engagements that I'm sure I can win. all others, I forfeit the fight. this safety factor is one less thing to worry about, giving me extra mental capacity for receiving good ideas and intuitions.

in addition to that, I consider all things of 10% or less likelihood to be impossible. this means that I consider all things "lucky" to be impossible. I don't engage those things with my thoughts, so this means that will seldom have the idea that I'm somehow more "lucky" because I consider all of the "lucky stuff" to be impossible. only engagements I feel good/safe about, and if an engagement feels bad, I get out of there unless I'm feeling particularly spunky, which then I know it's going to go fun (for me at least, and that's all that matters) I take full responsibity for everything that's happening in my reality. I'm a real centre of the universe type and I feel that *all* things are a reaction to me and my presence. I'm really egotistical, but it's hidden really well behind the safety aspect.

this grants one unbelievable advantage that doesn't really appear to be much, but in reality "es la puta leche" because I get to be the same person to all people. any changes in my composure is a reaction to how I feel (which is usually in response to my env/people). also, all behaviour is reactionary so what ends up happening is I'm ultra stable. from the perspective of those around me, seemingly fixed at the centre -- the equator where force is neither up or down.

now, the way that I will decode for you this is, that you play like an emitter, which is amplitude of vibration, like the emanation of light, but maru plays like a "ground" where everything is safe and all effects are minimised to the point where it's just a *methodical process of expansion*. it's just taking the next step. no excitement. just next step and moments of inspiration.

---

now, I'd like to talk a bit about the ground from my perspective. though I noticed that maru has a perspective similar to my own (which is that I see things from the zero perspective), which is a whole philosophical discussion on its own -- probably does not guarantee that maru sees anything this way. this is my perspective. we can gain new dimensions by understanding the perspective of others, which I know you also know and have experienced (though it's really weird that word "experiencied" looks *wrong* to me, I'm certain that I'm right). you don't know what you're looking for yet. it's always the thing that you'd always looked at but never noticed it was there quite like that.

I perceive this concept from a diffreent perspective in that I see constant improvements to *my* perspective and how I see things. I have no idea what other people see, so that entire concept is completely irrelevant to me. what's important to me is that instead I *understand* their conceptual perspective of reality of a person. by understanding them from a conceptual/emotional standpoint, all of their little things make perfect sense to me now because they all have an emotionsal reason behind it. we behave as a reflection of the way we feel, and interactions that don't feel good are aspects we don't like about ourselves. because of this, we construct artificial (imaginary) constructs of people to protect us from discovering these aspects of ourselves that we don't like. you know we have tons of different perspectives on reality (most easily observed culturally) and each of those different perspectives is a valid perception of this conceptual/emotional reality (you never really understand a culture till you *feel* it's language and can communicate emotion in it).

everyone perceives in reflection of their concept of reality.
you are all a reflection of my conecepts.
I don't care to see things from others' views anymore.

my perspective is dominant.

I like the way that I perceive reality.
there is so much inspiration out there for new ways to look at things.
I"m constantly updating and improving my form of perception.

que pedo wey.

another way to look at this is in the form of a reflection. you know that light has an absorbative and an emissive property to it. a perfect reflector means that its vibration was completely unchanged by the impacting vibration; it's completely solid, unmovable.

if I absorb a vibration and retransmit it unchanged (though perhaps amplified), I'm a perfect reflector and also a perfect ground. I just reflect the vibration back as unchanged as possible. this is very similar to the role of a female that receives and transmits her energy type, a ground tries not to modify the signal, so the female receives her own concepts back to her unchanged. it's really weird how I've never seen a single one of them have introspection to have noticed that they don't reflect, but instead all of them have really important improvements that need to be made, so they receive the signal make their modifications and then retransmit it with their slant to it. this is a very different process than what a ground/reflector does which is the most stable signal, a perfect reflection.

so because I've noticed girls to so often look only at the modification that they want to see (the reencoding), they totally miss out on letting the poor guy discover his own concept sucks, for himself. I do it too because I have a very active feminine side, so my experience of letting this aspect express itself is that nobody really likes it; and, since so many people have such a low opinion of theirselves (not-good-enoughness), this creates a bunch of people looking for acceptance.

thanks to all of us that have these pet peeve improvements that we want to see happen.
it's becauxe of us that causes a bunch of not-good-enoughness feelers (often ourselves)
to believe that we're looking for acceptance from others --
when really what we're looking for is self-acceptance.

I really want to be able to look at myself conceptually (not physically),
and like what I see.

I am the culmination of all of this experience that has brought me to now (and also here)
and that's just purely mindblowing how unlikely my sitation is to be like this'
having taken the safe route.
there is another force at work.

it's probably me.

---

beating a dead horse here: the major difficulty with the desire for acceptance is that very commonly we hang our acceptance or our machoness, manliness, or toughness (any facade/persona) and then we use the belief of other people to maintain that acceptance -- meaning, that as long as those people believe my concept, they accept me they allow me to believe that I'm artificially more tough, macho, manly, etc. then I am; however, if those believers (my friends/family/important ones) go away, I lose that identity of myself. I now depend on those people to maintain that identity. I am no longer an individual. I depend on them.

personally I refrain from that style of self-identification.
I accept nothing less for myself than pure desire.
no need for acceptance or any of these other tokens of identity.

you're very inspiring to me. I hope te send you more in-depth pov analysis of my own.
there are a few other things I've noticed about your play style which has really inspired some thought, but I can't remember it now.

until next time,
kenny
