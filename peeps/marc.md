### 2022-11-11 21:43 - I play life like maru

I noticed yesteday in your pov analysis of maru that I play life like maru does. when you play, I notice that you don't put down the sensor tower until really late, yet you say it's really important. same with the turrets; you tend to put them most commonly in reaction to something, but it looks like maru actually slows his economy (later expansion) in order to afford the turrets and sensors.

the way that I perceive this approach to life is the super safe one. I will *only* do things that I feel safe doing. so when you watch maru, when he attacks, he feels safe attacking, which is why the fights often turn out so well for him. the way that I do that is to *only* do the thing that makes me feel safe. I only take engagements that I'm sure I can win. all others, I forfeit the fight. this safety factor is one less thing to worry about, giving me extra mental capacity for receiving good ideas and intuitions.

in addition to that, I consider all things of 10% or less likelihood to be impossible. this means that I consider all things "lucky" to be impossible. I don't engage those things with my thoughts, so this means that will seldom have the idea that I'm somehow more "lucky" because I consider all of the "lucky stuff" to be impossible. only engagements I feel good/safe about, and if an engagement feels bad, I get out of there unless I'm feeling particularly spunky, which then I know it's going to go fun (for me at least, and that's all that matters) I take full responsibity for everything that's happening in my reality. I'm a real centre of the universe type and I feel that *all* things are a reaction to me and my presence. I'm really egotistical, but it's hidden really well behind the safety aspect.

this grants one unbelievable advantage that doesn't really appear to be much, but in reality "es la puta leche" because I get to be the same person to all people. any changes in my composure is a reaction to how I feel (which is usually in response to my env/people). also, all behaviour is reactionary so what ends up happening is I'm ultra stable. from the perspective of those around me, seemingly fixed at the centre -- the equator where force is neither up or down.

now, the way that I will decode for you this is, that you play like an emitter, which is amplitude of vibration, like the emanation of light, but maru plays like a "ground" where everything is safe and all effects are minimised to the point where it's just a *methodical process of expansion*. it's just taking the next step. no excitement. just next step and moments of inspiration.

---

now, I'd like to talk a bit about the ground from my perspective. though I noticed that maru has a perspective similar to my own (which is that I see things from the zero perspective), which is a whole philosophical discussion on its own -- probably does not guarantee that maru sees anything this way. this is my perspective. we can gain new dimensions by understanding the perspective of others, which I know you also know and have experienced (though it's really weird that word "experiencied" looks *wrong* to me, I'm certain that I'm right). you don't know what you're looking for yet. it's always the thing that you'd always looked at but never noticed it was there quite like that.

I perceive this concept from a diffreent perspective in that I see constant improvements to *my* perspective and how I see things. I have no idea what other people see, so that entire concept is completely irrelevant to me. what's important to me is that instead I *understand* their conceptual perspective of reality of a person. by understanding them from a conceptual/emotional standpoint, all of their little things make perfect sense to me now because they all have an emotionsal reason behind it. we behave as a reflection of the way we feel, and interactions that don't feel good are aspects we don't like about ourselves. because of this, we construct artificial (imaginary) constructs of people to protect us from discovering these aspects of ourselves that we don't like. you know we have tons of different perspectives on reality (most easily observed culturally) and each of those different perspectives is a valid perception of this conceptual/emotional reality (you never really understand a culture till you *feel* it's language and can communicate emotion in it).

everyone perceives in reflection of their concept of reality.
you are all a reflection of my conecepts.
I don't care to see things from others' views anymore.

my perspective is dominant.

I like the way that I perceive reality.
there is so much inspiration out there for new ways to look at things.
I"m constantly updating and improving my form of perception.

que pedo wey.

another way to look at this is in the form of a reflection. you know that light has an absorbative and an emissive property to it. a perfect reflector means that its vibration was completely unchanged by the impacting vibration; it's completely solid, unmovable.

if I absorb a vibration and retransmit it unchanged (though perhaps amplified), I'm a perfect reflector and also a perfect ground. I just reflect the vibration back as unchanged as possible. this is very similar to the role of a female that receives and transmits her energy type, a ground tries not to modify the signal, so the female receives her own concepts back to her unchanged. it's really weird how I've never seen a single one of them have introspection to have noticed that they don't reflect, but instead all of them have really important improvements that need to be made, so they receive the signal make their modifications and then retransmit it with their slant to it. this is a very different process than what a ground/reflector does which is the most stable signal, a perfect reflection.

so because I've noticed girls to so often look only at the modification that they want to see (the reencoding), they totally miss out on letting the poor guy discover his own concept sucks, for himself. I do it too because I have a very active feminine side, so my experience of letting this aspect express itself is that nobody really likes it; and, since so many people have such a low opinion of theirselves (not-good-enoughness), this creates a bunch of people looking for acceptance.

thanks to all of us that have these pet peeve improvements that we need/want/IAM to see happen...
we cause a bunch of not-good-enoughness feelers (often ourselves)
to end up believing that that we're looking for acceptance from others --
when really what we're looking for is self-acceptance.

I really want to be able to look at myself conceptually
(not physically),
and like what I see.

I am the culmination of all of my experience that has brought me to now (and also here)
and it's just mindblowing how unlikely my sitation is to be like this,
having had taken the safe route.
there is another force at work.

it's probably me.

---

beating a dead horse here: the major difficulty with the desire for acceptance is that very commonly we hang our acceptance or our machoness, manliness, or toughness (any facade/persona) and then we use the belief of other people to maintain that acceptance -- meaning, that as long as those people believe my concept, they accept me they allow me to believe that I'm artificially more tough, macho, manly, etc. then I am; however, if those believers (my friends/family/important ones) go away, I lose that identity of myself. I now depend on those people to maintain that identity. I am no longer an individual. I depend on them.

personally I refrain from that style of self-identification.
I accept nothing less for myself than pure desire.
no need for acceptance or any of these other tokens of identity.

you're very inspiring to me. I hope te send you more in-depth pov analysis of my own.
there are a few other things I've noticed about your play style which has really inspired some thought, but I can't remember it now.

until next time,
kenny

no, I don't play SC2. my experience with the game is that one day youtube suggested a video of scarlett doing something amazing. I watched it and was quite impressed. I wanted to see what it looked like from the POV of the person playing the game (like you), but my search skillz weren't expert and all I found were casters talkning about the game, not the person playing the game.

one day I was kinda sick of hearthstone so I installed SC2 and decided to play the campaign. I hated how much micromanagement there is, when if I could just hook actions up to a spreadsheet, like when this much minerals and this much gas and in this phase/state then do this thing (build a scv for example). I shouldn't need to worry about all of these things because that's why computers were made in the first place; to eliminiate the tediousness of life. or, at least that's what I was brought up to believe, anyway.

I promptly uninstalled the game and never returned to think about it. then youtube suggested me your video of defeating 1v7 insane AI against zerg. I was very impressed so I started watching your videos. all knowledge of the game that I have is from watching you play. I'm pretty good at figuring stuff out, so it was pretty effortless to understand the game. I understand concepts of the game probably better than many, even though I've "never" played the game.

---

it's unlikely that I'll play it to any significant amount. if I do I believe that I'll wait until I have a different keyboard than the one I have now. I know, lol such a major excuse for the armchair players out there ("I'd totally have made that touchdown if I were out there"), I'm not even trying to add it in.

anyway, the major reason for not wanting to play and prefer to only observe is that I had a brain haemorrhage that had happened in my right hemisphere. it, along with my imagination, has been completely shut down. I literally have no concept of where my hand is in space. without this awareness (I rememmber because I had it before the brain thing, my fingers could dance to my desire and I was very fast reactions like you), but at the moment, I'm not too sure what key I'm pressing because I don't really feel my fingers. it feels like a constant stressful sensation.

when I relax, often times I experience extreme expansions of my visual capacity. when I go to sleep, the safety police over at the network ensure that I never am able to feel so relaxed again. my life is a steady stream of learning to feel relaxed even though my physical body does not feel relaxed at all. it's quite the thing and has inverted a person like you to become more like me.

I used to be a lot like you.
I recognise myself a lot in you.
we took different paths though.
I used to have such a problem with anger
and emotion that I shut it down.

it felt unpredictable and like something that I could not control.
I decided that all things can be determined or predicted as long
as enough information could be known, an optimal route can be selected.

I was very nieve as a child and hadn't arrived to the "real world" yet.
this is where there are lots of people out there that want to try
and take advantage of a bright person like myself.

I'm magnetic.
I glow and people can see my radiance.
easy target for the sharks.
I'm like juicy shark bait to the ambitious types.

it's often the case that the ones that want to take advantage of a person like me (they're my employers) are not people thinking of open exchange of information, and so therefore they're not at all looking for an optimal route. so much for my pet desire to optimise everyting and remove as many aspects of waste as possible. everything needs a function to exist in my universe.

I'll tell you a secret and the conclusion to that logical dilema, which is that in the end, things do not in fact need to have a reason. things happen because of feeling, not because of reason -- though, you'll always be able to logically (mansplain) something away: "it did appear after all, so we can't ignore the reality of it. here's my theory of how it got here and/or how I'm going to react to it."

this brings in the implication that reality is composed of a feeling/conceptual landscape rathar than just a physical environment. now reality has a direction, a narrative structure, a goal. everyone feels they're going somewhere, even the most stuck people, and ultimately it's how I feel about where I'm going (my attitude) that makes all of the difference.

I'm going to end it here.

until next time,
kenny

P.S. assimilate. assimilate.

### 2022-11-12 00:03 - what I would like to play

I should have been more explicit: it's unilikely I'll ever play SC2. instead of trying to conform to a RTS experience, I would rather to create my own. I have a lot of ideas on how I would do it, so instead of spending my time to get good at a game, I would make the RTS that I would feel comfortable playing (with my left-side disability). sure everyone else will be twice as good as me, but it'll be fun for me to play (and probably a lot others as well).

I prefer to hold out for what I want rathar than coform to someone else's perception of the concept. only I can see the idea clearly in a way that I would desire it to be. obviously. only I can make/attract that concept rendered into reality as desirable as I want it to be, cause nobody else sees it like I do. I'm obviously the best guy to implement my desire.
