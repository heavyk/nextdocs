### 2022-11-22 16:27 - my theory on what happened today

today, I "attacked" jerrica's phone ... I felt very strongly that I had to destroy it. however, there were a lot of things leading up to that.

it starts with this morning when I started to get a number of reactions... I describe them in this way...

#### 2022-11-22 13:10 - which way am I going to go?

I was just sitting out in the sun, and I was reminded of a lot of different reactions that I often felt last night when going to the bathroom (I don't feel reactions so much when I play games, which is why I like to "disconnect" from all of the reactions for a bit).

the main reaction seems to be a discussion on what or who it is that I'll pick. to me, this is a really silly question to be asking, because I have no control over it.

it's all attraction, so from my perspective, I simply keep going until I go past the "point of no return" -- meaning, that from my perspective, the attraction is so strong, that there's no other way for me to go. I don't decide anything.

therefore, from my perspective, it looks like I simply keep going for as long as I can keep going, until of course I get connected (maxine-foot-dragon). from your perspective, it'll look like I'm constantly causing trouble and refusing, but it's not that I'm refusing ... it's just that I don't really feel good about the whole situation still.

---

sure, it's true that as time has progressed, I seem to feel less and less good about the situation -- and that's normal because the situation, from my physical perspective is that nosebook is trying to figure out how to orchestrate a situation that I don't want to be in -- so, it's normal that if they're going toward unwanted, I'll feel more and more resistance.

as an example, when I worked in tuenti (or when I was with raquel), I knew I had to walk away from the situation that I was in. sure, I really liked the idea of creating a social network, but the direction that things were going was (from my perspective) becoming less and less like something that I wanted to be a part of -- so, I walk away.

because it's all attraction, there is still a manifestation out there that feels equivalent to what I thought I would feel creating tuenti -- meaning, from my perspective, I feel destined to create something that I really like -- perhaps not a social network but something even better. that's the nice thing about letting the manifestation be "all attraction" because I don't have to do anything. I already had the desire, so now I just simply wait around for it to come.

I don't mean that I just sit on my hands. I follow my instinct -- so, for example the last few times I wanted to smoke, I felt strong inspiration to do so. I mean, like the last time, I was sitting out in the sun (like today) and it came to me so clearly, it might have even been audible (cause nosebook hears and sees things that I don't -- which is why I've gotten so good at listening to that "still small voice" even without the visible or audible manifestation). sure, it's possible to receive images and feelings from other people -- but that's the secret to getting good at hearing your inner instinct -- is that when starting out, that "instinct" sounded a lot like raquel or mom (feminine-mind) -- and so I had to actually start to pay attention to what is programmed instinct, and what is actually my "higher self".

I still get that voice mixed up sometimes, and often times in hindsight, I can see that it was actually nosebook (or someone else's attraction), but the thing is, when it feels fine (no matter the source), it always works out fine.

this is what I mean when I say it's all attraction. I imagine that one day, a person will become attractive enough that whatever it is that I feel from them is good enough for me to follow up with action myself.

a good example of this was the thing where when I smoked, it felt to me like a bunch of people were trying to get me to make a move -- so I did -- and it wasn't what people expected. obviously, if it was something that someone wanted, it would have got a reaction.

I try to stay reactionary, but eventually, when attraction is strong enough, I'll make an action because it's what "feels right" -- and so I regret nothing. I acted based on what I felt right.

"but nothing came of it, so it was a failure" -- I can hear the reactions already -- but please beware of the lust for results or the need for a manifestation in order to feel good.

it's quite possible that exactly *nothing* will come of any of the actions that I make for quite a while. like this last time, the actions are not for results, but for better positioning or preparation (depending on how you want to look at it).

I really wouldn't expect anything too substantial for quite a while. you all are still *very* incompatible with me in both, how we see the world, and how we interact with each other.

you all are still quite a bit stuck in your imaginations, trying so hard to plan everything out and get everything perfect and everything -- pretending to be prometheus with all of your forethought, but I'm the guy that's all about the afterthought -- epimetheus.

I have no forethought because you guys are all so busy doing that. when I try to make an action, sometimes I think to myself what will be the result, but mostly -- my perception is not about what will happen in some ficticious scenario -- instead, I react in the moment to things that are happening around me.

in that sense, I'm neither prometheus or epimetheus -- but a whole different style of thinking altogether, which is something like the reptile brain. I react to things based on the way I feel. if it feels good, I react well, but if it doesn't feel good, I run away or fight.

while I describe that "instinct" kind of like the reptile brain -- because it is that -- what you all are not 100% capable of doing is fully conceptualising the world the way that I do. this is painfully obvious to me because you still behave very strangely. just be yourself, and let me be myself too.

to explain this, consider the orange cat that walks around in our yard. there's this funny thing that I simply cannot be myself around her(?). she is constantly aware of everything I'm doing, and if I come out the garage like I normally do, she gets ultra scared and runs away. if I try to just walk past, there's this weird presence that's similar to what I felt when I was in spain when the guys were all super conscious of what I was doing and stuff, or like jaron oftet times when I walk up the stairs.

neither the cat, jaron, or the dudes in spain are carrying on as normal. they're all hyper aware of me and and waiting to react in any moment's notice based on whatever I do.

whenever a person is hyper aware of another person, they perceive them as a threat or a danger. there's an element of unknown or danger. that hyper-awareness, happens because they do not understand me, meaning that I'm still a perceived threat.

I had to learn how to understand people so that I could be around them without being hyper-aware of them, because when I was hyper-aware of them, my left-leg locked up and doesn't move fluidly. you can tell when you catch me off-guard or you have a presence about you that I don't understand, because I'll jump and get really startled.

good luck figuring that out. like I said, from my perspective, I don't want to do something until I actually feel comfortable with it, or [it feels effortless to me](/vapidshamen.md#2022-11-20-1705---i-want-to-write) (lol).

OK, now after writing that, I went out to put the plants in the rocks from the anthill. everything is going fine. there's no problem. while I'm out there, I'm thinking about what I wrote and listening to the reactions to it. I noticed that nosebook did some research into where those reactions were coming from (the ones I described as "a discussion on what or who it is that I'll pick"). I noticed that nosebook had a lot of mental energy going on around remi. I remembered that I saw sesily's car out in front of remi's house when I went upstairs to get the plants setup (right before I went to sit in the sun). I figure they were talking about things, and it was actually their discussion that I was feeling in the bathroom and out in the sun.

one of the things that, almost certainly came up in remi's and sesily's conversation was an inicident that happened when I went over to the garage sale at carefree #19. I saw remi there. she was talking with melissa (the woman that lives at #19), and they seemed suprised to see me. I could tell they were talking about me when I walked up, and they rapidly changed the subject to this one about a story about someone getting abducted.

very frustrated, I went on to explain to them that those news stories are fabricated -- and placed there on purpose. law enforcement knows exactly where everyone is in real-time and can get any information that they want about the person; nobody is lost, this I can assure you. I told them this and we got into a discussion about it. they held fast that such a technology does not exist and that there actually *are* people that law enforcement does not know where they are.

to cut a long story short, my theory (more than a theory) of what happened there is that melissa and remi were talking about me abducting their daughters (or somehow taking them away from them), and so when they changed subjects, they changed the topic, but the feeling vibration stayed the same, which was one of getting someone you love taken away from you.

I disagreed very strongly with remi on this one, and that was the last major conversation that I had with her (except for another one about drugs, mine and her husband's usage of them (cause it's fine)). this was the "end" of my "close" relationship with remi, and when her mom sesily stepped in. nothing major happened with sesily, so she probably sees me as fine, meanwhile remi probably sees my hard stance on these news stories about abductions (and today's topic of shootings) to be fake. everything is 100% controlled, so you only see what they want you to see, and most of it is all pure drama.

---

skip forward to jerrica now and it was positively mind boggling to me how badly she wanted me to see this news story. she really wanted me to know that she knows someone that died in the shooting.

you have to understand that this is your basic 9/11 formula, where there are tons and tons of people that know someone who died in the event, even very big names like the touring guy for (can't remember) either nsync or backstreet boys.

it's all fake, and jerrica is trying to make these shootings seem more real by using my broadcast as a method give legitimacy to these things -- because if I believe it, then it's definitely real, and they can probably do cuts in just such a way that it looks like I believed her. if I attack her phone, that's not possible though. I just reacted.

---

it's all attraction, and what I think happened is that sesily and remi's conversation attracted a repeat performance. I regret nothing and I *will* act out further if I'm continued to be put in a position where I'm to give legitimacy to fake news. I want nothing to do with any of this

later on, when sitting in the sun, I had a further look into why I was so fixated on killing the phone as if it was the target and I'm a sort of manchurian candidate.

my theory on what is happening there is, they use my body while I'm asleep to program and encode emotions into digital media. I noticed this very very intensely when I watched matrix 4, and I also noticed it when I walked by when you guys were watching that galaxy guardians movie a few years back...

anyway, they encode these news stories with emotion, so that nosebook sends the viewer a visceral feeling of teamwork (in the case of galaxy guardians) or of strong saviour, hero feeling (in the case of matrix), and in this news program, they did the same thing -- they used me to encode the feeling of what's it's like to be the hero guy who attacked the gunman. the news story gave nearly zero data about the shooting and instead was all about this guy's heroic whatever.

I felt like he did, and I behaved precisely as I was programmed to feel -- cept this time I wasn't asleep, but I was awake, so I acted it out without even thinking.

---

by writing this, I'm partially taking the blame for it. the thing is, it's easy to see in hindsight, and I probably won't act that way again --- well, I'm not so sure actually. the feeling is so strong, I cannot, not act.

therefore, the conclusion here is that if they have the capability to make me act based on a strong feeling, the girls thing is super simple for them to make happen. they just do that, but program a different action, instead of killing a gunman. therefore, conclusively, they do *not* want the girls thing to happen, cause they could have caused me to make action if they wanted to. they're giving a big illusion that I'm going in the direction of the girls (remi and melissa's conversation), but at the same time programming me to react in a way which doesn't go toward it.

I'm kinda along for the ride on all of this. from my perspective, I really don't enjoy it. I've been trying to quit the girls thing for quite a while now. I'm very tired of them thinking I'm going in that direction when in fact I am not. I don't want to be involved in any of this stuff. you have to understand my position, which is that I can't really do a whole lot. nobody will actually talk to me about anything. I live a fake life (an illusion someone else makes for me), a and I only talk to actors. I'm absolutely brilliant and I know so much, but I really am tired of this so much that I've considered suicide so many times. I can't get out of this mess, so I just sorta have to find a way to feel the way I want to feel no matter the circumstances.

I'm at the point where I would simply prefer to go and act out in a way which will put me in jail or back in a mental hospital, because it's so much easier to just say forget it, walk away and attract something else (even with a criminal record), than it is for me to keep playing this fake illusion game. I dislike with all of being to constantly be stuck going two directions (the direction of the illusion and the direction of my feeling). all of my life, because of my brain thing, I have to make my action follow the way that I feel, else my body shakes and doesn't work right. the siutation I'm in is the opposite of that. I just want to go the way that I feel. I don't like constantly feeling differently from the way I appear to be going. I'd rather a definite "no" I'm not going to do that, because then I'm free to attract the next thing (my brilliance doesn't matter if I have a criminal record, because I far outperform all of the top scentific and spiritual leaders). I prefer to actually fail, than to continually look like I'm doing something different than I'm doing.

I hope you understand.
