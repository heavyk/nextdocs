### 2022-11-29 12:31 - becoming epimetheus

one of the things that was really important for me to write in [my email to mom](/peeps/mom.md#2022-11-22-1627---my-theory-on-what-happened-today) was that I explained to her that my capacity to figure out a situation *after the fact* is far greater than my capacity to have foresight on a situation.

I explained this concept in spanish last night in proximos-logs. however, I doubt that anyone caught it snuck in there in-between all of the other incoherent (depending on your state of mind) rambling. I decided I would re-render the same concept, but this time in english and with a different angle on it.

what was happening, is last night I finally was able to put words to the difference between the different genders of belief. la belief is different from el belief, which is different from el unbelief, which is also different from la unbelief. let's go over them really quickly. el unbelief is the masculine perspective (we all have it) into things that are considered unlikely/lucky/impossible to happen. these are desires and because they appear unlikely to happen, they can also manifest as fears. more commonly, this is that secret desire that everyone has deep down that some imossible situation *could* happen. it has many names, such as romance, excitment, etc.

this is a sharp contrast to la belief, which is the feminine perspective. these are things that are probable, likely, and expected to happen. for each of these, there is a corresponding justification and also a corresponding reason for it.

now, let's look at el belief in constrast to la belief, which is all the stuff we're "right" about. there is a big difference between being right about something, and saying that something is statistically probable. for la belief, there is a reason, a justification -- something that explains the effect or the action. we recognise these by noticing similar "action points" in the corresponding sequence of actions. I've seen A, B, C, and D, so I know E is right around the corner. this sequence is different from the masculine perspective which is being right about something, because the masculine perspective *doesn't need to be logically sound* to be present. we all have many really illogical things that are founded upon faulty or unlikely logic.

la unbelief is also slightly different from el unbelief in that these are all of the situations that don't have explanation. these are the things that bother us and form the opposite side of the fear aspect (because they're unknown/misunderstood).

those differences are important to see because the illustrate the next great revelation that I saw, which is that when enki and ninhursag were creating humankind, as primitive animals, we weren't capable of taking symbolic instructions, and that was because we were missing this "fire".

I've said before that this fire is our ability to attract things, but that's only looking at one side of the concept. on the other side, it was easy for me to see that in order to take and execute symbolic commands, we need to have a sense that we're doing *the right thing*, and in doing the right thing, we are right.

therefore, it has been the objective of the gods since the day that we got the fire to tell us what is the right way. they authorise our reality by becoming the authority on what is "right". because we all want to be "right", we're caught endlessly trying to fill their description of what is "right". it's pretty easy to see this move around in the hands of religious and governmental institutions. they're called "laws" and they're to be followed.

in a social context, this is the culture of the organisations that you're a part of (family, church, bars, work, school, etc) and what each one of these value. to be a part of that group, you have to adopt their values.

we see this group thought show up all the time in sports and other games of competition as well, because we equate winning with being right -- and if the team/side I'm on is winning, then I'm right about their cause, even if it's putting a ball into a net. I'm winning now too and that makes me right.

the desire to be right about things is "el belief" and, especially in the spanish culture, which can be seen as a macrocosom of our internal mental struggle, el belief is in constant competition with la belief over what is real. el belief is all of the (usually irrational) things that we hold as true. they're often commands that we've been given (like the 10 commandments) and this is mainly what the gods try to manipulate. la belief is all of the stuff that has a reason or a justification for existing, so is therefore likely or probable on some level, and so perceived by most logical people as being "right" (you know like how could a sattelite orbit a plane?)

therefore, this constant conflict between these differenc perxpectives of reality takes on the form of "forethought", which is the ability to predict what will happen in reality, and "afterthought" which is the ability to understand, or justify a previously manifested thing.

the dialectic between these two forces is the fire. we create reality by *being right about it*. the universe aims to ensure that we are right as often as possible about everything we believe.
