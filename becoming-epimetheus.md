# becoming-epimetheus

### 2022-11-29 12:31 - becoming epimetheus

one of the things that was really important for me to write in [my email to mom](/peeps/mom.md#2022-11-22-1627---my-theory-on-what-happened-today) was that I explained to her that my capacity to figure out a situation *after the fact* is far greater than my capacity to have foresight on a situation.

I explained this concept in spanish last night in proximos-logs. however, I doubt that anyone caught it snuck in there in-between all of the other incoherent (depending on your state of mind) rambling. I decided I would re-render the same concept, but this time in english and with a different angle on it.

---

what was happening, is last night I finally was able to put words to the difference between the different genders of belief. *la belief* is different from *el belief*, which is different from el unbelief, which is also different from *la unbelief*. let's go over them really quickly.

*el unbelief* -- is the masculine perspective (we all have it) which is all of the things that are considered unlikely/lucky/impossible to happen. these are desires and because they appear unlikely to happen, they give excitement, life, vigour, to the idea.they also manifest as fears. as a common example, someone has that secret desire deep down that some imossible situation *could* happen, usually to be saved from a situation, accomplish something, conquer something, etc. it has many names, such as romance, excitment, etc.

*la belief* -- is the feminine perspective of the same thing (belief): *la belief* are all the things that are probable, likely, and expected to happen. I think this comes from "keeping the nest" or something of that nature, and for each of these, there is a corresponding justification and also a corresponding reason for it. I think of this as physical programming and resides mostly in the brain. it's possible that it has a conceptual counterpart, but I think those would be the concepts those thoughts empower -- until it gains enough sustain to become a concept itself. that means that (and is everything from fashions to authorship to games), create concepts -- and, I propose that purely material things, like machines can also interact with these concepts, just like we do. we've got the technology to be able to begin to access that universe-wide web of concepts[^1].

*el belief* -- is all the stuff we're "right" about. there is a big difference between being right about something, and saying that something is statistically or logically probable, which is the case for *la belief*, there is a reason, a justification -- something that explains the effect or the action; these are all statistically probable. we use pattern matching to recognise similar concepts, *la belief* is accessed by touching on different "action points" in the corresponding sequence of actions. I've seen A, B, C, and D, so I know E is right around the corner, as an example.

the sequence of action points which composes *la belief* is different from the masculine perspective (*el belief*) which is being right about something. the composition is the same thing: A is right, B is right, C and D also, therefore E is also right. becasue "right" could mean anything, this masculine perspective *doesn't need to it to make sense or to be logically sound* to be exist. it is because it is (I think therefore I am). we all have many really illogical things that are founded upon faulty or unlikely logic, and we're right about each of them.

*la unbelief* -- is simmilar but not indifferent to *el belief*, which are all of the situations that one doesn't have explanation. these are the things that bother us and form the opposite side of the fear aspect (because they're unknown/misunderstood).

(reading el belief again, I noticed the circle)

---

those differences are important to see because they illustrate the next great revelation that I saw, which was how we got to this moment where we began to build our reality out of these four elements. when enki and ninhursag were creating humankind as primitive animals, we weren't capable of taking symbolic instructions, and that was because we were missing this "fire".

this fire is our ability to attract, make things happen, create reality, make tools, solutions, inventions, etc. -- however, that's only looking at one side of the concept: on the other side, it was easy to see that in for us to be able to take and execute symbolic commands, we need to have a sense that we're doing *the right thing*, and in doing the right thing, we are right. the command is the right thing to do. we *want* to follow commands, so we can be *right*.

therefore, it has been the objective of the gods since the day one to tell us which/what way is the "right" way. they authorise our reality by becoming the authority on what is "right". because we all want to be "right", we're caught endlessly trying to fill their description of what is "right". right is a different dimension to legend though, but if you're trained to give importance or power to righeousness, it's pretty easy to see why that would want to be perpetuated. these forms of righteousness pass around and move about in social construtcts, spanning multiple dimensions of social, family, ideological, grouped people. this includes most visible religious and governmental institutions. they're called "laws" cause they're meant to be followed, so we can be "right".

in a social context, this is the culture of the organisations that you're a part of (family, church, bars, work, school, etc) and what each one of these value. to be a part of that group, you have to adopt their values (or hide that you have disdain for them).

we also see this group thought show up all the time in sports and other games of competition as well and this is the beginning of its redeeming factor, because we equate winning with being right -- and if the team/side I'm on is winning, then I'm right about their cause, even if it's putting a ball into a net. I'm winning now too and that makes me right. eventually one learns they already are right, they don't need others to validate it as true, it can be enjoyed like a dream.

---

the desire to be right about things (*el belief*) was especially prominant for me in the spanish culture (and it wasn't until I saw theirs I could see american's need to be right, too). the spanish people and culture as a whole represents to me as a self-similar resonance to the macrocosom of our internal mental struggle of wanting to be right. the desire to be right about things shifted a few times for me in spain and is where I developed this theory so when I say them, I'm referring to how I learned it. I recognised an aspect of myself (this principle of how I'm prdogrammed) in myself as a reflection of their culture (spain is the female and I'm forethought and afterthought as one. she takes those and twists them according to her perception of reality (culture) and spits them back at me in the form of egregores).

*el belief* (things we're right about) is in constant competition with *la belief* over what is real. for her, it's only the stuff that's probable, likely, justified, or logical. *el belief* is all of the things that we hold as true and we're right about them because they're *true*. they're often commands that we've been given and this is mainly what the gods most basic form of manipulation. they're up to new tricks now, but for millenia, our concept of what is right has been manipulated to fight wars, and all kinds of other savagry. *la belief* is all of the stuff that has a reason or a justification for existing and that's pretty ancient as well. we've developed this over time and I beleive that there is probably a genetic component to it. I don't know if there is a genetic component to the other three though. rigth people tend to collect into groups over their ideology. they are physical sattelites, orbiting a concept.

the constant conflict between these different perspectives of what is the definition of reality, takes on the dialectic of "forethought" -- which is the ability to predict what will happen in reality, and "afterthought" -- which is the ability to understand, or justify a previously manifested thing. everything we know and can perceive is a vector between these two dialectics in reference to the perceiver/observer.

the dialectic between these two forces is premetheus' fire. we create reality by *being right about it*. the universe aims to ensure that we are right as often as possible about everything we believe.

[1]: obviously we can only access concepts that are similar to us. as an example, I rarely, and less and less now access an entire section of what most people think of as "reality". those things are largely invisible to me. I walk through the danger like a fool, captivated by my own pontifications.

### 2022-11-29 13:03 - summoning epimetheus

yesterday, there were also quite a few different feelings I had based around the idea of summoning me (or anyone else similar to me). I explained that for me, prometheus has indeed left the building. I have very little capacity now for forethought. if you're anyone like me (which is everyone besides the noseboys and tesla), then the archons are going to be continually keeping from you the capacity to look at conditions and upgrade your performance (epimetheus), but most importantly, they want to control the timeline and what is manifesting inside of it.

this is largely because they have a physical plane they need to maintain. I explained that we're basically living inside of the corona of a 7th ray star, which has been caused to become a higher density layer on the onion. below us (the inner earth) and above us (sky, ionosphere, space) is also of lower density too. seems pretty obvious, but as the star gains more hydrogen (ie becomes more attractive), in order for the physical layer we live on, to continue in the visible spectrum (the physical), it has to maintain the density. well, this becomes quite the task, because if below us gains density, it'll push our layer up, just like if you add a higher density gas (like CO2), it'll cause all of the layers of lower density above it to be displaced vertically.

what this means, is that in order for our physical layer to maintain its density, it has to expand as the pressure rises (like blowing up a ballon). these expansions happen at the "fault lines" and create volcanos/earthquakes as the entire earth expands. the ones that are trying to keep the earth from expanding are doing so to keep the whole planet from getting bigger (and, this I believe the role of vulcan/tesla down at the south pole as the failsafe, but that role has been handed over, probably relatively recently, to the US govt; they're mithras now).

they have a lot of really valid reasons (*la belief*) for keeping the physical plane (the one we live on) at a constant speed/density, sacred geometry and other harmonious ratios, etc, but the final effect is that, by trying to maintain the density of the planet, they are, because of consciousness's intimate connection to density/frequency, they are also limiting the physical conditions which lead to essentially superhuman logical and calculatory capabilities (and all of the singularity stuff).

though our perceptive and rational capbilities have been physically limited by maintaing the densitty, and also preventing the planet from expanding, they've given themselves the most difficultc job to do. it's pretty close to impossible, so we'll see how that turns out (oh, nm -- guess they don't. tesla/vulcan's on it). interesting. anyway, so anyway, they want to keep us and all of the stuff we think of as physical to remain in physical -- pretty obvious. a small thing like beginning to manipulate concepts other than your own could pretty easily cause a chain reaction of expansion (like a child growing, giants, etc.)

so whoopdie, f-ing doo, I say, because it's not necessary to have a higher density or the physical conditions to have superhuman capabilities. for me, I think about things very muchanically, so there are *always* technological (and otherwise) solutions so I'm really not worried about it. concepts exist all over the place in our reality from stories to ideas to inventions which turned into products. everything is a remix, and there's no way to stop expansion of consciousness. that's what this is all about anyway. the way that we expand our consciousness is always on the looking back. the conclussion: I could do that better.

right before you get to forethought, you have afterthought -- a conclusion, a prejudice, a disagreement. this forms to be the launching point from where we decide what to do differently to make an improvement. 

### 2022-11-29 17:30 - I'll pay for that later

this is an aspect very typical of almost all demiurges. almost universally, all of them, including myself and tesla have a typical behaviour of acruing lots and lots of debt. if I have money, I want to spend it.

this idea of "I'll pay for it later" comes from what actually happens vibrationally. any time that a manifestation is gotten to from physical conditions -- music, dance, sex, drugs, etc. then you get to feel some way you don't "normally" do, and so I know a lot of this because I've used drugs to get perspectives by artificially boosting the way I feel. I *always* pay for it later, because when the drug wears off, often times it's a lot harder to get back there.

inevitably the universe tests me to see if I'm actually ready. quickly, I'm not totally sure if that is default behaviour from the universe, native to our DNA, or something I have specifically desired for myself -- but inevitably, the universe makes sure I actually walk my walk and talk my talk. they keep me realistic in my own perception. without it, I would be really far out there and incoprehensible to most. however, because *inevitable* I will be tested to see if my actions align with my words, I attract my own "trial" (we're all our own worst judges).

---

there is a difference between what most demiurges do, which is just accepting that they'll pay for it later and choosing the conditions to boost the sensory realms. I'm the worst offender of this, and quite literally my entire thing is built upon doing things the "wrong way". everything I've done, from the drugs to the spiritual stuff (allowing my self to think paranormal is also normal), is all the "wrong way". I love the wrong way, but I've programmed myself to behave the "right way" for certain situations and actions.

I program myself, because I'm singular, is conceptually. I only have one persona, and that one persona has quite a bit of freedom to move within the conceptual parameters of the thing and the way I feel. if I do nothing, I behave in default mode. whenever I feel bad, an alarm summons me into consciousness and I figure out the new conceptual parameters for the situation (like in my dream state).

because all of my life has been a history of "I'll pay for that later" sort of things -- and it may not look like it, but even now I'm on a drug, and so I'm artificially boosting myself into another feeling. that didn't happen because of my conscious state, so -- first, I wasn't attracting it, and second, I'm not quite ready for it yet -- so I'll pay for it later.

I however, have a potential conceptual upgrade, which is simply to desire or to just expect that the universe will actually test to make sure your words align with reality. I experience this all the time, and so I can say with pretty high certainty that I'm not a fraud, a fake, or a conman. the universe holds me to my words. well -- not quite words, and in fact not words at all. the universe holds me to my concepts. the things that I believe about reality manifest especially if someone else has a contrary belief (nosebook I'm sure is quite aware of this).

this happened, not because of preplanning or forethought for me, but actually as a reaction to my present situation. I used to say a lot of untruths, but I eventually came to hate it and wanted to be honest. I wanted to actually *do what I said I would do*. anyone who's tried it knows that this can be quite a difficult thing. the universe is not setup based on words (even though I am the main critic to terence about this), but actually it's actually made up of concepts. what terence is identifying is that the words do create a reality, but that's an artificial reality which covers over the conceptual one.

by wanting to be held responsible for my concepts of reality, that meant *all* the stuff I believe will begin to manifest into my reality, including the bad stuff, so that means I really have to start to pay attention to what I want to manifest.

so what do I want to manifest? you know, it's a funny thing because I really like to be right (like everyone else), so probably the most desirable manifestation is one where I realise I'm right -- well, wrong. that is no longer my most desirable manifestation; I believe I'm closer to the max novelty (as opposed to contrast) end of the spectrum. contrast (the need to see the border between which one is right) is completely meaningless to me as, novelty is far more exciting than anything else.

novelty is based around your interests. some people have a sad state, where the things that interest them (women, science, fishing) -- they have it all figured out, and there's nothing new to be learned. when they say that, they're also saying there's nothing new to be experienced. *that* is a sad state becuse I don't need to necessarily learn about that specific subject, and it can serve as an inspiration for other things. I can see almost everything in almost anything now, so one thing is always teaching me about another.

and you thought I was going to talk about debt...

### 2022-11-29 18:38 - practise makes perfect

one of the things characteristic of epimetheus is afterthoughth, which is the analysis of the performance. I spoke of it briefly in the previous entry.

like everyone else, I analyse myself intensely, so I'm always "critical" of my performance for certain subjects (but definitely not all). on some subjects I am critical and require a better performance, while others, I just don't care or feel I am too hard to change. when I say that, I'm referring to the physical mind. where all of the "default" programming is installed. most people are there, and they experience life as a series of reactions to conditions. events reoccur in ever strengthening resonance until they finally destroy the person. the intervention here is conscious adjustment to the default programming.

whatever you program can be whatever, and hopefully updated quite frequently. I often laugh at nodejs or chromium with their version numbers, but it's about how I feel about my default programming. I'm probably on version more than 100k, most likely (maybe much more even).

for me, it's not what I put (initially or in any of the revisions), but how quickly I can change it to the next thing. that's when it gets fun.

---

physical change is not even close to the same as mental/conceptual change is for me. I'm quite agile conceptually, and very very rapid, but I just don't have enough new subjects to perceive conceptually. oh... that's not what I meant to say. changing how I "act" phyically is usually quite a difficult thing. the physical "act" has to be compatible with my concepts and how I feel, else it'll feel stiff and difficult to move. it doesn't "get" the concept, and doesn't know how to turn that concept into physical movement. this is essentially what I teach myself. the way something moves is it's frequency. I can easily identify negative emotion when someone moves because their movement carries the concept of their thoughts.

therefore, for physical change, it's important to use repitition to "teach" the body how to respond under certain conceptual conditions. this is learned early on, I think mostly from the mother and shapes how you begin to move. I notice it most commonly with the mother and her kids, but I suppose if I stayed around marcos house and got to know the father, I would have begun to get a sense of childen taking on the conceptual movement patterns of their parents.

I plan to try and do the scene a few more times after the snow melts, this time trying to become more mime-like[^1], in how I interact with objects that aren't there, but the major problem is, I sorta feel a little silly (and always have) when acting, is believing that the object I'm interacting with, is actually there. because everyone else is acting, I can't see them like real people for me to interact with, so I don't; I let them do the attracting, so I fit whatever they want to manifest.

so, you can see now that this is kinda a problem for me in the sense of acting. so, I don't really plan on trying to get the motion pretty good. I'll probably just keep doing small gestures and work on the conceptaul aspect of the idea. I feel like I should be a little better about how I concernedly distance myself emotionally from the signal and just drift off into my thoughts, only to realise quite a few cycles later that it doesn't work.

in addition to the idea, I want to update the original one, because I was thinking I should try and take a little hore extra time. you know those pranksters like borat or whatever where he takes something to the extreme thing. like what if I waited there for reals like 20m or something, really waiting a long time for the signal and getting angry because it's not changing, etc., all on the heels of attracting the worst possible light arrival of undesired situations like cars pulling in front of me or whatever (LOA always helps the drivers that want me to show off my poor navigation of roads, to find me).

the funny thing for me really is just feeling the way I want to feel. I'm getting to where situations just kinda don't really "phase me" anymore. I just sorta "roll with it" all the time now.

so, for me it's kinda fun to just try out new feelings just for the fun of it. the feelings are sorta random to me, and so a lot of how that gets translated into thoughts for you guys to make the manifestation, I don't know, so I find it fun to feel funny, random, or meaningless (to me) feelings and see how you all react. I'm a bit of a trickster that way because I love learning how others respond to my vibration.

as I try the same situation with different feelings going into it, I begin to attract new ideas for the "skit" because it's not yet physical for me. I just make general goals (like go home) and then feel whatever way -- sometimes I modify (though I think we all do) -- I modify the way an idea feels to me. I want it to feel better (or worse), so I change how it feels. each iteration of this produces a slightly different "act" from me.

I get a lot of inspiration for how I feel when I'm around others (as opposed to by myself), from others. by default, I'm pure reflection, but I make exceptions for others, usually because it's the "right" thing to do. most everyone inspires me, and I take how they feel, modify it to my liking (because I always have a better idea of how to do it than everyone else) and then do *my version* of it; I do everyone else's concepts (that interest me) better than everyone else does.

I really can find humour in just about anything, but the nice thing about LOA is that all I have to do is to desire to have humourous situations happen (though most are in the no-fun-zone), so I mostly just enjoy the jokes myself. as a result, my life is really funny at times, because I desired it. it just happens. often.

serious people were always really funny to me. one of my first screennames was seriousmoose (I think) -- well, it was one of the first because I thought seriousness for a moose was funny because a moose is already serious. have you ever seen a playful moose? it's funny because it states the obvious.

---

interacting with really serious business-types was a completely new experience for me. I really started to flourish when I lived at marcos' house because I saw these serioumcmoose in their native habitat. I had no concept of this, so I learned pretty quickly to tell them always what they want to hear, joke around and have fun, but never when they're "serious". I definitely stomp on that boundary.

however, I started to "get" them, and I began to learn their language of interaction. I started to begin to be able to interact with people and put jokes and other fun things while still maintaining *my* level of serious behaviour which is comparable to a child. as such, they treat me a bit like a kid because that's what I look like to them. I'm their sorta "serious" kryptonite. I may have learned that one from andrea.

I got the first part of that inspiration actually from ali g. I couldn't belive how such a ridiculously dressed guy saying some of the dumbest stuff can keep a straight face. I find that too funny to be able to do properly. so in order to dabble in the absurdity, I had to find a way that isn't funny to me. this is probably where ego comes in. yep, ego saves the day here, because by knowing that whatever is "true", then it's no longer funny to me.

most people unfortunately experience my "truth" not at all as funny, but perhaps a bit harsh or whatever. for me, those are all jokes. the absurd has a bit of humour in it for me. I can't help but to laugh at the things I don't understand.

so, to be able to do the joke with a straight face, I have to understand the concept in a way that "completes it", meaning it no longer gives me an emotional response. I no longer see the humour in the joke. in fact, it receives a purely unanimated response from me. it wasn't funny, painful, offensive, maddening, or absurd. just an obvious thing. my ability to look back and understand something is unmatched, and I'm really good at applying this to real-life situations, but using that skill to do what borat does (only where he keeps a straight face), could be really good. I just say obvious stuff and these are jokes to you all still because you don't quite understand it yet.. interesting.

[1]: for some reason, I remembered that joe really doesn't like mimes or something about sadness (can't remember now).

### 2022-11-30 14:31 - I'll pay for that later (part two)

one of the things about afterthought or regret is that you can see it however you want to see it. we know that memories change, but nobody I know has an answer to it. I put fourth my theory, which is that memories are tied to our being, and as we change, so do our memories.

as an interesting side note, I'd like to mention that I believe that memories may be the medium of another dimension, in which that energy supports these egregores that have been summoned here and are doomed to exist how they are so long as they're given continual attention? have you noticed that it's all about marketing for attention and really if you cause a lot of trouble, you get a lot of attention, but you also get attention other ways (ie    marketing), but that attention is what gives you consciousness, more connection to reality -- a richer and more vibrant experience. that's what everyone wants.

we can now think of memories as the empowering fluid upon which this medium exists, and out of it are projected these unchanging concepts manifest into phyisicality. they persist as long as we keep giving them attention. we live in a world of these unchanging concepts.

I too was one of these unchanging concepts (I believe) -- egregores born out of tantric creation principles. then though various means (all things that shape consciousness, from language, to drugs, sex, rock and roll, and all things creative), I began to consider to construct a new image of myself -- one to my own liking, and shed the skin of my previous definition (the egregore).

that egregore is the one that is powered by this medium of memories. we are our own creations. this, now speaks of an underlying superform; the concept of our species.

imagine that we (the superform) are constantly creating the images of ourselves based on how we remember ourselves. these created beings/egeregores from memories continue to interact with each other making more and more and more. it's a virus fueled and empowered by contrast/drama. we (the superform) rely on this to continue to evolve our definition of ourself as a "singular" species.

---

therefore, memory is important to know that it can become whatever you want it to be. it does that naturally all by itself because you change. if you don't change, or feel like it's impossible for you to change, it's because you're an egregore. you are a definition created by someone and summoned into existence by someone's creative or sexual energy (the fire energy). this is forethought.

in order to break out of the bondage of your own prescribed definitions born out of forethtought, you have to master the art of afterthought. learn to see your regrets, shoulds, and musts a different way and you'll master the art of afterthought.

you are the author and defifition of yourself. in the sense of the son, the 4d, the author, you are a continually evolving story. from the fool, the 3d, the definition, you're stuck the way you are.

so, you want to become the author of yoursellf, and I'm sure that so many people are really good at seeing themself differently, this is the son, the author. it's important to begin to see oneself also from the fool, the reality, definition, the "real" you -- as well.

the reason for this is pretty obvious, which is that the author is a story. the story isn't who you really are. *you* are in this body in this physical location, doing these physical things, and so therefore one has to become OK, and/or even friends with the reality of your situation; the fool.

your definition of yourself is everything, so it's important to notice for myself what I'm constructing my definition with. some people construct their definition with words, others with images, products, sex, etc. -- and here, more than anything else, *the medium is the message*. if you're defining yourself with the concept of sex, you can only receive like for what you put out. so, choose what mediums you use to define yourself.

my definitions of myself give me energy, and also power. if
I define myself, I'm aligning myself to that definition. if
that definition is getting stronger, it gives me energy. you
can probably see herd mentality now, now...

---

now, when I use something to artificially boost the way I feel, I know that I'll pay for that later. that happens because I accessed something I wasn't supposed to access by artificially modifying the way I feel. this is is the forbidden fruit, because you're cheating, sort of getting around the normal mental guardian angels that keep us out of that information, drugs, sex, music, poetry, visualisation, can all artificially boost us to a different way of feeling, which then attracts reality. that reality which is attracted is at a different vibration than what I'm at -- so you can imagine this like two galaxies collidding or something, becasue they're not compatible, they're attracting or repusing.

attraction is just as much of an incompatible force as repulsion. therefore, because I'm at a different vibration in the future when I run into my attraction/egregore/manifestation/whatever, that causes another reaction based on our difference. this is how two vibrations/consciousnesses "learn" from each other. that dfference is the thing you have to "pay" later.

so, then this is where epimetheus steps in, because in all of these situations where you have to pay for it later, look at how for some of them, especially the ones where considerable time has passed, they don't appear as bad anymore. our afterthought *can* change, and even they do without you knowing it, because they ebb and flow on the tide of the medium of memory.

eventually, those payments that need to be made look a lot less like debts, and more like just things that happened all the way up to positive learning experiences --- meaning, of course that the only debt collector is your own concept of the experience. you don't have to pay the debt if you don't see it like debt anymore. this is probably true financially as well, but I was meaning vibrationally -- as in if I interacted with someone, I made a vibrational debt which I'll pay for later. time will pass and eventually those debts are all viewed as things that happened up to positive learning experiences --- and, the things we're still going to pay a debt for: your "sins", your good ideas, your insight, your steering, your efforts. you are the debt collector, just so you know...

### 2022-11-30 15:20 - shedding skake skin and becoming new each time

... like the sun/son. each of these definitions is sort of like our snake-skin (according to russ's snake-bros meme concept), and these are our physical definitions of ourselves. they live purely in the physical -- as in, in your brain. thoubh others can manipulate your snake-skin before you shed it, but there is an overarching concept that you have of yourself which the physical body has to find a way to "keep to to speed" with, else you die.

you have physical definitions of yourself. this is a concept empowered through memory, which is experience. this memory changes though as you begin to redefine your past, turning those memories into concepts, which you then use to author your reality.

then, you have your imaginal definitions of yourself. I expose these definitions as the dialectic between the son/sun and the fool. these, in their optial from are continually reborn as sol invictus. I represent the sides of this dialectic as prometheus (dreams, aspirations, forethought) and epimetheus (regrets, sorows, bitterness, hatred, etc.) those afterthought defninitions of oneself in the past is the snake-skin, and so renewal is important to maintain the cycle constant at its desired speed.

finally you have your definitions of "who you really are". this is one part your "source" concepts, and one part what you actually believe about yourself (7th). this I beleive is empowered by everthing that you believe (3rd *el belief*, *la unbelief*) and what you desire (1st - *la belief*, el unbelief). that sexual/creative energy is what powers these memories and definitions; it is life.

### 2022-11-30 15:47 - when prometheus and epimetheus collide

imagine these two concepts of oneself (the concepts created from the imaginal forthought and afterthought) as two galaxies. when these galaxies collide, the angle of their collision, velocity, etc. all create the different versions of "yourself". for one person, you're a collision at one angle, and with another a different angle and velocity. these memories or concepts one has *is* the fluid substance that empowers the physical body (and all of reality). these collisions are constantly being made in reference to another person's perspective. every interaction, the magnitude of the emotional aspects is the velocity, spin, angle, etc. the galaxies are each person's concept of theirself (their forethought/afterthought).

now, we can look at this collision in the form of a triad. I (kenny) have my two males, forthought/emitter and afterthought/ground, and they will interact with a psycho woman -- a concept of foreign specifiction, unsafe, unpredictable. she takes the concept, manipulates it, then re-emits it back to me as a twisted form of myself. that's kinda what we're dealing with. that's pretty much how it always works from this physical perspective. I've gotten used to it. anyway, a galaxy has two parts to it, one of forethought and one of afterthought, just like you do. the stars represent its female -- just like the human body and all the celluar stuff. basically everything. they run the show. they turn on the lights, etc. lol. once I learned that the entire universe is built that way, I had no other choice but to become OK with it. I suppose it could be improved.
