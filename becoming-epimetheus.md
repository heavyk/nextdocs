# becoming-epimetheus

### 2022-11-29 12:31 - becoming epimetheus

one of the things that was really important for me to write in [my email to mom](/peeps/mom.md#2022-11-22-1627---my-theory-on-what-happened-today) was that I explained to her that my capacity to figure out a situation *after the fact* is far greater than my capacity to have foresight on a situation.

I explained this concept in spanish last night in proximos-logs. however, I doubt that anyone caught it snuck in there in-between all of the other incoherent (depending on your state of mind) rambling. I decided I would re-render the same concept, but this time in english and with a different angle on it.

---

what was happening, is last night I finally was able to put words to the difference between the different genders of belief. la belief is different from el belief, which is different from el unbelief, which is also different from la unbelief. let's go over them really quickly. el unbelief is the masculine perspective (we all have it) into things that are considered unlikely/lucky/impossible to happen. these are desires and because they appear unlikely to happen, they can also manifest as fears. more commonly, this is that secret desire that everyone has deep down that some imossible situation *could* happen. it has many names, such as romance, excitment, etc.

this is a sharp contrast to la belief, which is the feminine perspective. these are things that are probable, likely, and expected to happen. for each of these, there is a corresponding justification and also a corresponding reason for it.

now, let's look at el belief in constrast to la belief, which is all the stuff we're "right" about. there is a big difference between being right about something, and saying that something is statistically probable. for la belief, there is a reason, a justification -- something that explains the effect or the action. we recognise these by noticing similar "action points" in the corresponding sequence of actions. I've seen A, B, C, and D, so I know E is right around the corner. this sequence is different from the masculine perspective which is being right about something, because the masculine perspective *doesn't need to be logically sound* to be present. we all have many really illogical things that are founded upon faulty or unlikely logic.

la unbelief is also slightly different from el unbelief in that these are all of the situations that don't have explanation. these are the things that bother us and form the opposite side of the fear aspect (because they're unknown/misunderstood).

---

those differences are important to see because the illustrate the next great revelation that I saw, which is that when enki and ninhursag were creating humankind, as primitive animals, we weren't capable of taking symbolic instructions, and that was because we were missing this "fire".

I've said before that this fire is our ability to attract things, but that's only looking at one side of the concept. on the other side, it was easy for me to see that in order to take and execute symbolic commands, we need to have a sense that we're doing *the right thing*, and in doing the right thing, we are right.

therefore, it has been the objective of the gods since the day that we got the fire to tell us what is the right way. they authorise our reality by becoming the authority on what is "right". because we all want to be "right", we're caught endlessly trying to fill their description of what is "right". it's pretty easy to see this move around in the hands of religious and governmental institutions. they're called "laws" and they're to be followed.

in a social context, this is the culture of the organisations that you're a part of (family, church, bars, work, school, etc) and what each one of these value. to be a part of that group, you have to adopt their values.

we see this group thought show up all the time in sports and other games of competition as well, because we equate winning with being right -- and if the team/side I'm on is winning, then I'm right about their cause, even if it's putting a ball into a net. I'm winning now too and that makes me right.

---

the desire to be right about things is "el belief" and, especially in the spanish culture, which can be seen as a macrocosom of our internal mental struggle, el belief is in constant competition with la belief over what is real. el belief is all of the (usually irrational) things that we hold as true. they're often commands that we've been given (like the 10 commandments) and this is mainly what the gods try to manipulate. la belief is all of the stuff that has a reason or a justification for existing, so is therefore likely or probable on some level, and so perceived by most logical people as being "right" (you know like how could a sattelite orbit a plane?)

therefore, this constant conflict between these differenc perxpectives of reality takes on the form of "forethought", which is the ability to predict what will happen in reality, and "afterthought" which is the ability to understand, or justify a previously manifested thing.

the dialectic between these two forces is the fire. we create reality by *being right about it*. the universe aims to ensure that we are right as often as possible about everything we believe.

### 2022-11-29 13:03 - summoning epimetheus

yesterday, there were also quite a few different feelings I had based around the idea of summoning me (or anyone else similar to me). I explained that for me, prometheus has indeed left the building. I have very little capacity now for forethought. if you're anyone like me (which is everyone besides the noseboys and tesla), then the archons are going to be continually keeping from you the capacity to look at conditions and upgrade your performance (epimetheus), but most importantly, they want to control the timeline and what is manifesting inside of it.

this is largely because they have a physical plane they need to maintain. I explained that we're basically living inside of the corona of a 7th ray star, which has been caused to become a higher density layer on the onion. below us (the inner earth) and above us (sky, ionosphere, space) is also of lower density too. seems pretty obvious, but as the star gains more hydrogen (ie becomes more attractive), in order for the physical layer we live on to stay tuned to density/frequency of the physical, it has to maintain the density. well, this becomes quite the task, because if below us gains density, it'll push our layer up, just like if you add a higher density gas (like CO2), it'll cause all of the layers of lower density above it to be displaced vertically.

what this means, is that in order for our physical layer to maintain its density, it has to expand as the pressure rises (like blowing up a ballon). these expansions happen at the "fault lines" and create v volcanos/earthquakes as the entire earth expands. the ones that are trying to keep the earth from expanding are doing so to keep the whole planet from getting bigger.

they have a lot of really valid reasons (la belief) for doing this, sacred geometry and other harmonious ratios, etc, but the final effect is that, by trying to maintain the density of the planet, they are, because of consciousness's intimate connection to density/frequency, also attempting to limit our perceptive and rational capbilities. they can't allow anything other than physical stuff to manifest inside of the physical, else it'll start a chain reaction of expansion (like a child growing, giants, etc.)

so whoopdie, f-ing doo, I say, because it's not necessary to have a higher density, even though the star below us is also going to have one. I could see pretty clearly all of the different ways that they're going to keep our planet at its "proper" size. eventually though, the planet (just like at the end of the last ice age) will have to expand again. it'll expand, probably pretty big. I estimate somewhere the size of a tiny galaxy, and the crazy thing will be is, it'll be (on the inside) a zone of having an internal sun and a very large space. to those on the outside, it'll probably look like a pretty big planet.

at first, this new extremely large planet will be something like how earth was when enki and friends first found it, and it'll need the proper pyramids and other things orbiting it (like the moon) to ensure that the physical layer is maintained at a certain frequency. it's possible though that instead of having a physical layer like we know now, it'll be composed almost excclusively of lower density layers like the astral and conceptual. so, when I say "planet" consider that I'm meaning a layered onion of differing densities, as opposed to a star which is a point of higher and higher density hydrogen. a star (like our own), can be caused to behave like a planet (by making layers in its atmosphere of varying densities), but it is, just a clump of really dense very rapidly vibrating hydrogen.

(long tangent there... I'll get to the summoning soon)

### 2022-11-29 17:30 - I'll pay for that later

this is an aspect very typical of almost all demiurges. almost universally, all of them, including myself and tesla have a typical behaviour of acruing lots and lots of debt. if I have money, I want to spend it.

this idea of "I'll pay for it later" comes from what actually happens vibrationally. any time that a manifestation is gotten to from physical conditions -- music, dance, sex, drugs, etc. then you get to feel some way you don't "normally" do, and so I know a lot of this because I've used drugs to get perspectives by artificially boosting the way I feel. I *always* pay for it later, because when the drug wears off, often times it's a lot harder to get back there.

inevitably the universe tests me to see if I'm actually ready. quickly, I'm not totally sure if that is default behaviour from the universe, native to our DNA, or something I have specifically desired for myself -- but inevitably, the universe makes sure I actually walk my walk and talk my talk. they keep me realistic in my own perception. without it, I would be really far out there and incoprehensible to most. however, because *inevitable* I will be tested to see if my actions align with my words, I attract my own "trial" (we're all our own worst judges).

---

there is a difference between what most demiurges do, which is just accepting that they'll pay for it later and choosing the conditions to boost the sensory realms. I'm the worst offender of this, and quite literally my entire thing is built upon doing things the "wrong way". everything I've done, from the drugs to the spiritual stuff (allowing my self to think paranormal is also normal), is all the "wrong way". I love the wrong way, but I've programmed myself to behave the "right way" for certain situations and actions.

I program myself, because I'm singular, is conceptually. I only have one persona, and that one persona has quite a bit of freedom to move within the conceptual parameters of the thing and the way I feel. if I do nothing, I behave in default mode. whenever I feel bad, an alarm summons me into consciousness and I figure out the new conceptual parameters for the situation (like in my dream state).

because all of my life has been a history of "I'll pay for that later" sort of things -- and it may not look like it, but even now I'm on a drug, and so I'm artificially boosting myself into another feeling. that didn't happen because of my conscious state, so -- first, I wasn't attracting it, and second, I'm not quite ready for it yet -- so I'll pay for it later.

I however, have a potential conceptual upgrade, which is simply to desire or to just expect that the universe will actually test to make sure your words align with reality. I experience this all the time, and so I can say with pretty high certainty that I'm not a fraud, a fake, or a conman. the universe holds me to my words. well -- not quite words, and in fact not words at all. the universe holds me to my concepts. the things that I believe about reality manifest especially if someone else has a contrary belief (nosebook I'm sure is quite aware of this).

this happened, not because of preplanning or forethought for me, but actually as a reaction to my present situation. I used to say a lot of untruths, but I eventually came to hate it and wanted to be honest. I wanted to actually *do what I said I would do*. anyone who's tried it knows that this can be quite a difficult thing. the universe is not setup based on words (even though I am the main critic to terence about this), but actually it's actually made up of concepts. what terence is identifying is that the words do create a reality, but that's an artificial reality which covers over the conceptual one.

by wanting to be held responsible for my concepts of reality, that meant *all* the stuff I believe will begin to manifest into my reality, including the bad stuff, so that means I really have to start to pay attention to what I want to manifest.

so what do I want to manifest? you know, it's a funny thing because I really like to be right (like everyone else), so probably the most desirable manifestation is one where I realise I'm right -- well, wrong. that is no longer my most desirable manifestation; I believe I'm closer to the max novelty (as opposed to contrast) end of the spectrum. contrast (the need to see the border between which one is right) is completely meaningless to me as, novelty is far more exciting than anything else.

novelty is based around your interests. some people have a sad state, where the things that interest them (women, science, fishing) -- they have it all figured out, and there's nothing new to be learned. when they say that, they're also saying there's nothing new to be experienced. *that* is a sad state becuse I don't need to necessarily learn about that specific subject, and it can serve as an inspiration for other things. I can see almost everything in almost anything now, so one thing is always teaching me about another.

and you thought I was going to talk about debt...
