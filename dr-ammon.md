I came across his channel ([ladybabylon666](https://www.youtube.com/@ladybabylon666)) through [gnostic-informant](https://www.youtube.com/@GnosticInformant). I watched a few of the streams and commented some of my ideas in [my section on gnostic-informant](/gnostic-informant.md), howver, I feel like I've come to have enough ideas that I do want to dedicate a whole section here to some of my ideas. I may put some of the questions I have as well into his discord at a later point, but for now -- I just want to use this as a place for me to write out my most deranged ideas.
