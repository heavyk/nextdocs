I came across his channel ([ladybabylon666](https://www.youtube.com/@ladybabylon666)) through [gnostic-informant](https://www.youtube.com/@GnosticInformant). I watched a few of the streams and commented some of my ideas in [my section on gnostic-informant](/gnostic-informant.md), howver, I feel like I've come to have enough ideas that I do want to dedicate a whole section here to some of my ideas. I may put some of the questions I have as well into his discord at a later point, but for now -- I just want to use this as a place for me to write out my most deranged ideas.

## questions
### 2023-04-17 16:17 - broad and narrow road
> are the broad and narrow road sexual organs?

it just seems that way... the broad road is the one that everyone travels on, but the narrow road seems a bit more youthful(?). the broad and wide gate is the one that everyone goes through and leads to destruction, but the narrow one, few people find.

### 2023-04-17 16:19 - the golden rule
> is "do to other men as you'd have them do to you" referring sexual positions?

it sure seems that way, but I don't know the ancient greek so I can't really comment on the verbs and how they're used.

## thoughts
### 2023-04-17 17:00 - eternal life

you said that eternal life is an absurdity and doesn't exist -- saying that it's ionic time/life instead, yet I do not think that's that's the case at all, because both are happening.

all energy/thought/perception/understanding (everything) is in movement, and so any "life" or energetic manifestation appears for an ion, and then transforms/transitions into another manifestation of (its own perception of) itself eternally; always, even the universe or the "all that is" God, satan, or whatever is always doing this.

the ion of ions is just the thing that came before the present ion -- or, said another way, it's the old preception that transformed into the new perception.

#### 2023-04-17 17:17 - everyone has eternal and ionic life

what the church is doing, is like selling icecubes to eskimos: you already have an abundance of the thing they're selling you. they're just exploiting ignorance by withholding knowlede; that's all.
almost certainly they know that every thing is constantly transforming into something greater than it previously was -- cause why else would they ban alchemy? alchemical principles show that eternal life and continuing expansion is a property of all forms of matter. so if an base substance can be turned into something greater without having to pay for it or earn it in some way, their entire sham falls apart.

### 2023-04-17 18:08 - if this is all about reason...

> if this is all about reason, then I should be able to prove the magic ([ref](https://youtu.be/PGGKe3V3XYk?t=2668))

have you ever been in a situation where someone who is a doubter wants you to perform something they don't believe in?
it's difficult, cause they don't have *faith* (evidence of things unseen :))

### 2023-04-17 18:16 - vowels as tones

I noticed that during [the explanation of the vowels](https://youtu.be/PGGKe3V3XYk?t=2853), I was reminded of "[the mithras liturgy](https://archive.org/details/mithrasliturgy0000unse)" where I was reading it and they have these vowel sequences that correspond to historical ray progressions in the incantation (that's a thing I can get into later) -- and so these sequences of tones correspond (in a greater sense) to passages of time (look on page 2). and there is (for bar, I'll use lowercase) AEeIOYo. that's our sequence there where A = 1 ... o = 7. I map these directy on to the rays, so then when later I look at the incantations, there are some progressions: "eY eIA Ee" (36 341 23), and then the second one "YeI AYI EYoYE" (634 124 26762). so there you can imagine an astral being (6) finding the symbolic through venus/ra (3) then down to saturn/spectral (4). followed by desire/chaos (1) then to big-picture/christ (2), then finally to saturn/spectral (4). the last one is big-picture/christ (2) to astral (6), down to physical/metric (7), then back up to astral (6), then back to big-picture/christ (2).
each of those tone sequences tells a story: the first is one that starts in astral and then does some shadow work (venus/hecate), before making it down to witchraft/saturn/satan.
the second is one that has powerful desire or chaos in their life (1), finds that desire to be found in christ (2), then ultimately finds theirself having been plugged into saturn/satan the whole time.
the third one starts out in christ perception (2), but that's too big and incomprehensible for actual daily life (like for example what does it *actually mean* to be a "christian" or to follow jesus the way he did), so you end up watcering down and living in astral/imagination/fantasy (6). that doesn't work out well at all either, so we've got to stick to physical facts, tangible things, etc. (7), but that's quite limited because just physical has a short/limited perception of time (or even the bigger picture and the evidence is saying there's much more), so then now back to dreaming of what all those things could mean again (6), and thmen finally finding that all things are expanding growing and changing in the big-picture again.

these vowel sequences tell of a temporal progression for the initiate and tune them to these experiences by using the voice to produce tones which resonate with those temporal sequence (obviously for theirself).

after that, I noticed that the way that multiple vowels are used in a word, have different rising and falling effects on my perception as I speak the word -- and those rising and falling sequences match tthe esoteric "character" of the word used in the greater metaphor of the speech.
