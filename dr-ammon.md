I came across his channel ([ladybabylon666](https://www.youtube.com/@ladybabylon666)) through [gnostic-informant](https://www.youtube.com/@GnosticInformant). I watched a few of the streams and commented some of my ideas in [my section on gnostic-informant](/gnostic-informant.md), howver, I feel like I've come to have enough ideas that I do want to dedicate a whole section here to some of my ideas. I may put some of the questions I have as well into his discord at a later point, but for now -- I just want to use this as a place for me to write out my most deranged ideas.

## questions
### 2023-04-17 16:17 - broad and narrow road
> are the broad and narrow road sexual organs?

it just seems that way... the broad road is the one that everyone travels on, but the narrow road seems a bit more youthful(?). the broad and wide gate is the one that everyone goes through and leads to destruction, but the narrow one, few people find.

### 2023-04-17 16:19 - the golden rule
> is "do to other men as you'd have them do to you" referring sexual positions?

it sure seems that way, but I don't know the ancient greek so I can't really comment on the verbs and how they're used.

### 2023-04-17 21:22 - garden of eden

are you suggesting, that the cataclysmic events described when adam and eve are kicked out of the garden of eden happened because someone used snake venom (drugs) and sex to reach an enlightened state where we could perceive *reasonably* the difference between good and evil?

therefore, what I believe is happening here is that this is actually what caused the evolution in human consciousness to produce the next "aryan root race" -- and since reason (and narrative) as a method to produce *belief* (or any not yet material evidence of something unseen) is largely a 3rd ray perspective, ruled by venus. (following my intuition here, this seems related to zarathustra and whatever kinky stuff he was in to.)

I personally don't really want to be repeating adam and eve's footsteps in the sense of producing a new human species that causes such a massive destruction because of ambition and dissatisfaction: desire. therefore, it makes perfect sense that the next progression to the sequence of "root races" will be caused from desire. the early transition into the aryan reasonable mindset is likely the cause for the lilith stuff in the early hebrew tradition (see dr. sledge), as their attempts to reason about what this desirous entity could possibly be (and the resulting YHVH), is the main result of ill-conceived and then manifest desire.

anyway, that sequence of thoughts gave me an idea, which I'd like to share: we're having the psychedellic revoluttion coming upon us here, and there are seemingly a lot of witches that like to do shadow work and tantric pracctises. combine this with my continued depth of perception, it feels to me that sometime in the next decade or so, someone will be able to take these snake venoms and synthesise a compound that is something like MDMA where you feel that "cosmic love" (I know I'm using a lot of steiner ideas here), and then they could conceive a new child that is a shadow of that light cast by lucifer (the reflection of hecate on to the wall from the symbols produced by the shadow work).

inotherwords, what I'm saying is that if someone wants to produce the next "root race", you've given them all of the tools here in your satanic initiation: use my form of perception (lucifer's light) and then do the shadow work, so that the child created (from the rev 12 woman) will contain all of the components necessary to produce the next evolution.

you know, I've been thinking about this a lot yesterday after writing the thing about the blue and red pill, because I've perceived 7 layers of perception, however I only use 4 of them. a few years back I produced another set of 4 because I started to see reality temporally (I had a sexual encounter that transferred to me saturnian perception -- and though I don't actually have any visuals, I can "see" what the saturnians see without seeing it just fine). anyway, those new 4 layers of perception are based on an outside-in form of perception -- where essentially, all things come to the person/group/entity/being through a sort of narrated perception (you know, the ironic thing is I named the part of perception able to perceive the whole narration of entire group of entities/identities as YHVH percetion) so anyway, what I'm saying here is that I find that to likely be the next form of perception, as it feels to me that is in fact, what people are wanting.

the other interesting thing about that form of perception is that *all* things are blended, meaning that there's no absolute truth anywhere, and so things are also pretty slippery in the sense that it's possible to find a connection from one thing to another with some simple word play or alternate interpretation of the images/symbols -- inotherwords, spectral in nature -- a kind of return back to the primordial state of mind.

I'd like to point out that the reason why I believe the previous cataclysm occured is because of the spectral sense of things. I've done a lot of drugs in my life and I know that it's REALLY EASY to make a connection from one thing to another and all of a sudden it's just taken a really big down turn. as a result, I've anchored myself in the primary aspects of desire, symbol/form/structure, concept/emotion, and physicality/data -- as anything outside of those can quickly transform into something unwanted -- and I believe that's precisely what happened during the cataclysm: things are going along fine, but then before one knows it, suddenly meaning feels reversed, and now all of a sudden it's hard to make sense of reality anymore because anything could mean/be anything and our thoughts ultimately turn into whatever we perceive them to be (shadow work).
like I said, those states are easy for me to navigate because I can rely on pure logic and emotion before trying to sort out the physical "evidence" or the desire/chaos surrounding it. however, it's not often the case that people want to believe that their emotions are a direct connection to their non-physical logical perception, and it's actually the image which obscures that perception (because images and the symbols they have produce in people emotions reflective of their perception).
so, what I'm trying to say here is tthat, for those that want to take the red pill and see how deep/tall/complex the rabbit/reality hole/tower can go, then an infinitely blended approach is going to be really a good way of going about it.

what ultimately happens in the rebirthing sequence is that one ventures out into the journey for as long as they still haven't figured out what they're looking for -- which is what they want: to find/discover/realise something -- and then they want to bring it back. this is ultimately the core of all deep shamanistic/drug experiences -- and it's also a fractal of human life -- where, we start out of the womb where everything is a spectral blur, but then we start making sense of shapes and sounds, and that eventually grows into understanding, which then someone turns into something. the narrative journey toward that discovery, and then the coming back, and then doing something with, and then its reception/accolades -- are what all of these things are all about.
personally, I used to love to do drugs because I could see really intricate things with my mind, find clever things to say and then I could blow people's minds with them -- and so I used my own "ego" and desire to get others' recognition of my ideas found in these drug experiences as a way to feel good -- but ultimately, nobody really cares. everyone wants to discover it for theirselves and draw their own lines in the blurry expanse of life, and find out for theirself what are their "primary" forms of perception.
it's too hard to say exactly what the "primary" forms of perception were before the cataclysm (though I could probably figure it out if I dedicated some time to it), however one thing I'm certain of, is that they are not the ones that we have now (whether it's the 4 that I have or some other ones)

the thing is, I'm not really that interested in making this new evolution happen though, as I'm not really one of those outside-in people. further, I'm actually interested in going the opposite way, which is to get rid of inside visuals completely (letting them be their conceptual/symbolic/desire forms, without blend). I've come to gather the opinion that it's often the receptive men which have this outside-in form of perception (though my listening to nikki and miyara suggest that some girls also), so anyway -- I'm not even the right kind of person for the job -- but it's probably possible to make that happen, anyway.

finally I'd like to state that just like a newborn has a parent which does net see life as a blur, it's possible for them to grow up, coming eventually (over some years) to discover for theirself the way that they're going to make sense of the blurriness, forming their own concepts and symbolic interpretations; and so, in the same way, it's pretty likely that I'll be a good stabilising force for those that want to peer into the black dark reality hole (harbour).

## thoughts
### 2023-04-17 17:00 - eternal life

you said that eternal life is an absurdity and doesn't exist -- saying that it's ionic time/life instead, yet I do not think that's that's the case at all, because both are happening.

all energy/thought/perception/understanding (everything) is in movement, and so any "life" or energetic manifestation appears for an ion, and then transforms/transitions into another manifestation of (its own perception of) itself eternally; always, even the universe or the "all that is" God, satan, or whatever is always doing this.

the ion of ions is just the thing that came before the present ion -- or, said another way, it's the old preception that transformed into the new perception.

#### 2023-04-17 17:17 - everyone has eternal and ionic life

what the church is doing, is like selling icecubes to eskimos: you already have an abundance of the thing they're selling you. they're just exploiting ignorance by withholding knowlede; that's all.
almost certainly they know that every thing is constantly transforming into something greater than it previously was -- cause why else would they ban alchemy? alchemical principles show that eternal life and continuing expansion is a property of all forms of matter. so if an base substance can be turned into something greater without having to pay for it or earn it in some way, their entire sham falls apart.

### 2023-04-17 18:08 - if this is all about reason...

> if this is all about reason, then I should be able to prove the magic ([ref](https://youtu.be/PGGKe3V3XYk?t=2668))

have you ever been in a situation where someone who is a doubter wants you to perform something they don't believe in?
it's difficult, cause they don't have *faith* (evidence of things unseen :))

### 2023-04-17 18:16 - vowels as tones

I noticed that during [the explanation of the vowels](https://youtu.be/PGGKe3V3XYk?t=2853), I was reminded of "[the mithras liturgy](https://archive.org/details/mithrasliturgy0000unse)" where I was reading it and they have these vowel sequences that correspond to historical ray progressions in the incantation (that's a thing I can get into later) -- and so these sequences of tones correspond (in a greater sense) to passages of time (look on page 2). and there is (for bar, I'll use lowercase) AEeIOYo. that's our sequence there where A = 1 ... o = 7. I map these directy on to the rays, so then when later I look at the incantations, there are some progressions: "eY eIA Ee" (36 341 23), and then the second one "YeI AYI EYoYE" (634 124 26762). so there you can imagine an astral being (6) finding the symbolic through venus/ra (3) then down to saturn/spectral (4). followed by desire/chaos (1) then to big-picture/christ (2), then finally to saturn/spectral (4). the last one is big-picture/christ (2) to astral (6), down to physical/metric (7), then back up to astral (6), then back to big-picture/christ (2).
each of those tone sequences tells a story: the first is one that starts in astral and then does some shadow work (venus/hecate), before making it down to witchraft/saturn/satan.
the second is one that has powerful desire or chaos in their life (1), finds that desire to be found in christ (2), then ultimately finds theirself having been plugged into saturn/satan the whole time.
the third one starts out in christ perception (2), but that's too big and incomprehensible for actual daily life (like for example what does it *actually mean* to be a "christian" or to follow jesus the way he did), so you end up watcering down and living in astral/imagination/fantasy (6). that doesn't work out well at all either, so we've got to stick to physical facts, tangible things, etc. (7), but that's quite limited because just physical has a short/limited perception of time (or even the bigger picture and the evidence is saying there's much more), so then now back to dreaming of what all those things could mean again (6), and thmen finally finding that all things are expanding growing and changing in the big-picture again.

these vowel sequences tell of a temporal progression for the initiate and tune them to these experiences by using the voice to produce tones which resonate with those temporal sequence (obviously for theirself).

after that, I noticed that the way that multiple vowels are used in a word, have different rising and falling effects on my perception as I speak the word -- and those rising and falling sequences match tthe esoteric "character" of the word used in the greater metaphor of the speech.
