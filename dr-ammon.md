I came across his channel ([ladybabylon666](https://www.youtube.com/@ladybabylon666)) through [gnostic-informant](https://www.youtube.com/@GnosticInformant). I watched a few of the streams and commented some of my ideas in [my section on gnostic-informant](/gnostic-informant.md), howver, I feel like I've come to have enough ideas that I do want to dedicate a whole section here to some of my ideas. I may put some of the questions I have as well into his discord at a later point, but for now -- I just want to use this as a place for me to write out my most deranged ideas.

## questions
### 2023-04-17 16:17 - broad and narrow road
> are the broad and narrow road sexual organs?

it just seems that way... the broad road is the one that everyone travels on, but the narrow road seems a bit more youthful(?). the broad and wide gate is the one that everyone goes through and leads to destruction, but the narrow one, few people find.

### 2023-04-17 16:19 - the golden rule
> is "do to other men as you'd have them do to you" referring sexual positions?

it sure seems that way, but I don't know the ancient greek so I can't really comment on the verbs and how they're used.

## thoughts
### 2023-04-17 17:00 - eternal life

you said that eternal life is an absurdity and doesn't exist -- saying that it's ionic time/life instead, yet I do not think that's that's the case at all, because both are happening.

all energy/thought/perception/understanding (everything) is in movement, and so any "life" or energetic manifestation appears for an ion, and then transforms/transitions into another manifestation of (its own perception of) itself eternally; always, even the universe or the "all that is" God, satan, or whatever is always doing this.

the ion of ions is just the thing that came before the present ion -- or, said another way, it's the old preception that transformed into the new perception.

#### 2023-04-17 17:17 - everyone has eternal and ionic life

what the church is doing, is like selling icecubes to eskimos: you already have an abundance of the thing they're selling you. they're just exploiting ignorance by withholding knowlede; that's all.
almost certainly they know that every thing is constantly transforming into something greater than it previously was -- cause why else would they ban alchemy? alchemical principles show that eternal life and continuing expansion is a property of all forms of matter. so if an base substance can be turned into something greater without having to pay for it or earn it in some way, their entire sham falls apart.

### 2023-04-17 18:08 - if this is all about reason...

> if this is all about reason, then I should be able to prove the magic ([ref](https://youtu.be/PGGKe3V3XYk?t=2668))

have you ever been in a situation where someone who is a doubter wants you to perform something they don't believe in?
it's difficult, cause they don't have *faith* :)
