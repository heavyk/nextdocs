# kyle-notes

I keep having topics come to mind that feel like kyle. I don't really want to make a new section for the wide disparity of topics, so I'll just put them in here.

### 2022-12-24 18:36 - FMF as a picture of the earth and mars

in the sirian guide, they said that each one of the entities has a planetary component[^1]. therefore, all of the entites listed in the triads are supposedly in this solar system. looking at pluto, charon and the various sumerian myths, I figured that some of the moons may also be entites (yes, like ganymede), but also the possbility that anatau is inside of the earth. there are other various things of this goddess being birthed out of the forhead of zeus.

she's the dark goddess. the one of vileness and evil. she's a real problem. listening to jason, I get the sense that this 1st ray female that I feel inside of me is not the only me but a lot of others, too. my advantage is that I had a brain haemorrhage which gave me introspection capabilies, having the contrast between shut off brain and active brain (on my left side). exploring this right hemispere on lots and lots of drugs is basically where I discovered that I had this 1st ray inside of me. I wondered if it would be the same for the earth.

the earth I believe was pretty formless (dark) at the beginning, and so when enki arrived, he saw earth as a product of his desire. using megalithic architecture, he tuned earth to be the same as mars. it would contain all of the attributes of mars, looking feeling behaving all the same. well, mars is that 7th ray (physical, rocky) red planet we know and love. the earth appears to be the combination of the 1st ray dark goddess in the centre (she's an extremely compact black cube of ultra condensed hydrogen), and then the earth is that formless void that will appear as whatever is desired; anatau and genxicat -- and the 7th ray female is tuned to the frequency of mars (the planet and concept).

---

the first ray triad was anatau (anu/ninhursag) alalu and enki, and it sounds like alalu went his own way or was deposed by then, so it starts out with the concept created by alalu, and put into practise by enki the 3rd ray. he's the original titan that set everything into divine harmony and order. different triads pass through time, and it looks to me like the solar regimes were alalu at first, but my sense is that his ideas were too conceptual that they lacked physicality -- and so he didn't make a good enough (2nd ray is perspective of not-good-enoughness) "manual for how the universe works, solar edition" in a way which people could understand it. I believe enki could understand it though and he did his absolute best to make alalu's ideas work here on earth -- but he was fighting the demiurge army lead by enlil.

as a result, enki's solar regime was usurpped and overthrown a few times. notice how ra/zeus didn't really update a whole lot to the manual -- just kinda shuffled things arund and made a religion around it where he's king. in this regime osiris was the ground and he make ra's grandios new solar regime a reality. I don't really know what I see, because logically it seems strange -- oh, I get it. all of the solar regimes are all remixes of each other, so we're essentially simultaneously (because of our naive nature), in the regime of enki, saturn, and zeus at the same time.

I believe mythologies have been purposefully tampered with to say that it was zeus that usurped saturn's regime, and I can't really tell their difference a whole lot. it's possible they existed at the same time. either way, the saturnian regime is the atlantian one, and this is what made the 7th ray (aryan) triad important as the next big leap. notice though that the 7th ray triad didn't install a new solar regime. saturn's regime was very high minded, so it looks like he, being a 4th ray, perceives 5th and 3rd, he made his own 3rd ray regime. either way, the pissing contest over solar regimes is jason's atlantians vs olympians conflict which made the 7th ray triad so imortant. prometheus (alalu) is replaced by vulcan -- and as I've just recently found out, vulcan was zeus' primary cup-bearer, which means he basically built zeus' regime with a backdoor entrance installed.

I get a lot of reactions about my obsession with homosexuality -- and it's basically because the 2nd prometheus (ganymede), made everything go backwards. we experience reality in reverse from how zeus perceives it, so I think it's important to see things from vulcan's perspective[^2] (at least for me anyway).

the 7th ray triad, of mithras/mars, zarathustra/vulcan, and aphrodite/artemis/diana, makes it all possible from my perspective. they make the reverse possible. we can look from the bottom, up -- meanwhile in all of the solar regimes previous (including alalu), it was perceived from top, down.

I like to think of this as the redemption of alalu/prometheus because he found a way to look at the same thing from the 7th ray upward. I embody this, and it's encoded in all of us now (not just aryans). the only thing now is to make a new setup where the ground gets that perspective into reality. I thought about this for quite a while now and I haven't really figured it all out yet.

my current thinking is that there should be a 7th ray ground. the ground takes the energy of the emitter and makes it intelligible to those of his ray type. enki made 1st ray understandable to 3rd rays. it made for a perfect system, but it left a huge power vacuum, probably designed to attract zeus. zeus can understand the 1st ray perspective through enki, and getting that shapeshifting power of desire was pretty enticing to him[^3]. vulcan made that shapeshifting power possible for the 7th ray, by adjusting the female until she can shapeshift. all females, born since what 6kya or whatever have this quality (probably the origin of pandora -- as I bet every woman was a copy of hera). therefore, a female in modern times will contain more the perspective of the 7th ray (aphrodite) or the 5th ray (vulcan).

I have no idea, but whatever happened to me is that I somehow got/understood both the 7th and the 5th somehow. I'm not sure how honestly, but I believe it's a 2nd ray perspective that enables me to see it. I see everything as similar to everything else in some way *now*, but I got my start pointing out all of the things that were wrong and out of place (not dissimilar).

as a philosophical topic, there's quite a bit of difference between the concept of dissimilar and out of place/wrong. it's easier to see in the positive: there's quite a bit of difference beteen similar and right. similar isn't right. consider now the composition of the conceptual realm: things are attractied because of similarity, but they're ultimately accepted (like one of the receopors in your brain if it's "right"). rightness is a sort of vibrational compatibility that is not determined by frequency. this is your perception. this is you.

[1]: knowing the triads and their position in the solar system will yield much better astrology, no longer tied so much to the rotation of the earth.

[2]: there's a difference between a 3rd ray top and a 1st ray top. obviously, there's a difference between all of the perspectives; I'm illuminating the difference between mars (1st) and zeus (3rd) as encoded by vulcan.

[3]: I think that may be why so many of his legends are of shapeshifting to get away with rape or to sway some thing. then hera shows up, and she can shapeshift just like zeus and turns out to be kind of an asshole with that capability too.
