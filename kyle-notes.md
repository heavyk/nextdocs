# kyle-notes

I keep having topics come to mind that feel like kyle. I don't really want to make a new section for the wide disparity of topics, so I'll just put them in here.

### 2022-12-24 18:36 - FMF as a picture of the earth and mars

in the sirian guide, they said that each one of the entities has a planetary component[^1]. therefore, all of the entites listed in the triads are supposedly in this solar system. looking at pluto, charon and the various sumerian myths, I figured that some of the moons may also be entites (yes, like ganymede), but also the possbility that anatau is inside of the earth. there are other various things of this goddess being birthed out of the forhead of zeus.

she's the dark goddess. the one of vileness and evil. she's a real problem. listening to jason, I get the sense that this 1st ray female that I feel inside of me is not the only me but a lot of others, too. my advantage is that I had a brain haemorrhage which gave me introspection capabilies, having the contrast between shut off brain and active brain (on my left side). exploring this right hemispere on lots and lots of drugs is basically where I discovered that I had this 1st ray inside of me. I wondered if it would be the same for the earth.

the earth I believe was pretty formless (dark) at the beginning, and so when enki arrived, he saw earth as a product of his desire. using megalithic architecture, he tuned earth to be the same as mars. it would contain all of the attributes of mars, looking feeling behaving all the same. well, mars is that 7th ray (physical, rocky) red planet we know and love. the earth appears to be the combination of the 1st ray dark goddess in the centre (she's an extremely compact black cube of ultra condensed hydrogen), and then the earth is that formless void that will appear as whatever is desired; anatau and genxicat -- and the 7th ray female is tuned to the frequency of mars (the planet and concept).

---

the first ray triad was anatau (anu/ninhursag) alalu and enki, and it sounds like alalu went his own way or was deposed by then, so it starts out with the concept created by alalu, and put into practise by enki the 3rd ray. he's the original titan that set everything into divine harmony and order. different triads pass through time, and it looks to me like the solar regimes were alalu at first, but my sense is that his ideas were too conceptual that they lacked physicality -- and so he didn't make a good enough (2nd ray is perspective of not-good-enoughness) "manual for how the universe works, solar edition" in a way which people could understand it. I believe enki could understand it though and he did his absolute best to make alalu's ideas work here on earth -- but he was fighting the demiurge army lead by enlil.

as a result, enki's solar regime was usurpped and overthrown a few times. notice how ra/zeus didn't really update a whole lot to the manual -- just kinda shuffled things arund and made a religion around it where he's king. in this regime osiris was the ground and he make ra's grandios new solar regime a reality. I don't really know what I see, because logically it seems strange -- oh, I get it. all of the solar regimes are all remixes of each other, so we're essentially simultaneously (because of our naive nature), in the regime of enki, saturn, and zeus at the same time.

I believe mythologies have been purposefully tampered with to say that it was zeus that usurped saturn's regime, and I can't really tell their difference a whole lot. it's possible they existed at the same time. either way, the saturnian regime is the atlantian one, and this is what made the 7th ray (aryan) triad important as the next big leap. notice though that the 7th ray triad didn't install a new solar regime. saturn's regime was very high minded, so it looks like he, being a 4th ray, perceives 5th and 3rd, he made his own 3rd ray regime. either way, the pissing contest over solar regimes is jason's atlantians vs olympians conflict which made the 7th ray triad so imortant. prometheus (alalu) is replaced by vulcan -- and as I've just recently found out, vulcan was zeus' primary cup-bearer, which means he basically built zeus' regime with a backdoor entrance installed.

I get a lot of reactions about my obsession with homosexuality -- and it's basically because the 2nd prometheus (ganymede), made everything go backwards. we experience reality in reverse from how zeus perceives it, so I think it's important to see things from vulcan's perspective[^2] (at least for me anyway).

the 7th ray triad, of mithras/mars, zarathustra/vulcan, and aphrodite/artemis/diana, makes it all possible from my perspective. they make the reverse possible. we can look from the bottom, up -- meanwhile in all of the solar regimes previous (including alalu), it was perceived from top, down.

I like to think of this as the redemption of alalu/prometheus because he found a way to look at the same thing from the 7th ray upward. I embody this, and it's encoded in all of us now (not just aryans). the only thing now is to make a new setup where the ground gets that perspective into reality. I thought about this for quite a while now and I haven't really figured it all out yet.

my current thinking is that there should be a 7th ray ground. the ground takes the energy of the emitter and makes it intelligible to those of his ray type. enki made 1st ray understandable to 3rd rays. it made for a perfect system, but it left a huge power vacuum, probably designed to attract zeus. zeus can understand the 1st ray perspective through enki, and getting that shapeshifting power of desire was pretty enticing to him[^3]. vulcan made that shapeshifting power possible for the 7th ray, by adjusting the female until she can shapeshift. all females, born since what 6kya or whatever have this quality (probably the origin of pandora -- as I bet every woman was a copy of hera). therefore, a female in modern times will contain more the perspective of the 7th ray (aphrodite) or the 5th ray (vulcan).

I have no idea, but whatever happened to me is that I somehow got/understood both the 7th and the 5th somehow. I'm not sure how honestly, but I believe it's a 2nd ray perspective that enables me to see it. I see everything as similar to everything else in some way *now*, but I got my start pointing out all of the things that were wrong and out of place (not dissimilar).

as a philosophical topic, there's quite a bit of difference between the concept of dissimilar and out of place/wrong. it's easier to see in the positive: there's quite a bit of difference beteen similar and right. similar isn't right. consider now the composition of the conceptual realm: things are attractied because of similarity, but they're ultimately accepted (like one of the receopors in your brain if it's "right"). rightness is a sort of vibrational compatibility that is not determined by frequency. this is your perception. this is you.

[1]: knowing the triads and their position in the solar system will yield much better astrology, no longer tied so much to the rotation of the earth.

[2]: there's a difference between a 3rd ray top and a 1st ray top. obviously, there's a difference between all of the perspectives; I'm illuminating the difference between mars (1st) and zeus (3rd) as encoded by vulcan.

[3]: I think that may be why so many of his legends are of shapeshifting to get away with rape or to sway some thing. then hera shows up, and she can shapeshift just like zeus and turns out to be kind of an asshole with that capability too.

### 2022-12-24 21:43 - narrative and shepherding

the other day, I was writing about shepherding and how I don't like it because it feels like steering to me. just now, I was also thinking about how I write these ideas down -- as in they just come to me and I write them. it seems like maybe I'm not translating them just as how my feeders of information want me to write it. I also wrote about how I wasn't sure if shepherding is 2nd ray or 1st. after some thought, it's clearly 2nd ray -- but what showed up to me is how similar it is to narrative.

narrative, is a medium just like all of the others, cept the thing that transfers in the 2nd ray medium is the narrative, let's say. therefore, it's not so muchm what the narrative *is*, but that there is a narrative. nosebook is constantly steering and shepherding me to the concept that they think they want me to find.

in my opinion, nosebook would be pretty much the equivalent of zeus in technological form. nosebook is built literally on top of tesla technology (it's the world system made to run in their astral environment, not the suns). that's also interesting because tesla has all of vulcan's symbols (and I would also consider the second prometheus) -- cept a strange thing is that he's the tall aryan body and build (mars), not the lame zeus. considering that vulcan created technology for zeus, tesla and his gifting fields are the modern equivalent.

additionally, it's also helpful to note that when I was looking at the jupiter and saturn solar regimes, in mythologies it's said that saturn was first, but then zeus supplanted him, but this is opposite from the triads, where first is enki's (1st ray triad), then zeus (2nd ray triad), saturn is the 4th ray triad, and he would have come after zeus -- so I don't know why I felt like the saturnian and jupiterian regimes were concurrent. in the end, I think the difference is the moon (osiris). osiris and the pre-dynastic egyptians made the moon possible. this overthrew the martians (enlil's setup) in cairo and stuff, allowing jupiter/ra to rise to power.

so, when I think about why it's the saturnian (atlantian) regime, the reason why I think I feel it as concurrent is because of the moon. the moon and the various pyramids seem to set the "tone" of the planet. I believe we're running on the astral system of the moon (as seen during a solar eclipse), and also the megalithic structures, probably most built on enki's system. therefore, nosebook, truely is jupiter's (moon) system using and providing additional astral infrastructure to enki's system.

---

obviously, I want to create a new system. in this case, I'm the emitter here (1st ray), and so my system is all based on desire and LOA. I've basically started my manual from a 1st ray perspective. this implementation needs to be hung on a narrative.

if I just have materialistic science, this is the most lifeless explanation, and has no motivating factor. everything is a lifeless reaction, and there's nothing motivating all of this chaos -- just random collisions. what a 2nd ray sees is the motivating aspect, more than the reality (2nd ray perspective like to justify and stuff), and so this is your basic narrative structure. whether you have a mcguffin or whatever to move the thing forward, it is, in the end the story that moves the players from scene to scene.

---

now, here's the weird thing: I realised that the story doesn't matter. there are sad stories and there are happy stories, stories of accomplishment and failure. what matters is the medium which the story is told in. this is what we call "reality". we live a narrative reality, and that narrative reality is our own creation.

another way to look at it is, that it doesn't matter who writes the narrative. zeus himself could be writing my narrative for me, like I'm one of his play-thing dolls, and it still doesn't matter because it's not the exact narrative that makes anything. all vibrations flow through the manual and get turned into perceivable reality for us.

remember how my system/manual is based on desire and LOA? well, that's exactly it. in my system you attract things perceptually through the use of symbols.

I noticed one of the reactions I get frequently is that "I see whatever I want" -- which is accurate -- cept, I'd say I see it as a reflection of my perception and/or how I conceptualise the universe.

the way that I do that is one of an entitled brat. I see narrative elements around me (like shows on TV, stories, myths, etc.) and the elements that I like, I feel association with, and so the symbols that my associated character receives in response to their actions, I begin to think of myself that this can happen this same way. those are the legends that I inspire myself to. I like to take those symbols, rearrange them, manipulate them, and find a way for them to conform to my desire. I embody that 1st ray female.

the 1st ray female (anatau, not genxicat/aphrodite/ishtar) doesn't care what it takes to get the thing done. she just wants something and violence, warfare, etc are equally valid in her box of tricks. here's how it happens (I'll explain from my perspective). I want to force a change in regime in some place, so I've seen before in my past that all elections have a dialectic, and both sides are saying roughly the same thing, but their approach angle is different, so you pick the thing that you want (desire) and then just make two "opposite" sides that take different angles of approach to the same thing.

this way of looking at things, seeing the desire and the requisite elements to arrive to the desire is the perspective of desire. at the end of every desire is a destiny; it's like a destination and you do eventually get there. allong the way is the aarrative elements that "get you ready" for the destiny. this is how reality works for me anyway.

seeing the 1st ray system displayed so plainly, it should be easy to see now how that is zeus' same system, but perceived from the ground up. in his 3rd ray system, he needs to manipulate physical and conditions (3-7) to get his desire to take place. this new 1st ray system, doesn't need any such conditions for something to happen -- all it needs is a way to get there -- and quite literally all narratives arrive to the same destiny; so, like choose the path you want to go, you know.

### 2022-12-25 12:42 - destiny and fate

in lbe there was a constant struggle for enki between what is destiny and what is fate. the basic sense that I got from him, is that destiny is unavoidable, and seems to repeat based on a symbolic pattern and has some sort of narrative qualities. destiny can be understood much easier if we think of destiny as destination. you will arrive to it unavoidably, and along the way there are repiticious symbols.

remember when I looked into how reality was different back then compared to now? I could see how reality, in a sense had to *prove* itself to the observer. at that time, I think reality was a bit more dream-like and things could move around a little easier, so it was important, like in a dream to make sense of reality symbolically. I think probably an easy way to conceptualise this would be to swap dream and waking realities. lifting giant rocks would be a lot easier in dreams, so long as you believe you can do it. in the dream state (for them), reality was more action/reaction based, and so this is where the messengers and other things which are a reaction to your emotional state (like reality for us) show up.

if I think of waking reality as a mix of 5th and 7th (which it is from my perspective), then dream reality is a mix of 1st and 3rd. their realities were swapped from how they are now. I think this swap happened with the aryan mutation, so it's only relatively recent. up until then, reality has been perceived from the top down -- a product of the symbols. however, since zeus has turned the 3rd ray perspective of reality into a clown show (and thanks to the updates of vulcan), we now perceive from the bottom (5th) up.

like I mentioned, vulcan left a backdoor in his manual, which is that the 3rd ray can be perceived pretty easily from the 5th ray. for an example of this, I demonstrate it all the time. what vulcan did is very important, because the 5th ray is partially perceived in the astral. just like the 2nd ray is a mix of 1st and 3rd (the "reality" that enki lived in), so is the astral a mix of the conceptual and also the physical. you see the image, but it also causes you to *feel* something as well. it's that *feeling*, emotion, or concept that allows you to access vulcan's backdoor into zeus' system.

geting people to practise feeling emotions and concepts in their imagination is a pretty good "trick" if you ask me. it's a bit of a slight of hand, because the really pretty image keeps your attention (focused) and while you're manipulating the picture around, you're really teaching yourself to feel the emotion (which shows up as a picture) the way you want it to feel (so the picture looks how you want it). vulcan was a very tricky guy; definitely a trickster[^1].

---

there's this problem that enki has in lbe which is that he feels like he's lost the ability to perform his desire symbolically and get the result he's looking for. I'm looking at lbe's being written after the moon's arrival and atlantian collapse -- so likely the reason why he can't get all the symbols to work out properly is because of the moon's effect and also ra/zeus' rerrangement of the symbols (for his glory).

to illustrate this, let's have a look at ishtar. she's a 7th ray female and she can use her physical appearance to get (especially the boys), to produce emotion and desire in them -- which then becomes a reality. her effect of manipulating emotion and desire is just like ninhursag/anatau, but instead of just wanting it and getting it, she performs physical things (sex, illusions, etc) to get what she wants. she's pretty similar to zeus, yeah -- but the point is, she has to put work and effort into getting what she wants.

reality is now backwards for enki; physical symbolic acts can produce a reality, instead of it being like how it used to be where the symbols produced reality directly like in a lucid dream[^2].

vulcan's reality where emotions now produce the destiny, rathar than symbols -- is a complete reversal from how they are. now I see round two ofo zeus accepts ishtar's way of now using physical conditions and symbols to produce reality and this became the egyptian mystery religions. zeus (take two) is still trying to convince us that we need to manipulate physical conditions to get the reality we want, meanwhile hera is telling us that we can manpulate it from an emotional/conceptual/narrative perspective.

narration is the motivation, and the emotions/concepts are the things that we acquire along the way in the story. now I can see that hera did to narration what zeus did to ceremonial order and religion. her original form of narration measures the characters by their fortune, deeds, and actions in a symbolic fashion. therefore, we associate all of the measurements (and their contests) with physical things, when in reality, you don't accomplish the goal of the narrative (measure up), until you've grasped the concept and made it a part of you (character development).

character development is one of the most important thing in a story. if you don't evolve your characters, the story feels very flat. I propose that in addition to physical measurements we're measured by concepts and emotions as well.

as an example, the part where princess bride takes off her glasses and gets a tiny makeover, is the physical measurement -- but when perceived as destiny, she'll keep repeating the same story (needing similar physical conditions) until she figures out that her body is a reflection of her percption. she felt frumpy at the beginning, and then a physical condition came along and it caused her to feel better about herself -- and that is *really* why she got more beautiful, not the makeover. it's her destiny to be beautiful, just cause she is. she doesn't need physical conditions. meanwhile, she does, she'll fall to the same fate over and over failing to ever remake herself from the inside out.

[1]: finding out abut queen hera *really* opened my eyes because I realised his style of trickery is exemplified in queen hera. he's behaving like the desire role, but in physical. she has ideas of what she wants, so while zeus is out manipulating physical conditions to get his desire, hera is manipulating things in a conceptual/emotional way to get what *she* wants. she feels superior to zeus, which is why zeus is so scared of her all the time foiling his plans.

[2]: this just gave me a really interesting idea. nosebook prevents me from lucid dreaming, but if I could I'd try this: when becoming lucid, instead of trying to manipulate reality physically (can't cause it's a vapour), try to perceive symbols in more and more pure form until the vapour reality conforms to the symbols. for me, the symbols are pure so they're not visible in any way for me, and they sort of superimpose over the image, becoming it's sort of structure. the way I accomplish this, is because the vapour reality is still formless. so, for example, if I try and perceive the symbol as being "behind" or "underneith" the image, I would perceive the depth of the image, not the symbol. to see this picture, the picture can't have depth, cause that'll cause you to see the image instead of the symbol. as such, the image just passes in front of my eyes like while in sleep. I don't move around in space, but instead see the symbols changing, and then reality follows (the symbols look like paths to me, so there is definitely a structure to the symbols). when I wrote that I understood the dream state from enki's perspective[^3], and it serves as starting point for what will become the 2nd ray perspective. I already see it coming. it's my destiny. try doing that style of lucid dreaming as I develop it. I'm sure it'll illuminate a lot of new things for you.

[3]: telling you dude, I think he's alive and he's definitely aware of me writing this

### FFF triad and the difference between an emitter and female
