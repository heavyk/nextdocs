I've been writing a lot more about music and sound and I need a place to put the ideas...

### 2022-10-27 14:42 - vulnerability

a few days ago I wrote about BTS and how they took their struggle for acceptance, vulnerability, and being successful and turned it into music. well, today I noticed something. I watch these girls do their dancing and DJ thing and I watch it, but I don't really feel any condemnation. I noticed that today, they might feel all three of those things when I watch them.

when I'm watching them, I'm figuring different thinkgs about how their processes work and how they make creative decisions and stuff. my effort to figure them out, probably feels like vulnerability. next, I'm watching everything they do and how they move and things too, which means that surely, if I'm watching them so carefully, I *must* have an opinion on their performance, and this touches the other two points.

if I accept them, then their performance was good enough at least (acceptable), but if I don't, that's bad. for the being successful one, that is also acceptance, but with a different layer on top. a person may be acceptable when they do something well, and that should make them successful, but if I'm jealous of the other person, then I don't want them to be successful. the corollary of that is that if I see someone else being successful, I'm less likely to accept them because I'm jealous of them. therefore, it's "being successful [and also accepted by others]".

now to give some light on this issue, imagine for a moment that my perspective is of a 1st ray. I desire to pick them apart and figure them out -- not so that I can take advantage of them, but because I'm generally interested because I too learn a lot through them, and I find it very fascinating stuff. I suppose the possibility that I could use the informatcion that I'm picking up by watching them as something I could use to hurt them, but I imagine that seems somewhat far-fetched or unrealistic. it could be perceived as vulnerability, but it's probably not because I'm not that interested in my own success. I already feel myself to be successful (successful is a form of perception, but we think of it mostly as a condition) so I'm not really a perceived threat. that makes my life easier, and that perception of success is actually what has made me more successful that anything else (even though I don't really have so many successful conditions to prove my success). I don't compete with them.

so, what we're really looking at with those 3 subjects are actually things of competition.

a 7th ray takes the essence (concept, consciousness) of something (like a song, or the feeling a song makes) and tries to provide a suitable/acceptable physical form (art, sound, light, etc) in whith that essence can be expressed in its broadest or narrowest sense. when you think of marketing, this process of constraining an idea to a physical what the marketing department does into words and pictures; they take an idea and find words and images to focus that essence into a form which is desirable (I just described 2nd ray's interaction with desire to explain the imagination's interaction with the physical, which is the function of the 7th ray). once that idea takes on a communicable or physical form, it begins to have the effects that the original product was designed to do.

in a sense, that's kind of what I'm doing. I'm collecting a lot of data and trying to figure out a form which more adquiately (acceptably) transmits/expresses the concept that they're conveying.

so, if I had to say anything to BTS about those words, I would say that they have the 7th ray perspective and it looks like their process was to take the 1st ray persspective and apply it to their music. nice.

### 2022-10-27 18:08 - potential structure for a song

as I was listening to the song I was wondering what the song would sound like if I took each of those intro segments and shortened them all down to be a few measures long, so it sounds a bit to me like an accelerating car accident or something slightly chaotic that's beginning to come to rest -- then I took one of the beats that she has and continued that on for a longer time to give it some emphasis.

the important thing to note is that this song structure is for ADD kids. each segment is never more than a few seconds long to keep their attention, then when it's kinda starting to accelerate out of control, a constant beat comes in and stays for 20-30 measures -- but, only for as long as you think you can keep their attention, then make another transition (the long ones) -- then after it's done, save it and chop that one up into a few measures each segment in the transition, and repeat.

it feels to me like a song that perpetually goes from a kind of chaos to a bit of order, then transitions again (chaos), then back to order... it's a cycle going from chaos to order and back by removing most of the buildup thansitions making them feel like a chaos building to something more.

I was thinking about how this would sound if I were to remix some of the old songs with this style, extending some parts and reducing others. it's kinda a bit like what the radio does.

anyway, the other thing I was thinking about is that this style of song creation could be a part of the song format itself, so that you could have the player determine how they want the transitions to be. the song knows where the meat is and where all the sides are so it can kinda adjust the play style of the song to fit the listener's preference.
