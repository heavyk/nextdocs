I've been writing a lot more about music and sound and I need a place to put the ideas...

### 2022-10-27 14:42 - vulnerability

a few days ago I wrote about BTS and how they took their struggle for acceptance, vulnerability, and being successful and turned it into music. well, today I noticed something. I watch these girls do their dancing and DJ thing and I watch it, but I don't really feel any condemnation. I noticed that today, they might feel all three of those things when I watch them.

when I'm watching them, I'm figuring different thinkgs about how their processes work and how they make creative decisions and stuff. my effort to figure them out, probably feels like vulnerability. next, I'm watching everything they do and how they move and things too, which means that surely, if I'm watching them so carefully, I *must* have an opinion on their performance, and this touches the other two points.

if I accept them, then their performance was good enough at least (acceptable), but if I don't, that's bad. for the being successful one, that is also acceptance, but with a different layer on top. a person may be acceptable when they do something well, and that should make them successful, but if I'm jealous of the other person, then I don't want them to be successful. the corollary of that is that if I see someone else being successful, I'm less likely to accept them because I'm jealous of them. therefore, it's "being successful [and also accepted by others]".

now to give some light on this issue, imagine for a moment that my perspective is of a 1st ray. I desire to pick them apart and figure them out -- not so that I can take advantage of them, but because I'm generally interested because I too learn a lot through them, and I find it very fascinating stuff. I suppose the possibility that I could use the informatcion that I'm picking up by watching them as something I could use to hurt them, but I imagine that seems somewhat far-fetched or unrealistic. it could be perceived as vulnerability, but it's probably not because I'm not that interested in my own success. I already feel myself to be successful (successful is a form of perception, but we think of it mostly as a condition) so I'm not really a perceived threat. that makes my life easier, and that perception of success is actually what has made me more successful that anything else (even though I don't really have so many successful conditions to prove my success). I don't compete with them.

so, what we're really looking at with those 3 subjects are actually things of competition.

a 7th ray takes the essence (concept, consciousness) of something (like a song, or the feeling a song makes) and tries to provide a suitable/acceptable physical form (art, sound, light, etc) in whith that essence can be expressed in its broadest or narrowest sense. when you think of marketing, this process of constraining an idea to a physical what the marketing department does into words and pictures; they take an idea and find words and images to focus that essence into a form which is desirable (I just described 2nd ray's interaction with desire to explain the imagination's interaction with the physical, which is the function of the 7th ray). once that idea takes on a communicable or physical form, it begins to have the effects that the original product was designed to do.

in a sense, that's kind of what I'm doing. I'm collecting a lot of data and trying to figure out a form which more adquiately (acceptably) transmits/expresses the concept that they're conveying.

so, if I had to say anything to BTS about those words, I would say that they have the 7th ray perspective and it looks like their process was to take the 1st ray persspective and apply it to their music. nice.
