in context with what I've been talking about with the lyra thing, I started to piece together the puzzle a bit:

first, I noticed that the stargazer is probably me -- but it's perceived within the conceptual/cultural framework of the 70s, so the same concepts that I'm writing now, and seem fine to us in this framework, would, in the 70s (or whatever), those concepts are being looked at very very differently (with much more fear and stuff).

the important thing to note is that I'm like a machine in how I view things. some things are more performant than others, so to me, the symbols which represent something are either performant (in the way that I want), or they're not; no other options (unless I'm looking from a social perspective). so, you could imagine living in a dream world (lyra) where everything that's happening to physical kenny is happening over there with the symbols I perceive over there, so I'm talking interacting (and everything) with other people as if they were in my dreams. in fact, there, there isn't any physicality, so all is astral/imaginal. I don't see that imaginal world, so the symbols that I perceive and project on to others (in the other world) produces a very different result, than it does here, where we see the *physical* and not the imaginal version of them.

therefore, there (home) is a pretty fun place to be with ariel, because you are how I see you to be, not how *you* see yourself to be. therefore, you, as well as I would be perfectt there. it's a nice place to be where you're isolated in these little islands where you interact with entirely the conjuration of that concept.

so, for example, when a war in physical happens, the player here loses their *physical* life, but the player there just falls over, then gets taken off of their mental stage. I imagine it like a bunch of boys LARPing. I remember doing that as a kid with justin and stuff, right, and even the worst tragedies are not really a big deal, cause you're just play dying and its not *really* blood either.
