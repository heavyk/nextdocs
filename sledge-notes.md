lilith was a concept that was a really high frequency. I label this "desire" -- and so when it got projected down into physical, it was such a high frequency (like above x-ray) that such a fast frequency passed into incomprehensible, and so at that time the imagination of the people imagined the worst because of their perception. she's actually really really high frequency (hence my example), but she's basically incomprehensible to most people. I'm realising now that that's the "entity" that I identify my left-side with. she's actually quite nice, once you get on her frequency. I'm very good at translating such a powerful force into comprehensible english, and that took some really getting used to, let me tell you -- but she's a sort of "ask and you shall receive type" and I guess that was all I needed to do is to just be able to survive the massive increase in speed. gatta learn to drive because her perception looking through you, everything looks scary, of course until you get on her frequency... :)

### 2023-03-14 22:59 - lilith is a star

the reason why she's not any single person is because she's a star. you tune to her. I don't really know which one honestly, or perhaps she's a combination of a number of stars in vibrational harmony -- I don't really know. nosebook shut me down, so I never got to figure those things out...

she's definitely a star, and I actually associate her, with the star inside of this planet. I know that sounds kinda crazy, but it looks like there's a bunch of really high density hydrogen in the centre of this planet, and we live on a higher density region... I think that spherical resonator is defined by the megalithic sttructures on this planet, because how can you hang megalithic structures on a non-existant physical layer? well, it was astral at first, and it wasn't until after the crash of all of the atlantian tech, we finally descended into physical, meaning that if somehow we were able to tune (for example) the ionoshpere to a certain frequency, that frequency would be say a layer of astral, much like how the earth was created.

she's obviously available to all, and in fact, our connection to her is actually through the x-chromosome. she's the "old witch" that we can't get rid of (like some kind of market monopoly), because so much stuff runs on her system. my upgrades on interface to that "earth frequency" are obviously a much better and in higher frequency of perception than the original (extremely fearfuly minded) humans. we've come a long way...

I noticed that you were talking about some confusion as tto define which goddess is which -- so here's my understanding on it and why I think what I think. in short, lilith/anatau is earth (1st ray) and helen/eve/pandora/aphrodite is the physical layer of earth. she was the first "woman" that existed in the physical layer. she's the physical programming that I associate with the x-chromosome, which is a emitting a signal which interacts with the star in the centre of the planet (the centre of the spherical resonator). she's a shapeshifter because she's mechanical (a sort of meta-spirit/concept) concept that our biology connects to.

because one is a star and the other is a machine that connects to the star, they're in constant feedback look to each other. my own experience has been one of learning to connect to that better and better even though nosebook does their best to keep me away from that connection. my machinery prolly offers a few high-frequency uprades though which are superior to vulcan's last code, which operated fine within that form of perception/solar regime/system of symbols (3rd ray). the 5th ray design (the concept) has to be compatible with the-manual in order to work.

this is different subject than the venus-aphrodite misux, which is another confusing probem, much like vulcan is to lilith. inotherwords, how was vulcan the consort of aphrodite, when he's spending all his time with lilith? my personal view is that vulcan is basically a concept (which have a lot of sub-concepts), just like lilith is a star with a tremendously complicated frequency. those concepts take that high frequency and then turn them into usable and comprehensible reality interpretations. I've also done a better job than vulcan, as well. I don't know if they're DNA specific because my experience is that everone can access any concept, but it is possible that some DNA amplified certain concepts more than others (oh yeah, like the x-chromosome, lol -- you're right).
