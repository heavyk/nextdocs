a mobile app. you bring it up, and it has a few boxes:

[ 5m  ]
[ 10m ]
[ 15m ]
[ 20m ]
[ 30m ]
[ 40m ]
[ 1h ]
[ 2h ]
[ 4h ]

OK, so it's a heraldry app where all tthe time the symbolism is changing, and all it is, is a symbolism app, where people share and display symbolic images that they've collected. that's one option.
after that, what the app is doing for you is it's finding you something interesting to you related to the *games* (complexity adjustted for ttime selected) and so what you als odo is you put a bunch of heraldric symbols in there, so that evidence of a certain symbol has appeared here.
or, say for example you want to get your time selected's worth of interesting articles: *news*. the joke here is that the lowest time is the shittier article; if they wanna be prepared to be there, say for 4h or more to get a really good one.
after that, there is of course also going to be featuring new other categories of essentially *games* that you play with on your phone -- they function kind of like micro-apps where you can just let the creator of the category put in the content that they want there in that category. OK, then I can get more new kinds of micro-apps selected, essentially creating a new diversity space of their own. that's cool, I know.
I would also want to eventually build up a new -- these things are all going to connected to data and stuff, so really the data for this app will be sourced by "trustable" resources; know what I mean? so then, you (I mean, I) can now imagine mirco-apps that all have a data structure of some kind, which relates to these symbol's way, as related to the micro-app (concept). so I can now look at it as a concept: a concept is a vibration or identity of some sort. few identities will be pure, and the purer the concept, the less desirable, it was. this is kinda how sex works, right. the thing is, -- hang on.
what will eventually emerge from such a system, is a cohesive way to interact with each other, because each one of these (concepts) are just a view into this symbolic system of data; the medium *is*; the message.
    OH, so you're referring to me in as relating to girls sexually tthat have a lot of attraction. though, that's a property of nature, I don't perceive it like that at all. though, I find them higly attractive, they are only attractive at a distance until they get tto close. I've typically just been one of those guys that typically doesn't want to feel the way that they do. I'm *far* more attracted to all the other ones, and that's even feeling all that much attraction toward them. I'm *sorta* "scared" more than anything -- a sort of terror that happens if you try and go too fast toward something unwanted. that's easily solved by feeling the way I want to feel. anyway, the unwanted only happens when she (I mean, anything) would disturb my trajectory too much. I attract wanted, so I don't have to worry too much about that. I know there are ohters more aware of how "stable" I am. I have no clue, cause I just go toward wanted, all of that is completely off my radar. my point is this: I'm already *far* "worse" on myself than she would be, so anyone that matched me would be going as fast as I am. it'll happen eventually. remember, there will eventually be people with more contrast now, going faster than me, eventually "kill" me by going faster than I. so I could imagine that I would have to continue to go for as much contrast as possible to keep up.
you see, there's thiss thing that really keeps you up, and  that is that I's just feeling the way I want to feel, because all of you symbolic guys out there (venus-in-disguise) are just looking for whatever you wantto see. we do this in each other all the time, and those foolish identity with our symbolic version of another person, is different than I think them to bwe. think of this now from the perspective of attraction. I see them as a thing, and if the thing is not something I want to feel like, I just doge. you know it's just like -- well, I learned it from rupert, who manages to wiggle himself out of a bad-feeling situation with ease. know what I mean? it's easy to see how he did it for me, which is just relating a bad feeling to an alarm, and then when the alarm goes off, jusxt sorta peace out of there. not worth the conflict. it's just like bad vibes, right? -- interesting.

OK, so the reason why this app is important is because it's a great way to introduce symbols into the system. I've learned a lot from the "Lilluminati" in the sense that these are just reflective beings, and so if you wanted to perform a symbolic act on history, you put out your symbols ahead of time. you embed them into the "psyche" of the perceivers of those symbols, much like how a play does on a person, and so we can now think of these symbols, now as interactive symbols, where a symbol is represented or instantiated into multi-symbol-concepts. I mean from a database structure perspective, each concept contains many symbols, so the relation is many-to-one. in the endd, we can see these symbols as transforming and moving. a sort of "director's seat" of symbols appearance in-time (check other timeline I watched [cameron's video on directing](https://youtu.be/qTVGXcmk0xg) cause if you get enough people to believe in something, you can make it happen).
at any rate, the way I want to look into the world is probably "ahead of it's time" though, so I probably won't even try to do something like that. my *only* job is to feel good, and ultimately the way many of us feel will begin to differ greatly between us, and the grave news is that I learned the other day (from a reputable source: shakespere and steiner, and mckenna) that eclipeses are a way to create timelines that sorta branch off from the one that I'm on.
what I determined is that, because I don't have any "pinecone" in my head, because I surgically I had my "angel seat" organ removed. therefore, I am *permanently* in the physical world. during eclipeses, and we have a multi-year eclipse coming soon if that's what it's decided to put our relation to the sun. I have no idea, but it's probably all figured out -- and what'll happen is we'll branch off to multiple timelines: the physical (for which I'm physically retained, because of this body); and, the astral. I really like the idea of remaining in physical. I made the choice to be here. you know that physical eyes can also see at very high frequency. I don't need to have vision inside of my head and my aura around me, in order to see with my eyes.
so anyway, we'll be dividing inthe not to distant future. it's totally fine, cool and all I can say is: don't worry. you have a very stable guy you're relying upon. I've come a long way, and I don't really I don't really mind the concept of building a whole nother reality upon my perception, and I am a bit of an egoist, but I think it''l be fine. trust me ~)
lol.
