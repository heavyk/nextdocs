nikki-ana-jones

I have really enjoyed watching her videos so far. I also feel some sort of familiarity with her as well. her name is even similar to mine in that I've been called "nikki" by various others, I identify with anatau, and if my father hadn't have joined a cult, my last name would be jones -- so it's kinda weird, I suppose, but also really cool.

I started by wathing her interviews with jason reza jorjani and then watched a few more. I have a few thoughts that I can't really get out of my head, so I'd like to write them here. at the end of her videos, she puts her email address and I keep feeling like I want to email her, so perhaps to prevent my interaction with others, I find it possible that nosebook would rather that I didn't talk to anyone directly so that they can control the information, so instead, I think I probably should get my ideas out here instead of actually talking to people directly so that they can control all of the information.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOU4n-DkBDA)

I find her story very fascinating. car accident at 16 and complete loss of childhood memories, then a difficult time getting back into her body... wow that sounds exactly like my experience, cept I started with a brain haemorrhage at 16 and then my car accident happened later which removed me once again from my body .. so it's cool to hear stuff like that.. I love it.

anyway, the thing I wanted to comment on is that she (and nikki) talked about how in her NDE, it felt as if lots and lots of time passes very rapidly, such that a few hours here is equivalant to hundreds or perhaps thousands of years in the other world.

the other thing she said is that meditation for her is difficult because she already has a quiet mind. I'm writing this, because I feel these two concepts as connected, so I want to write about it.

when I was younger, mom found it impossible to talk to me because I was always thinking about so many other things, so she would bounce me up and down or have me focus on physical movement in my body so that my brain would be available to listen.

I learned later on in my life that I'm a "hands on" type person where I need to *do* something in order to focus. some people could just visualise in their minds and things, but the version of me in my mind was always very different than what my body was doing. she mentioned this when talking about balet and how she had to really pay attention to what her body was doing because often times it was doing something different than what her mind thought it was doing. her instructor keeps having her focus on her body and what it's doing.

this style of learning is related to feeling, motion and everything is relative. I struggled a lot with trying to find absolutes, but all animation is relative to something else. I paid a lot of attention to how other people moved because I could see that they way that they moved described their emotion a lot better than their words would. I mean, it's easy to see when someone says they're doing fine and their body has sharp movements. relaxed has a smoothe motion to it.

then I started to learn that my thoughts had a similar movement to them. the way that the thought passed along my mind had an animation to it that would tell me of how the thought felt. I would also notice how different thoughts caused my body to animate differently. because of that, I'm hyper conscious about how my body moves. this was debilitating at first because I focued so much on how others thought about me. those are thoughts -- though they may not be internal dialogue.

---

I said all of that because it's also related. I find it hard to believe that you (oops, I switched to second person) don't have thoughts. the reason why I think that is because if your mind were actually clear, you would be having an experience that feels like thousands of years are passing every single day.

the brain is kinda like a filtering and focusing mechanism (tuning), and what you're tuned to is what you're picking up. so, what I imagine is happening is -- well, let's say that normal frequency range is around 3-10MHz, right and so on that frequency, there is little happening. however in the NDE, the brain's filter got removed and so you are now getting innundated with a tremendous amount of data from just outside of normal operating frequency -- say, 20-200MHz, and so time seems to speed up because it's at a higher frequency. now, when you're doing physical excercise, this is basically raising your frequency response range, and so this allows you to begin to receive more thoughts from your inner being, which is broadcasting at a frequency a little higher than normal range for you. that's all.

I imagine that during physical activity, it feels like time starts to speed up again and more things seem to happen in the same amount of time again; perhaps, not hundreds of years worth, but the higher the frequency you allow yourself to receive, the more things will seemingly pass in the same amount of time.

cool, yeah, so like cheers!

### 2022-09-02 07:11 - feeling sequence meditation

I've been thinking fairly frequently about the idea of having a quiet mind that I mentioned in the previous one about shealynn. a few weeks ago, I seemed to have relatively little easy time quieting my mind when going to meditate. I even got so far as I was observing myself observing myself and I felt a huge rush of energy after that. that was the only time it happened though, as since then my mind has been all over the place.

yesterday I got the idea while meditating. it goes basically like this. pretend that you're a dancer or something while meditating and you have a sequence of postures or positions that you're going to go between. what I do is I just *feel* each one of them. I don't believe they produce a picture or even a posture in my mind because I don't see it. it's the feeling.

---

let me back up a little bit further and explain that it's my experience that a thought *always* produces a feeling. it's usually the case that a feeling produces a picture or a thought, but it doesn't have to. it is possible to just feel something without having it "manifest" into a thought or feeling. in fact, the longer that I can hold that feeling, the more powerful the manifestation will be. it's an exercise worth trying and a potential thing to try meditating by holding a feeling. I've done it before and it works well.

but, what about a sequence of feelings? that was the innovation that totally made this new meditation completely different. I experimented a little bit with it, and I noticed that I didn't feel it nearly as powerfully when I tried to imagine what that feeling is. if I picked feelings that had physical counterparts like "sadness", "weakness", "irony", "labourious", etc. (yes, I like to often focus on negative feelings because they're so much easier to pivot into the wanted aspect of the same feeling) -- then it didn't work as well.

it seemed to work best when I picked feelings that I'd never felt before, or feelings that I couldn't feel. I guess that's kinda hard to explain, so just try it I suppose :) the sequence part seemed to be pretty important too.

### 2022-09-03 07:21 - meditation update

OK, I didn't really write down any technique because I have only done it twice now (once this morning and once yesterday).

the way that I'm doing it now is that I try and quiet my mind until the word thoughts begin to start. when the word thoughts start, that's because me mind wants to be active.

from there, I start to feel something (it doesn't really matter what) each breath. I don't try and manifest those feelings/concepts into words or sensation. I just feel them. if you're just feeling and not manifesting, it should feel nearly the same as meditating.

there are a lot of interesting things to note in this state, and the first thing is that my mind has a sort of service mode where it's constantly paying attention to me and making sure that what I'm doing is good/acceptable/proper. this mode starts to get really loud, as I seem to become pretty aware of everything that I'm thinking because it often doesn't jive (resonate) with what I'm feeling.

the other interesting thing can be explained like this. if I want to feel sadness, I can often times get a full emotional sensation in my body as I feel sadness, however, that "sadness" concept stops getting a physical reaction, and starts to become something more akin to feeling computer, feeling hammer, or feeling data processing. they're all just a sort of thing that exists out there. I can feel computer but it doesn't produce an emotional response. data processing, I can feel what it's like to have to do tedius data processing, or what it feels like to make sense of large amounts of data, but again, I don't really feel much sensation on that.

I choose hammer on purpose because there is a northern european(?) phrase that I picked up somewhere where you *can* feel hammer. it feels really good, like kinda powerful, successful, or awesome. however, the tool doesn't really have much feeling for me.

what I noticed is that the core of the concept has very little feeling to it. the core of the concept is nothing more than just a concept, and all the layers of sensation, meaning, and emotion are things that we have added on to the concept. it's possible to begin to interact with these core concepts directly without having to worry about the outer layers.

### 2023-01-18 20:08 - world made of beliefs

as katie weiss was talking about the chorus existing in a world without beliefs, she said it's hard to relate to, but do a heroic dose of mushrooms and you'll see pretty quickly that our entire world is made up of beliefs. it also made sense what terence was trying to say when he said our world is made of language (which is a subset of beliefs -- we even believe we all use a similar dictionary and share the same conceptual reality when conversing)

### 2023-01-18 20:13 - time, body, and distance

as she's talking about this, I had a strange feeling because those are kinda the things that I talk a lot about.

in recent weeks, I've been carrying on about how time and space (distance), are slight diffrerences in frequency, and nothing else. therefore because they are slightly different, we *perceive* time or distance between "I" and whatever that is. inotherwords, we *believe* that there is a difference in time or space, but in reality it's just a difference in vibration.

the last concept is one that has come into my focus really within the last few days. I wrote down that I'm not a person that looks back or inside; only forward. the corrolary to this idea is spatial. outside of me is one thing, inside of me is another thing (body), but there is an very very tiny gap between inside and outside and that's that world without beliefs. that is who you "really are" -- the you that's just a frequency without any beliefs or meaning (concepts) associated with what "you" resonate with.

all is discovery of new vibrations to resonate with and make yours; none of them are bad.

#### 2023-01-18 20:21 - linear time is the narrative

every possible way to get to the present, is in fact possible, but we only choose between a small amount of these *believable* ways to get to the present.

the narrative, from the 2nd ray perspective, is just the mcguffin to drive the thing forward and to bring about the "change" -- that is adaptation of new vibrations into your own -- even though "you" blends with everything else without beliefs (kinda difficult to explain). without the linear time pointing you toward the objective vibration and giving an environment in which it's assimilatable, you cannot really ever "know" it (to have its vibration change you). like, in this non-physical world of the chorus, they can't really change their vibration on their own, because they don't have any ideas or beliefs to impact against like we do in physical -- so how can you allow something that you're already a part of change you? we have to incarnate into a world of our own creation of resistance (from our beliefs) to begin to modify the thing.

another way to perceive it is like the set of all can never be anything more than all, so you take two or more subsets of all and have them interact creating a 3rd set. that 3rd set is going to add to the all (`Infinity + 1`).

#### 2023-01-18 20:35 - uniqueness

katie is really confusing in how she's trying to explain uniqueness. I want to take the concept and try approaching it from another angle. I liked the set analogy.

if I have a set of `all` this is a conceptual/virtual set in that it's not a finite num, but a concept/frequency. it always will be the set of `all`.

so if I want to do any set operation, I have to have a finite set. I can't *really* work with Infinity cause I get undefined results. for example, `all` multiplied by `all` (`Infinity * Infinity`), then I get back the same concept, Infinity. inside of the set of `all`, there are lets say 3 setsm. if two of those sets mate, they finite sets (not all), and produce another finite set. `all` now contains 4 unique finite sets.

#### 2023-01-18 20:47 - about channels

I apparently don't have much fear about channels, or mediums, and I just wanted to offer a perspective on it. inside of a channel or medium, everything is relative to them, meaning, they entirely take over "reality" and so you're going to get all of your own perspectives of reality in reference to (relative to) the channel or medium. therefore, you kinda get what you expect.

how do you know *who/what* you're channeling? well it's all about tuning. my perspective is that we're all channeling all the time. by being on this planet and observing nature, we're channeling earth. when watching TV or news or something, we suspend reality a moment, and everything becomes relative to that medium (the film or TV production -- that *narrative*).

now, I would like to draw attention to the set of "rules" imposed by the channel/medium (ie. how vibration is transformed in this medium). think everything from galaxy, star, and planetary mediums, but also down to film and social mediums. depending on how powerful the medium is, the more convincing it is to the perceiver what "reality" is. we say, "on earth, I have to pick the rock up before I can throw it" and so in our sequence or narrative, we *believe* that we must in fact, pick the rock up before it can be thrown. these are rules imposed by the medium. in another medium, that may not be necessary. that links to "linear time"

### 2023-01-18 21:33 - I want to talk about depression

katie is beginning to talk about depression, and I feel like I want to write about it. depression feels to me like unexpressed fear. like for example, I just don't feel at all like anything is working out, and everything sucks. I'm just going to let all the awful things I can imagine happen.

I noticed in that sequence (I'm describing my own experiences with depression), there is a recognition of all of the awful things that *could* happen. this is very similar to fear...

OH, I just noticed that fear seems to be related to body and potentially distance (like fear gets stronger as the thing approaches in distance), and depression seems to be related to time. for me, depression is inversely proportional to distance in time -- meaning that it feels like I'm moving *further* away in time from what I want.

fear seems to happen more in a body sense as things get closer, but depression seems to happen more in a time sense -- however, they're both vibration disharmony with the thing that's approaching in space or time. that's an interesting concept because disharmony appears in time as further away in time (future or past), meanwhile disharmony in space, feels like something getting farther away spatially -- which is weird because I usually think of things going away from me as *less fearful*. perhaps though, this is related to loneliness and feeling separated from the thing you love or are connected to.

### 2023-01-18 21:46 - desire is the direction you're heading

katie has said this a few times now and it's bothered me each time. looking at it, I definitely *don't* see desire this way. the direction you're heading is your *focus*, not your desire. it is possible (I've done it), to be running away from the thing I desire for an extended period of time (this is the limited perspective we *choose/agree* to take part in) -- and no matter how hard we try to avoid desire, it will *always* "catch up to you".

the reason why desire will always catch up to you is obvious because it's like a point (or sphere/orb) that is attracting things to it (like the sun), but it's also pushing things away from it. the galaxy is pulling all of the stars in it toward the centre (gavity), and all of the stars are keeping theirselves away from the galaxy centre for as long as they remain vibrationally incompatible with the galaxy. desire is the same way; it's constantly attracting us toward us, and we use our beliefs (our conceptualisation of reality) to hold ourselves away from it. we only become "one" (connect/merge) with our desire when:
1. we can "see" or sympathise with perspective as the thing that we desire (vibrational similarity)
2. our beliefs are no longer holding us back -- vibrational harmony/similarity
3. desire becomes so great, meaning attraction is also really great -- which just means the desire's amplitude is so great that it's definitely influencing your vibration enough to force vibrational similarity.

---

therefore, after talking it out, I have to strongly disagree that desire is the direction you're headed. many people *point* in the direction of their desire for a very long time, never actually allowing theirselves to *go* in the direction of their desire. it's *beliefs* that hold you away from the desire, not the orientation.

### 2023-01-18 22:07 - thinking about the reception of the chorus

one thing that stood out to me when katie was talking about how she receives the chorus is that usually it's like a knowing or that feeling you get after the result of a long conversation (understanding). I've been calling it "zolt" because it's like an instantaneous "download" of the concept. usually, it's my own brain that does not fully understand the concept, and/or I want to get a few more angles on the concept to get it a little better. sometimes that's a voice -- but for me, when I used to have a more physical "voice" talk to me, instead of that feeling of understanding, that's homo-correctus jumping in there to make sure I have the "correct" version.

I stopped listening to the voice because I prefer to work it out and get a few angles on it and see the concept from many different aspects (all angles of the same concept shouldn't ever conflict, but you can definitely tell when you're looking at an oblique angle, and they appear only superficially to be in conflict). I demonstrate that a lot when I say that one thing is another thing viewed "from the opposite direction". the way that I "know" both angles are the same is like how you "know" that a cube is an octahedron. they are the same thing, but one perspective perfectly occults the other, and so they appear only superficially to be dfferent, when in reality they *feel* the same.

---

as an example, let's take the negative version of desire. desire is something that you *do not* be/do/have yet (ie vibrational similarity), so the "opposite" of that is something that *do* be/do/have, which is a feeling of sameness, boredom, or accomplishment. easy, right?

### 2023-01-28 10:25 - micronovas and stuff

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFwzt6m6EqE)

just watched the video. I don't disagree at all with ben. in fact, I *do* agree with him. I've actually been following him since 2011. I'm a bit of a catastrophist hipster: I was on the catastrophe bandwagon before it was cool.

my opinions have changed a bit in the last few years though. I've lived through a few catastrophes of my own and found that they're all perceptual. as a result, my perspective on catastrophe has pretty much gone away completely. I no longer see it happening.

what I want to do is different: I want to turn the south pole of the sun toward the sun. that sounds absurd that I would have such an idea, but I'm sorta like that.

as usual, when I desire something, immediately things begin to fall into place for it to become a reality. to illustrate, for some really strange reason I've been fascinated with shakespere, and the more I study it, the more I've noticed that the stories and events are sort of like symbolic simplations (plays) that we sort of play forward in time.

I have [a whole thing on how to describe them](/correspondance.md#2023-01-27-0917---from-the-spectrum-where-we-are-consciousness), but it would take far too long to try and do it in such a short space here, so I'll summarise by saying they're sort of like prophecies -- kinda like the narratives found in cave art and ancient civilisations. for example, if you read the illiad, and when it says menelaus, lover of the war god, this is a reference to venus -- so when he's trying to thrust a spear through paris (mercury), these are astronomical symbols and interactions. the immortal gods are planets and moons personified into a narrative. well, shakespere is no different, IMO.

I'm skipping a lot of details here, but like I said, I attract solutions. one of the things that's always caught my eye is hamlet which is filled with all sorts of strange astronomy (stuff that doesn't make any sense). the other thing is that fotenbras decides to atack a small worthless village in poland for no reason whatsoever. well if you look at the map, for the prince of norway to get to poland, there's a whole lot of germany to go through -- it's not like he only needs to skip denmark. this "mistake" is telling me that something else is going on...

I'll give the summary for it here (look for "john anthony" on youtube if you want to know more), but the figure "four-ten-brasse" is a reference to de vere, which -- long story short, is apollo. due to sonnet encodings, it seems to me very likely that "poland" is actually "pole land" and the tiny insignificant village he's referring to is "[pilce](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilce)". connecting a bunch of things together, I propose that will become the new "south" pole. the north pole is the domain of zarathustra/santa/vulcan, and the south pole is the domain of satan/saturn (the "night side").

the idea here is to point the antipode of that city toward the sun (it's somewhere right off of new zealand: 50° 31' 28" S, 163° 10' 11" W). from that point on, our new "north" pole will now directly point at the sun while we orbit around thte sun, exactly like our moon always points directly at us. (obviously the pole's location is subject to change)

OK, now we know from agnes' interview that the earth is definitely not solid, and certainly is hollow. if you connect that with katie (the choir)'s description of the earth in its infantile stages (formless and void, but then grew mountains), we can combine those bits there and see that the earth is a spherical resonator and the shell/layer we call the surface of the earth (others are the troposphere, LVZ, ionosphere, etc.) the frequency/density of the the sphere is slowed down to such a speed that it produces silicates (rocks and mountains). the irregular conditions of the solar wind hitting earth causes irregular shaped land masses and mountains with tons of energy coming out of them.. (the solar wind flexes those spheres, sometimes raising or lowering the ionosphere, and causing those major earthquakes cause the crust sphere is getting flexed in either expansion or contraction -- like breathing).

my goal is to keep those spheres regular in both size and density for a time (maintaining the physical layer of rocks, and not becoming less dense (etheric) like a "gas giant"). we would keeping the spheres stable for an undetermined period of time (at least a few decades).

then, while the sun is bombarding our new north pole, this will cause the magnetics to align to that as the new pole and all the energy will go directly in instead of the solar wind brushing over the top and bottom of the planet (creating auroras like they do now). because all of the energy from the sun would be entering directly at the pole and passing down into the planet, and it'll get distributed along the crust and then come bursting out the equator..

for a human, this would be the equivalent of getting a massive inrush of energy into the south (sexual) pole or the north (crown) pole. the human aura espands and increases in frequency. well, same thing for the planet: the whole planet will become more energiesed and we will no longer have nighttime anymore because the air itself will have a luminous quality to it -- even on the "night" side of the planet. it'd basically be daytime all the time.

now, when I've looked at this concept, one of two things happened (and I don't know until we've started). I'll describe them both.

#### situation 1: earth on the inside

the first scenario I've seen is that we kept the spheres of the planet constant, but the pressure from the incoming solar energy on the spheres will continue to grow. at some point so much pressure will grow (ben said 2030-2040) to such a point where we'll need to do somethting. I propose that once enough pressure has built up, we release it and it expands so rapidly that it would go well beyond our solar system.

instead of all of that energy blasting us to bits in a micronova, the planet now, like a microwave transformer, is just transforming the solar input energy, and the micronova shell would extend out of earth in those spheres. let's say that we decide to halt the expansion of that energy somehow (I don't know how) and limit its size and density like it is now, I wonder if we could make cause mountains to form like katie's description of earth in her early stages... tha'd be pretty dope right? imagine living on the inside of a planet that's larger than a solar system. it'd require a lot of pyramids and stone structures to stablise that energy -- a project for future megalithic archiectes to consider, cause I'm just relating the general concept as it came to me.

I think it's cool to, like my life catastrophes, repurpose the energy that I was previously a victim of, to instead make a REALLY BIG planet. how big, I don't know, but I'm thinking really really big ([greater than the sun?](https://youtu.be/YfYeD9Bb0Mg)).

since earth is now on the inside of this expanding shell, we can think of ourselves now as being at the centre of one of those lenticular(?) galaxies -- and whether we can slow that outer shell down to mountains, I don't know, but it would be a shell. the other bodies in the solar system (and even potentially in this galaxy) would be joining us on the inside of this.

each stellar body has a resonant frequency, and if the earth becomes sympathetic with the body or them with us, we will maintain distance from it (neither attracting or repelling it), and so we can essentially control using devices like the great pyramid to affect the vibration of the earth, to control the "destinies" of the objects orbiting in relation to us. we'll have full control over how close all bodies are from us and their orbital period.

also, I imagine at some point, earth's inner star (which should be very dark or black because of it's high frequency vibration) will have to be ejected from the planet (pops out the pole that's opposite to the sun at it's other pole like a woman giving birth), and I figure for a normal spiral galaxy, the the previous sun becomes the input to the opposite pole. so if we're gonna push this one out the north, we'll maintain distance to it like the moon to us and then when the next star is ready, we'll pop that one out the north. alternating between the two, we eventually end up with a string of stars, and their vibrational interactions will eventually create macro rotation of the galaxy.

#### situation 2: flat earth

the other way that I saw it working is quite a bit more interesting: same setup with the earth orbiting the sun with one pole facing the sun. however, instead of letting the energy cause the spheres to expand, instead, we let all of those silicates start to ooze out of the equator. it would be a GIANT volcano that goes all the way around the planet. the magma would ooze out and eventually solidify into rock. obviously it would keep expanding for as long as our sun and inner planet continues to make more energy. this time, instead of micronovaing, we'll allow the sun's output to produce essentially a massive equatorial disk with a mountain in the middle (which is earth).

one side of earth will face the sun, and the other side will face away from the sun. the thing that I like about this idea is that it'll allow the earth to expand indefinitely. for example, I don't know if the sun is expanding or if we're getting further from the sun, so I can't say much about this from that point of view. however, if we wanted to do the flat earth idea, we could keep ourselves at a distance from the sun allowing it to continue to increase its size and output indefinitely: if the output is too high, we just move further away from the sun. we could essentially control the rate at which the equatorial stone platform would expand.

I thought that idea was super cool because that could provide the neo-phonecians (ie denmark) to have a whole bunch of things they can keep secret, like for example new humans on the disk wouldn't ever see a sun. it could be pretty fanciful, but hey, I love to dream :)

#### situation 3: giant hollow planet orbiting around our sun

this situation is again the same setup as situation 1, but the difference is the sun stays on the outside of the planet. we orbit the sun as it's 3rd moon (after mercury and venus). I have no idea what to do with the p-orbitals (saturn, jupiter, uranus, neptune, pluto, etc.), -- and I haven't really thought it through very well yet, cause the idea was inspired by a tatoo on my beautician's arm. it was a *galaxy* that would have orbited a pretty large sun to be able to have, (from the outside looking in, so say from pluto's perspective), the disk of the galaxy depending on its orientation to the sun would either be fully or partially illumiated.

the reason why I haven't thought about this idea more is because I can't even visualise the moon's orbit around earth in relation to the sun, so even less am I able to visualise how a large disk would sorta orbit, and as it rotated, its own disk cast a shadow on itself.

so imagine a coke bottle cap and you shine a flashlight at the top of it, then as I rotate it so that the back is facing the light source, I can see it casting a shadow on itself... OK, now applying that to earth, imagine that we orbited around the sun like usual, but because we're now oriented like uranus, every period (84y for uranus), one side of our planet/galaxy gets illuminated.

I dunno about this idea... I can't really see it, but the idea resonated with me when I first saw it. maybe this is a strawman idea. I dunno.

---

anyway, the whole reason why I wrote all of that is to say that I'm fairly certain that we can repurpose the solar energy and we don't need to be a victim. as I've changed my perception of past catastrophes in my own life, it's easy for me to come up with ideas to repurpose the solar energy to create something bigger. this is *literally* the story of my life -- and I know that this universe is fractal in nature, so if I can find a way to repurpose my past catastrophes by attracting what I want, I see no reason the the planet couldn't do the same thing.

I'm done yammering for now. I know it sounds funny to say I want to make a galaxy instead of getting blown to bits -- and it really is up to anyone who wants to join me.

I also know that this next statement I'm about to say will sound weird too, but I'm pretty certain that *I* will be able to find a solution to the situation and I will be creating that reality. those that want to create for theirselves a different reality, in my perspective can live out their disaster fantasies on a planet inside my galaxy :)

hmmmm songs playing while I was writing this was: "zarathustra - embrace your insanity" and "we are the chosen ones" -- interesting song synchronicities... who would have thought there could be more than one "chosen one"

OK, cya later, cheers
kenny

---

the specifics of the scenario don't really need to be super fleshed out, just it needs to give a really good concept idea meanwhile all of the data is being worked out.

personally, I really like the idea of being on the inside of a giant planet. though I have my sights set on galaxy sized, I think it's probably best to start with one maybe solar sytstem in size, figure out all of the things, then put that planet on the inside of the new galaxy-sized planet.. just imagine being able to look out from earth and see mountain ranges across a huge expanse. then, also imagine that perhaps even our eyesight gets so good that we could essentially look out and see trees on the mountains hovering at a distance of about jupiter. talk about a panoramic view that would be incredibly impressive :)

you know, when the vision/concept came to me, I was on earth, and I could look out and my perception wasn't fully locked into my body, so when I looked toward a big mountain range, I kinda flew or floated above them, then could see a race of primitive humans way way down, and then I could zoom/fly in to look at them a little closer. if we're not able to do that perceptually (I'm working on it, btw), we can definitely produce technology that could assist such a perceptive capability.

the thing that kinda gets me the most about this idea is I kinda want to make my own race of humanoids and then figure out another form of perception (working on this one too, btw) where "I" become the species/concept of the new race of hominids. when we think of "I" we think of a single being, composed of many atoms and molecules (of course), but not like millions of individual bodies all interacting with their environment and others. I could imagine creating all sorts of "controls" (not physical ones, but conceptual ones) that sort of implant ideas into their minds in the form of symbols. I would also tie them to cycles (actual and artificial) of mine, so that it would feel like I'm in a constantly ever-more exhilerating dance with them. sure there would be ups and downs, but as a whole, I imagine the experience would be of greater and greater states of ecstasy.

none of that is required to ease the micronova experience, though. I don't really operate on problems; I just find ways to make the things I want to build, possible. and, I like to think about those kinds of things... :)

---

so, in resume, building up the image of what it would be like to live on an earth that is in the centre of a massive structure that is starting to form mountains and a solid structure over the coming decades (and if they could even see that because it'll be daylight 24/7 here), and what it will be like living on earth with one side of the planet always protected from the sun, while the other is very energetic.

I know I personally am pretty good with the sun. if the weather weren't controlled so much, I'd live in a very green and lush temperate environment no matter how much sunlight is hitting us, because I too have weather super powers (you mentioned that was one of yours as well, and I think that stuff is cool) therefore, I'll definitely be living on the "day side" of the planet, and it's going to be pretty much a paradise.

the next thing I noticed is I should probably get rid of the "I'm making a galaxy and sucks to be you if you don't want to join me" attitude. I'll ditch that, repaint the picture of just the earth experience and like with all tech startups, I just know the final product is feasible and awesome, so we'll just figure it out along the way. like, for example, I just don't have enough data to be able to comment to much on the spherical resonator stuff, so we'll have to build instrumentation to figure that stuff out... OK, reaction says, they have the data, it's just not publically available. so yeah, I mean, I know it's possible, it just needs a marketing touch to become a mainstream idea.

as for the earth experience, I mean -- if you're living in austrailia, new zealand or south america and the sun is bothering you -- you'll end up moving -- but I imagine it'll be pretty green an luscious, so the weather will probably be fine. what will happen though is that law of attraction will be going so fast, nearly instant manifestation of thoughts and emotions may be the factor that encourages them to relocate. I don't forsee any problems with climate or weather being a problem though.

I know I'm going to ramble a bit with this video, cause I can feel a tsunami of ideas. first, I explained why the numbers 10 and 12 are important -- because it's the balance of the 5 and 6. one can look at this from the promethian perspective of the difference between the "gods" (6) and "man" (5). the gods had six fingers, meanwhile man only has five. we have two hands, so 12 and 10 are the max options each race has.

you don't have to look at this from the promethian perspective though. I only learned of the promethian perspective recently, so first I want to say the other perspective. 5 is a really interesting number that I've always been interested in. my birthdate is 5, 7 x 4. and so I've given a lot of thought about what each of those numbers.

tesla said to look at the 3, 6, 9 -- which (tesla's) perspective is, like the procmethian less perceived by me. I prefer 5, and the day that I figured out so-called "penrose" tilinng I've been hooked on the idea of tiling, not in 3 (triangles), 4 (squares), or 6 (hexagons), but tiling in 5 (penrose). I just noticed "pen" and "rose". shakespere likes his pens and roses :)

anyway, for me 4 is the earth, and 3 is something to do with frequency that I haven't really understood fully. you know symbolene is marked with the page number of 369, which is a mistake, so it's important.

the next thing that I noticed is that she's trolling (so it's importnt) because she made the joke that 10 is used for binary and computer software... there are 10 types of people in this world, right so 10 dimensions is important.

I'll tell you why it's important -- because it's how many fingers man has. it's the number of "options" that our brain perceives. when you look at this like a board game, if the cells are squares, there are 4T options. however, when you look at it as a hexagon, there are 6T options. that sounds like a really rad thing to have an extra dimension and tiling is infinite just like 5T is,

but therefore... a 6T perspective is that everything is a "octave" of the next thing -- that is, double or half of what it is previous; the bigger the better. 5T extends out toward infinity in an infinitely no-self-similiar expression of itself. a bigger thing is always bigger smaller thing, and each thing -- no matter where you draw the line -- is different from every other thing, each part composed of a few different "genders" -- if you want to look at shapes as sort of the smallest self-similar outline.

that's an interesting idea. I'd never thought about that before. I really want to know more about them now. I remember I got really interested in them once after watching a video on it. I didn't like the shapes that penrose had for his tiles, so I redivided the pentagram a different way. I'm sure it'll tile, so all variations of a pentagon with that amount (2/5?) will tile, I would imagine. I'm not certain though -- which is weird. I do know that I'm on the right track to figuring that out.

anyway, so 10 is really awesome for us humans (like me). I really identify with the 5, and it's really one of my most favourite things. I remember I was really fascinated by vi hart's father's incredible work with forms with five, everywhere. funny coincidence her last name is hart (heart?).

the gods really like that constant, bigger is better tiling of six, with an option pack of 12 -- wich I think is fine, however I like 11 even more.

for me, the ultimate number is 11.  I never really knew why, but I just really always really liked the numbers 5 and 11. my password is 1155 cause I just really like it, you know.

anyway, the idea of having 11 options is tantalising to me becauxe I just found out sometime recently that the result (*in base 10*) is a number that's triangular (*in base 10*) shape -- which means predictable; it's the best of both worlds. just saying. there's obviously room for expansion as well, and anyone can go as high that they want to go, but I really like 11 and 5 cause its relation to Infinity. so keep me here.

on the other hand, you have the "gods" way of looking at it with the 6 -- the number between the 3 and the 9. each of these dimensions are symmetrical and circular, as all circular things are. let's keep watching...

so I go to look up this woman that she's talking about, "renee jones" -- and she has this book "inside out" -- which I am. I see things from the inside out. for me, there's no looking back. for me, it's only forward.

so, I read the description for the book, and she's just sort of writing this future story out for herself -- which I think is a really great idea.

like, I can really imagine how great to be able to write your own sickest fantasies into a book, aed wake up inside of your own story. I totally got it from that perspective, but that perspective is not the inside out that it's being portrayed to be. so again a mistake, so it's probably important. we're talking about the pen-rose here; these are obvious mistakes that I notice, so when I notice a mistake, it's kind of like a "crack in the matrix" -- these are markers to say, "look at this from another perspective" -- which is what I do. easy.

furthermore, I'd like to add a small mental picture of yourself in a small little ship and you're just *blasting* through space, and there's all this friction, depending on how much "stuff" is in the medium. some mediums are more viscious than others, and so the speed at which your topped out att is the maxiumum thrust minus the resistance of the medium. this is the way I see myself.

the way that the image looks is that I'm basically plowing into the future, standing still. therefore, the way to deal with it is just to get good at dodging stuff. I'm a master dodger. if you were to think of yourself as the centre of a sort of constellation of other entities, people, planets, and stars -- I don't want to get hit. collisions are bad. see what I mean. I'm specifically thinking about sophia right now and how stability comes from having as few impacts as possible. I originally learned this from rupert. I'm a sort of confrontational person; not subtle at all; rupert is not. rupert avoided confrontation at all costs, yet at the same time would maximise his opinion of them -- just up to the point right before confrontation. he knew everyone's limit, so he pushed evvery limit that I had. I learned a lot about myself from him, because he knew that I knew that I could never actually "get" him, so I didn't mess with him. you don't want  to fight someone that doesn't get too much involved in the inertia of someone else. || you know it's really kind of funny becausse I'm a lot like that too where I just kinda dodge everything, and I just sort of let desire just kind of attract to me things, cause they all seem to be flying toward me.

see how I'm the centre, and everything around is all coming toward me in time --, I could try and resist others, but at some point, I don't have the ability to resist something, so I just have to dodge all of the stuff that I don't want. huh. I didn't know that about myself. I do it naturally as a bi-product of my desire to feel the way I want to feel. some people just don't feel like things I want to encounter, so I avoid them. for me, they're in a whole separate world to me. I don't want to be a part of their network of thoughts and ideas. I like the way that I feel, and it's not like *them*, so I don't. easy. dodge easy. doge looks like dodge.
