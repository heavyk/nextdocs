nikki-ana-jones

I have really enjoyed watching her videos so far. I also feel some sort of familiarity with her as well. her name is even similar to mine in that I've been called "nikki" by various others, I identify with anatau, and if my father hadn't have joined a cult, my last name would be jones -- so it's kinda weird, I suppose, but also really cool.

I started by wathing her interviews with jason reza jorjani and then watched a few more. I have a few thoughts that I can't really get out of my head, so I'd like to write them here. at the end of her videos, she puts her email address and I keep feeling like I want to email her, so perhaps to prevent my interaction with others, I find it possible that nosebook would rather that I didn't talk to anyone directly so that they can control the information, so instead, I think I probably should get my ideas out here instead of actually talking to people directly so that they can control all of the information.

I find her story very fascinating. car accident at 16 and complete loss of childhood memories, then a difficult time getting back into her body... wow that sounds exactly like my experience, cept I started with a brain haemorrhage at 16 and then my car accident happened later which removed me once again from my body .. so it's cool to hear stuff like that.. I love it.

anyway, the thing I wanted to comment on is that she (and nikki) talked about how in her NDE, it felt as if lots and lots of time passes very rapidly, such that a few hours here is equivalant to hundreds or perhaps thousands of years in the other world.

the other thing she said is that meditation for her is difficult because she already has a quiet mind. I'm writing this, because I feel these two concepts as connected, so I want to write about it.

when I was younger, mom found it impossible to talk to me because I was always thinking about so many other things, so she would bounce me up and down or have me focus on physical movement in my body so that my brain would be available to listen.

I learned later on in my life that I'm a "hands on" type person where I need to *do* something in order to focus. some people could just visualise in their minds and things, but the version of me in my mind was always very different than what my body was doing. she mentioned this when talking about balet and how she had to really pay attention to what her body was doing because often times it was doing something different than what her mind thought it was doing. her instructor keeps having her focus on her body and what it's doing.

this style of learning is related to feeling, motion and everything is relative. I struggled a lot with trying to find absolutes, but all animation is relative to something else. I paid a lot of attention to how other people moved because I could see that they way that they moved described their emotion a lot better than their words would. I mean, it's easy to see when someone says they're doing fine and their body has sharp movements. relaxed has a smoothe motion to it.

then I started to learn that my thoughts had a similar movement to them. the way that the thought passed along my mind had an animation to it that would tell me of how the thought felt. I would also notice how different thoughts caused my body to animate differently. because of that, I'm hyper conscious about how my body moves. this was debilitating at first because I focued so much on how others thought about me. those are thoughts -- though they may not be internal dialogue.

---

I said all of that because it's also related. I find it hard to believe that you (oops, I switched to second person) don't have thoughts. the reason why I think that is because if your mind were actually clear, you would be having an experience that feels like thousands of years are passing every single day.

the brain is kinda like a filtering and focusing mechanism (tuning), and what you're tuned to is what you're picking up. so, what I imagine is happening is -- well, let's say that normal frequency range is around 3-10MHz, right and so on that frequency, there is little happening. however in the NDE, the brain's filter got removed and so you are now getting innundated with a tremendous amount of data from just outside of normal operating frequency -- say, 20-200MHz, and so time seems to speed up because it's at a higher frequency. now, when you're doing physical excercise, this is basically raising your frequency response range, and so this allows you to begin to receive more thoughts from your inner being, which is broadcasting at a frequency a little higher than normal range for you. that's all.

I imagine that during physical activity, it feels like time starts to speed up again and more things seem to happen in the same amount of time again; perhaps, not hundreds of years worth, but the higher the frequency you allow yourself to receive, the more things will seemingly pass in the same amount of time.

cool, yeah, so like cheers!
