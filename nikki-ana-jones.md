nikki-ana-jones

I have really enjoyed watching her videos so far. I also feel some sort of familiarity with her as well. her name is even similar to mine in that I've been called "nikki" by various others, I identify with anatau, and if my father hadn't have joined a cult, my last name would be jones -- so it's kinda weird, I suppose, but also really cool.

I started by wathing her interviews with jason reza jorjani and then watched a few more. I have a few thoughts that I can't really get out of my head, so I'd like to write them here. at the end of her videos, she puts her email address and I keep feeling like I want to email her, so perhaps to prevent my interaction with others, I find it possible that nosebook would rather that I didn't talk to anyone directly so that they can control the information, so instead, I think I probably should get my ideas out here instead of actually talking to people directly so that they can control all of the information.

I find her story very fascinating. car accident at 16 and complete loss of childhood memories, then a difficult time getting back into her body... wow that sounds exactly like my experience, cept I started with a brain haemorrhage at 16 and then my car accident happened later which removed me once again from my body .. so it's cool to hear stuff like that.. I love it.

anyway, the thing I wanted to comment on is that she (and nikki) talked about how in her NDE, it felt as if lots and lots of time passes very rapidly, such that a few hours here is equivalant to hundreds or perhaps thousands of years in the other world.

the other thing she said is that meditation for her is difficult because she already has a quiet mind. I'm writing this, because I feel these two concepts as connected, so I want to write about it.

when I was younger, mom found it impossible to talk to me because I was always thinking about so many other things, so she would bounce me up and down or have me focus on physical movement in my body so that my brain would be available to listen.

I learned later on in my life that I'm a "hands on" type person where I need to *do* something in order to focus. some people could just visualise in their minds and things, but the version of me in my mind was always very different than what my body was doing. she mentioned this when talking about balet and how she had to really pay attention to what her body was doing because often times it was doing something different than what her mind thought it was doing. her instructor keeps having her focus on her body and what it's doing.

this style of learning is related to feeling, motion and everything is relative. I struggled a lot with trying to find absolutes, but all animation is relative to something else. I paid a lot of attention to how other people moved because I could see that they way that they moved described their emotion a lot better than their words would. I mean, it's easy to see when someone says they're doing fine and their body has sharp movements. relaxed has a smoothe motion to it.

then I started to learn that my thoughts had a similar movement to them. the way that the thought passed along my mind had an animation to it that would tell me of how the thought felt. I would also notice how different thoughts caused my body to animate differently. because of that, I'm hyper conscious about how my body moves. this was debilitating at first because I focued so much on how others thought about me. those are thoughts -- though they may not be internal dialogue.

---

I said all of that because it's also related. I find it hard to believe that you (oops, I switched to second person) don't have thoughts. the reason why I think that is because if your mind were actually clear, you would be having an experience that feels like thousands of years are passing every single day.

the brain is kinda like a filtering and focusing mechanism (tuning), and what you're tuned to is what you're picking up. so, what I imagine is happening is -- well, let's say that normal frequency range is around 3-10MHz, right and so on that frequency, there is little happening. however in the NDE, the brain's filter got removed and so you are now getting innundated with a tremendous amount of data from just outside of normal operating frequency -- say, 20-200MHz, and so time seems to speed up because it's at a higher frequency. now, when you're doing physical excercise, this is basically raising your frequency response range, and so this allows you to begin to receive more thoughts from your inner being, which is broadcasting at a frequency a little higher than normal range for you. that's all.

I imagine that during physical activity, it feels like time starts to speed up again and more things seem to happen in the same amount of time again; perhaps, not hundreds of years worth, but the higher the frequency you allow yourself to receive, the more things will seemingly pass in the same amount of time.

cool, yeah, so like cheers!

### 2022-09-02 07:11 - feeling sequence meditation

I've been thinking fairly frequently about the idea of having a quiet mind that I mentioned in the previous one about shealynn. a few weeks ago, I seemed to have relatively little easy time quieting my mind when going to meditate. I even got so far as I was observing myself observing myself and I felt a huge rush of energy after that. that was the only time it happened though, as since then my mind has been all over the place.

yesterday I got the idea while meditating. it goes basically like this. pretend that you're a dancer or something while meditating and you have a sequence of postures or positions that you're going to go between. what I do is I just *feel* each one of them. I don't believe they produce a picture or even a posture in my mind because I don't see it. it's the feeling.

---

let me back up a little bit further and explain that it's my experience that a thought *always* produces a feeling. it's usually the case that a feeling produces a picture or a thought, but it doesn't have to. it is possible to just feel something without having it "manifest" into a thought or feeling. in fact, the longer that I can hold that feeling, the more powerful the manifestation will be. it's an exercise worth trying and a potential thing to try meditating by holding a feeling. I've done it before and it works well.

but, what about a sequence of feelings? that was the innovation that totally made this new meditation completely different. I experimented a little bit with it, and I noticed that I didn't feel it nearly as powerfully when I tried to imagine what that feeling is. if I picked feelings that had physical counterparts like "sadness", "weakness", "irony", "labourious", etc. (yes, I like to often focus on negative feelings because they're so much easier to pivot into the wanted aspect of the same feeling) -- then it didn't work as well.

it seemed to work best when I picked feelings that I'd never felt before, or feelings that I couldn't feel. I guess that's kinda hard to explain, so just try it I suppose :) the sequence part seemed to be pretty important too.

### 2022-09-03 07:21 - meditation update

OK, I didn't really write down any technique because I have only done it twice now (once this morning and once yesterday).

the way that I'm doing it now is that I try and quiet my mind until the word thoughts begin to start. when the word thoughts start, that's because me mind wants to be active.

from there, I start to feel something (it doesn't really matter what) each breath. I don't try and manifest those feelings/concepts into words or sensation. I just feel them. if you're just feeling and not manifesting, it should feel nearly the same as meditating.

there are a lot of interesting things to note in this state, and the first thing is that my mind has a sort of service mode where it's constantly paying attention to me and making sure that what I'm doing is good/acceptable/proper. this mode starts to get really loud, as I seem to become pretty aware of everything that I'm thinking because it often doesn't jive (resonate) with what I'm feeling.

the other interesting thing can be explained like this. if I want to feel sadness, I can often times get a full emotional sensation in my body as I feel sadness, however, that "sadness" concept stops getting a physical reaction, and starts to become something more akin to feeling computer, feeling hammer, or feeling data processing. they're all just a sort of thing that exists out there. I can feel computer but it doesn't produce an emotional response. data processing, I can feel what it's like to have to do tedius data processing, or what it feels like to make sense of large amounts of data, but again, I don't really feel much sensation on that.

I choose hammer on purpose because there is a northern european(?) phrase that I picked up somewhere where you *can* feel hammer. it feels really good, like kinda powerful, successful, or awesome. however, the tool doesn't really have much feeling for me.

what I noticed is that the core of the concept has very little feeling to it. the core of the concept is nothing more than just a concept, and all the layers of sensation, meaning, and emotion are things that we have added on to the concept. it's possible to begin to interact with these core concepts directly without having to worry about the outer layers.

### 2023-01-18 20:08 - world made of beliefs

as katie weiss was talking about the chorus existing in a world without beliefs, she said it's hard to relate to, but do a heroic dose of mushrooms and you'll see pretty quickly that our entire world is made up of beliefs. it also made sense what terence was trying to say when he said our world is made of language (which is a subset of beliefs -- we even believe we all use a similar dictionary and share the same conceptual reality when conversing)
