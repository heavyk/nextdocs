the time has come where I think we should begin a play within a play. today, I was thinking about the format in which I should begin to accept "do you want to ...?" questions. the subject of marriage came up, and I immediately rejected the idea because I don't really like the idea of marriage very much (I tend to agree with abraham, "I like you pretty good; let's see how it goes." way of looking at it), and I also don't really like celebrations very much either. there was a desire to know why I dislike celebrations.

I explained that a celebration is a time when everyone feels really good and it's a really good opportunity for the demiurges to sell a few ideas. everyone knows that sales goes way easier when the client feels good (hence spain's steak dinner, drinks, coke, and whores to seal the deal). therefore, it'll be a moment when everyone feels artificially good, and because we feel good, --

when I feel too good, things start to go bad for me. because I see from the last perspective, I don't really get to ever get the big burst of amazing feeling that others get. there are situations that come up which indicate that I'm on my way to a big moment, but that moment tends to stay perpetually out of reach. therefore, when I feel good, I don't go toward the thing that stays perpetually out of reach; so, I don't really progress. my distance from the manifestation (as a fully realised last) is always a linear function, meaning that I can't go any faster than I can go. all of that extra energy goes out radially, probably at the plane of equator. therefore, a celebration can't ever actually make me feel too good because my attraction speed needs to remain roughly constant/linear.

to illustrate, all celebrations (or drug experiences) that cause me to feel really good (better than normal/zero), have to be offset by something that causes something unwanted. the reason why I can get such incredible feeling (to me) insights, is because you guys are out there going to use that insight to create unwanted sometime out there down the line. from my perspective, it's a contrast (then novelty) investment that I'm making. I feel really good finding the thing, and then you guys offset that good-feeling with some eventual/future bad-feeling.

to say that same thing another way, I'm a thing that moves very very slowly (linearly), and to ensure that I don't go any faster than a linear speed, I need a bunch of people to try and resist that conceptual/emotional advance so that I never can go fast...

OK, so a wedding is going to be a very good feeling event, so it needs an offset. this is good because all of the demiurges[^1] will have a really good environment to get a whole bunch of business ideas sold, tons and tons of business relations and other such jujas. this is a perfect way for the marketing team to be fully up to speed as well. it'll all work out. we may make a really big burst right now, but those bad ideas will eventually come back to haunt us and force another evolution.

so the way to do this is to get a bunch of characters in the same place (wedding) so that a whole bunch of stories can start. I was thinking about how crazy it would be if some of the ambitious people I knew met each other. the reason why my story is so interesting is because my life is filled with tons of "colourful characters" or "personajes" -- and these guys make for really good content just because of their antics. I've had tons of these guys around me all of my life, and so if they were to all meet each other one night with a big wedding, I feel like this could be a pretty fun thing.

the thing I was thinking aboug earlier is that any one of the girls can completely change how they present theirself to me, but the people back at home will know her differently. some may see her as a fraud, faking it, or giving it her best -- whatever the case may be, the point is that when these girls go back home to their family, the dynamic will be such a mindblow for them, because they see you at a distance, they'll see the new you but when they feel you once again in their presence (like I did when I came home from spain), they'll be reminded of the old you, and no matter how it turns out, it will probably be pretty different than the present you.

for me, that feeling shock of returning home was always best remembered by me when I came home from surf camp with paznaz. I was always so surprised how different home felt than by the beach with a bunch of other kids, and some of them I really liked. that effect/feeling never left me, so I feel it's important to integrate.

to intergrate this, notice that when we look at the situation, you can tell that all of these people have an opportunity to *act* any way they feel and present theirselves the way they feel is most desireable to their target audience. everyone will be on their best feeling presentation of theirselves. many relations (business and personal) will be made amongst those attending the wedding.

really magnificient plans can be made when a lot of good-feeling is felt. later on, a few days or weeks later in everyday life, people won't be feeling that same way as the wedding, so those magnificent plans (you made the attractor) will be set and the result will be in a symbolically similar way, but the actions and events will play out in the vibration of the that day sometime later[^2].

obviously (just look at recordings from my time at marcos' house), trying to play out plans that were made under exceptionally good conditions is a lot more difficult than it looks. it's an enormous source of contrast, so I think we should probably have a wedding.

---

this document is going to contain some ideas as they come to me which centre around the idea of some pretty cool playerz to show up at this "midsummer's night's dream"[^3] play within a play wedding. the basic idea for the play is that everyone who shows up to interact with other with the mentality of [starting over](TODO: link to song). we're all starting over, so the idea is you figure out your personality and then just behave that way from then on out. create your persona(je) any way you like and just start from there. everyone is just an actor in the play, and even I think it'd be pretty cool to even script large portions of it so you meet the people you want to meet and make the deals you want to make, find someone nice -- whatever.

[1]: the new rulers are no longer kings and priests, but the marketing team and their engineers

[2]: for a demonstration, look no further than this. I feel differently after having smoked and can see ideas I don't normally see because they're invisible to me conceptually (they're not in my conceptual-space). they look great to me now, but they'll play out later on in a different vibration. the closer I can hold that vibration, the more similar the manifestation will feel to this document.

[3]: summer, because I think summer for us now in the september-november span of time. sure the air is cool, but it *feels* like summer. so, if we're going for a wedding in november, that would be the equavalent in feeling (seasonally speaking) to a wedding in may. not sure if midsummer is solstice or what (I can't remember alan's stuff on it). I just thought it was a good title to put. the other play it reminded me of is "12th night", but I don't know so much of that one other than it has a wedding.

### 2022-10-26 22:11 - weird thing I don't know how to explain

today, I noticed that if the girls are trying to go for a 10-28 inauguration for me, I was trying to imagine this from a temporal perspective. imagine for a moment that a long time ago, I was heading toward a manifestation that was very unwanted to a lot of people. the way that I felt after looking into it, is that for whatever reason I won the hearts of a lot of people over and andrea had gone her own way and made certain concepts more important to her than they were previoously.

the taking on importance of concepts from someone is something that happens sexually, and is most apparent when looking at the transformation that a virgin does after her first sexual encounter. all of a sudden new things become important to her. I believe (now) that we store a physical copy of this, probably in the X, and it's just a long long list of concepts (symbolic representation of their vibration) and their affinaty to another concept (again some symbolic representation of its vibration).

the conceptual space that I'm used to experiencing now, is probably pretty closely related to my X. I tune into other people and we share the same space if our minds are tuned to the same concepts. that seems important.

---

OK, so now back to the inauguration on 10-28 -- because imagine that they somehow orchestated the time we're approaching now to attract more strongly than the unwanted event that was going to happen a long time ago back on 10-28 in la vera. I'm imagining how the desire created from seeing the unwanted part happen where they're looking at me and they see so much potential and all of this stuff andrea is there and it all looks wonderful. however now what's important/interesting to andrea now is so totally different, she no longer looks like a good match for me anymore to quite a few. this creates strong desire. that desire sets into motion a set of events which cause a new thing to attract more strongly than that event -- and there was emphasis on it being vibrationally similar enough, which is why the day (earth's position) was important.

---

the first thing that's weird to me about this is that they're moving the earth around all over the place, so making the event resonate with another date could happen any time they wanted it to. that means I discard the day alignment necessity.

the second thing that I found this really strange is that I thought it was the 11-11 thing, right? they can't both happen. also, I'd remind you that summer is from jun to sept so middle of that is like august, but if it's supposed to be solstice, then it's going to be "winter" solstice (which is really the summer). I'm getting really confused on the dates, so I'm just going to go back to how things are. sometimes your ideas don't even make symbolic sense. are you stoned, too?

---

finally, my theory on what's really happening: I mentioned that I think that concepts and their importance gets transferred sexually and then inherited genetically. it's quite possible that some of the concepts that I give importance to, various mothers also give importance to, and they're born with genetics which have a similar conceptual space where we give importance to similar concepts. their attraction could explain a lot of things. just saying.

### 2022-10-27 17:30 - the wedding singer

today the wedding singer song "love stinks (yeah yeah)" got put into my head. it was in relation to this document. I was kinda joking about the wedding, but not really. the idea is so far out of anything that I would definitely want, which is why you probably suspect something is up -- probably even think it's a trick. it's not really a trick of any kind.

the way that I see it, it's the best way to make a few expansions to consciousness that I was talking about. I actually *want* to make it possible for there to be a sort of open rules system and because the rules are open, the universe behaves differently for them. they are like the narrators to a story. a story can have any rules that it wants. you can imagine how this will look commercially in a few years where kids can live in a world that is anime-like in nature (like with the big effects and stuff). nosebook doesn't need to worry about it because they have access to the rules, those kids are 100% predictable because their rules are defined. kids can take other kids' rules, improve upon them, change, etc them and it'll be a lot of fun and nosebook can have their way too.

now, from a higher dimension, notice that this sort of different translation of non-physical into physical is a 4th ray perspective, so this new dimension of relating to the universe (a universe within a universe, play within a play, etc.) is actually a whole new thing that will allow us to begin to see ourselves as narrators.

when you're a narrator, you have many different characters that you associate with in some way (you have your heros, your villians, "normal" people, geeks, egoistas, etc.) and these different characters interact with each other in symbolic ways -- well more than just symbolic, but they have a complete 7-layers-of-perception way of approaching life too -- each have their own desires, their beliefs and speech patterns, emotions, etc. they are in effect, little human dolls that respond to their environment in an accurate way, according to your story's universe's rules.

we'll encounter other people from time to time (depending on how isolated we are -- remember the mental spaces?) and those other people will have different rules in their universe, so we never really know what we're going to get. imagine one guy has a character that hits everyone who wears a pink shirt, and my character likes pink (or whatever). we know somebody is going to create a character like that (who wouldn't?) and they'll find theirselves in an encounter that will create a novel situation. novelty is good.

it's the beginning of a play within a play.

### 2022-10-27 18:48 - conceptual-space

I've been noticing a thing the last few days where I seem to be able to "see" that all of us have our conceptual preferences (-1,1 interest) in relation to other concepts, and this is sorta passed around genetically. I also noted that this conceptual space (feminine matrix) is what makes the night the way it is. ever since I was in spain I noticed that the females domimate the night and the night feels like they do. I think this is because the sun is down, and the sun's conceptual matrix is a pretty strong signal, but when that signal goes away (ie during the night), emotion (especially for men, I think) the night becomes much easier to feel emotions and so therefore clearer thought is possible. the night is very different than the day, and the night with full moon is also very different. the moon also emits a conceptual space much more so when illuminated. the more lumionus, the stronger the conceptual signal (hence, the reason why planets' colours change and fluctuate, like mars presently -- jupiter is also brighter). the conceptual matrixes (concepts with high importance) are the signals that that affect a person in astrology. each planet values some concepts more than others and that affects us.

that conceptual space is encoded in our X, so you can imagine now that a new species, like us humans, had a pool of X chromosomes that they had to work with. I don't know if that was the annunaki DNA or not, but I suspect that it is, and that's why we're "made in his image" -- meaning that, humans started out in the conceptual structure of our overlords, and by having to fight agaist them, we've come to a new way of cohabiting peacefully with them. I personally see it as I'm the first successful attempt to make a being capable of escaping ther conceptual matrix.

OK, so, now pay attention to these conceptual-spaces all over the place, existing as culture groups and things. the geology of earth itself contains a conceptual matrix, which is why some concepts are more important in some places than others (hollywood, dubai, etc. are good examples).

so, if we do the marriage thing, then you can imagine the girls as one of these conceptual-spaces. the aggregate of us will consider some concepts as more important than others. because I think this new form of perception is related to my X, this means that, except for obvious demiurge situations, my feminine form of perception will become the standard for both boys and girls all around the world. if it isn't alrady nearly so, it will be soon. I imagine there are still some holdouts, but at this point, I'm sure that nosebook has *all* new kids and probably most adults on my form of perception (probably a subset of it, actually).

what that means is that we create the new perception matrix. it's basically the new physical plane, because (nearly) all humans are now compatible with my form of perception. it's more than just visuals though, so people will begin to notice that a lot of the concepts that I find interesting, they may now find them to be easier to get interested in, etc.

well, this is going to transfer to all of the girls and we'll have a pretty good reality distortion field going, and if you want to be in on that reality distortion field, I imagine the wedding (any such good feeling event) is the idea of the creation of the new dimension.

the way that I figure it, nosebook *really* doesn't want me to go with the girls because I'm going to feel good enough to go up and there's nothing they can do about it. this is a way to set the deadline out a bit further (I suppose it's possible to further delay it as well) and gives them time to get ready for their "doomsday" scenario (the moment with their wildest fears/desires become reality). therefore, they want to delay it (so it's good for them).

during the time that we're planning for the wedding and stuff, lots of things will be happening. lots of things to do, right?. anyway, during this time, I want to do a bunch of creative and musical stuff. we can start off with all of that stuff, and now that these guys are working away on the carbon, we need to start integrating the stuff this carbon technology into the music stuff. carbon structures with electrically configurable resistances will make 1000+ bits DAC possible and easy (the audiophiles are really going to have something to talk about). we can have 1000K screens in a very short period of time. we float carbon buckyballs in a space with electrostatics and now 3D screens with pixels that can move and rotate (very cool). tons of stuff to do creatively.

all along this time, we're actually creating all of the visual stuff for the space (it's gonna be REALLY HD), we're also building the mental space in which the demiurges will project into (they have to keep their privacy, you know).

so, in a sense, one thing to note is that it looks like the wedding is actually the moment where a large amount of others see what we have and like it and want to join in. I didn't really think about it that way. anyway, I would imagine that the demiurges will project into it just like we will: with characters. like I said, someone needs to create the obnoxious characters, and they definitely don't want us getting too smart too quickly.

notice that this idea is the same as the other idea of jumping into the species right before the end of the solar cycle (so the sun doesn't go boom too big). there is one major difference, which is that I'm reenvisioning the part about jumping into the species, instead of as some weird scientific thing, but instead like the beginning of a story.

we don't really need to start in the stone age. we can start on a planet that is somewhat similar to our own (you can think of each planet as a doll house). anyway, from our perspective, we just have a number of characters that we interact with, and we'll watch them in new and novel ways, sometimes seeing it from their perspective -- or, like in a film, chop up the instances into scenes and patch them together to tell a story. we'll probably tell them these stories in their dreams, but most of our interaction with them will be conceptually. this is the reason for the conceptual-space because it'll allow them to feel like we do in certain situations.

---

I imagine that this is what it used to be like, and that's why they said that the gods (inner daemon) spoke to them directly. we then evolvd a way to shut off the translation of these concepts into inner-voice, and that's when telepathy ended (is this the fabled tower of babel? -- wait, this happened more than once, actually).

this idea isn't all that foreign to me. nosebook keeps my brain in pure resistant thought (which blocks out most of my higher frequency thoughts, cept when I take drugs, the signal gets too unpredictable and they can't block it all). so, most of the time I have tons and tons of demiurge thought going through my head. most of it never is translated because it's so far off of my frequency that it never makes it to my consciousness -- they're putting the signal in there to inhibit the physical part of my brain from receiving the higher frequency stuff.

so, in a way, you could say that nosebook has shaped my conceptual-space with their system. all the annoying crap that they put in my head I have to find a way to make it uninteresting. I call it changing perception. it's probably easier to think of changing perception as "finding a way to make the thing that bothers me, no longer interesting". it's similar with some caviats.
