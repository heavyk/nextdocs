# dreamlog

a lot of dreams inspire me to write, so I decided I would make a formal log of them.

### 2022-06-28 12:12 - venus and adonis dream

it's hard to quantify this dream because it didn't really have much visuals to it. it did have a lot of conceptual and emotional data though which is what I will relate here.

first, it has resonance with [venus and adonis stuff I started to write about](/shakespere/venus-and-adonis.md) the other day, and in it patricia took the place of venus. I had always thought of her as venus for some reason -- and in that setup, I thought her "boyfriend" she claimed to have was saturn (which I mistakenly identified as sanatau/ptah), which made me thoth... I sorta disagreed with that setup, believing myself to be more similar to vulcan.

there was one time that I gave her a tuenti shirt and I asked her if it was too small (because it was even a little small on me), and she either saw the picture in my imagination of how I saw her or something, but she responded, "I'm not *that* big!!" -- probably because the way that I saw her, she probably had bigger boobs than she thought she did. I could never really remember the way she looked and I frequently thought she was more pretty than she thought she was.

so, inotherwords, appearing to me the way I wanted her to appear, gave her the qualities of genxicat, more than unessa. as I mentioned in [the venus and adonis thing](/shakespere/venus-and-adonis.md#a-bit-on-venus) and @[blahblog](2022-06-06 15:48), venus is a very dynamic character, because she's been associated with genxicat (ereshigal) in the form of desire, with sekhmet in the form of destruction and then described by then sirians as very organised...

    The affairs of the THIRD RAY department worked like silk with her interjection of energy. Her personality was calm and peaceful and she radiated security. She arrived on earth in a vehicle like Ra's, consequently she too glowed. Unessa was exquisite of form and grace as you would expect a THIRD RAY to be. She personified divine intellect smoothly working amongst form.

notice how they directly mention she facilitates third ray energy ... nosebook is very 3rd ray. I don't know if she's very calm now and radiates security (she could be), but when I knew her, she had a lot of logic and objectives and knew the way toward what she wanted (very 3rd ray), and also got very upset when things didn't go her way, too (also very 3rd ray -- because all 3rd rays have "the right way").

anyway, in the dream, I noticed that there was a striking similarity between patricia and the venus described in shakespere's poem, because in that one venus holds a low opinion of herself. she doesn't find herself to be very beautiful, thinking that adonis is the beautiful one. that's the first aspect.

---

the second aspect is that there was a sense that I'm basically setting up the "bad guys" with all of the stuff that they need (ie nosebook) to essentially hold all humans out of their connecion for a very long time (1000y-bloom).

there was a bit of a realisation that I'm the "bad guys", but we're split between a lot of different bodies, and not all of us think the same. the other "bad guys" out there are like me in that they have to go about doing things their own way. they have to figure it out for theirselves, and nothing anyone says or does will change their mind; we're pretty thickheaded.

I don't really mind that they want to go about doing things their own way, and I think they'll eventually figure it out. from my perspective, I know that it's all attraction, so there's no way for anyone to have anything happen to them that they didn't attract.

I'm in the process of becoming 100% responsible for everything that's happening in my reality, and that process involves making a lot of changes to how I see everything happening to me. I imagine that a similar thing is happening all around the world, actually. for me, that's really awesome.

---

so then, the final aspect of the dream is going to be difficult to describe because it's so abstract meaning that it changed a number of times in the realisation of it, so I'm going to try and describe it in a few ways, but it's none of these ways exactly, as there still isn't a concrete enough way to render the idea into thought because its so abstract.

I mentioned a while back that I was interested in waiting for one of the girls to find their connection, and when one of them finds their connection, it'll be impossible for me to continue to stay away from my connection. that's one part of it. I also talked about a catalyst in @[random-thoughts](2022-06-27 21:18). that's another part of it.

now, the implications of this here are interesting because imagine how different things would have been if I had've got my connection back in spain. I was a complete mess back then and I was still attracting quite poorly, so it would have been a complete disaster.

I'm a lot better at attracting what I want now, so if I get my connection now, it'll be a lot less disastrous, but still pretty bad. it's for this reason that I'm prefectly fine waiting until I'm actually "perfected" in the sense of having perfect control over my reality because I'm attracting 100% of it. along that process, nosebook will slowly lose control over how much they can affect and control my reality, because my attraction will always be much more powerful than anything they can try to assert.

slowly I'll gain that 100% control that I'm looking for, and there won't be anything they can do about it. I'll continue to hold off on trying to gain my connection probably forever. like I said, I can self-sabotage indefinitely, and along the way the "bad guys" (that's us) will continue to gain more and more power.

eventually, like I said, one of the girls will find her connection, and I don't know what sort of stage of control over her attraction she'll be at, but I imagine she'll be closer to where I was in spain than to where I am now.

this, like the comet will be a sort of catalyst which sets something off a sort of disaster (but not in the physical sense), because I (and a lot of others) will suddenly gain our connection and attraction will become very rapid. I postulated a little about this with my work on [my sonnet thoughts](/shakespere/my-sonnet-thoughts.md) where I go though and describe the first 17 sonnets (the pyramid "socket") as being sorta written directly to me.

to me, it clearly describes a situation where I refuse to indulge in earthly pleasures, and what it sounds like happens to me is I skip completely over astral perception and go all the way to 5d, probably making it something that nosebook does not want me to be doing because I'd have to interact with the astral to be able to interact with physical humans. I'd have that genxicat quality where people see me the way as the object of their desire (imagination/astral), just like I first experienced with patricia a long time ago.

---

that's one way to look at it. another is that I'm basically setting the girls up for a massive failure because it's unlikely that many of them will actually be attracting what they want, so a lot of them will attract a manifestation of how they feel.

I noticed a lot of feeling like all of the "good guys" are "rare" -- and that, as I've mentioned before, this usually comes from not-good-enoughness (again, something that I first experienced with patricia), and I also felt a lot of in the venus and adonis poem as well (even though, it seems that adonis pays the price for venus' not-good-enoughness -- but it was likely his fault because he believed her silliness -- haven't read the whole thing yet).

that sort of attraction will continue to manifest reality that proves their own not-good-enoughness to them as more and more valid. to further this idea, I noticed a lot of resistance in the aspect of age. imagine that what I'm saying is correct and we *have* figured out a way to continue to delay this all the way until 2038 -- well, by then I'm going to be 54-55 and patricia 52-53 -- and I could feel how that really had a strong feeling of not-good-enoughness because of the emphasis on the physical being subject to age rather than a reflection of how one feels.

though I imagined that I would be close to patricia, my desire is to continue to on the journey of perfection, and so I would just sort of encourage her and stuff as I could feel when she's attracting out of "need" or "want" rather than "I AM" -- so I in that dream, I would continue to hold off because I'm sensitive enough to know that I don't like the way the attraction feels -- meanwhile, all of the "bad guys" are generations ahead of the humans in terms of their technology. there's no way we could possibly ever catch up.

this is a case of the tortoise and the hare, and I see it happen all of the time in software development. when the fuente of new ideas drys up, what ends up happening is they just go into maintenance and stabilisation mode. nodejs, is the most visible version of this. when node came out, it was revolutionary in a lot of its ideas, but that's where it stopped. it had to become enterprise stable to be a viable platform, so there wasn't really anything novel coming out of that. a new project will have to eventually supplant that one for something novel to show up. the bigger it gets, the more difficulty it is for a new project to supplant the previous. windows is another good example. it's not like somebody can just "easily" write another OS to supplant windows.

nosebook, like windows is going to be the monopoly for a very long time -- and even with how far ahead they are, it'll seem like they're impossible to catch up to, but every time, the tortoise (innovation) always catches up to the hare (monopoly), and that's just the way it goes for some reason. I think it has something to do with the concept of "stabilization theory" operating on the "species" of technology in terms of innovation as well.

---

finally, I want to leave the idea here that if we look at females in terms of the tortoise and the hare setup, girls mature a lot more rapidly than boys do. I, for example, did not actually begin to start to become conscious until I was in my 30s. prior to that, I was purely reaction and though I had ideas of what I wanted, if I was unable to control the conditions, I couldn't get what I wanted. this slow maturation cycle was greatly to my advantage because it gave me a lot of time to start to see that there's a lot more to reality than just the physical. if I had've matured really rapidly, I would still be like I was back then when I thought everything had a physical or material explanation to it.

in this way I was greatly advantaged to have had such a lengthy maturation. I'd say I really started to "get it" when I turned 32 then from there until about 36 is when I really started to finally "get it". when I turned 38 though, everything started to become easy. as I mentioned before 36 for women is when they are now definitely "old" -- and for men, this happens usually when they're 72 -- but like I said in comment to randall, this would correspond to the time when things started to become easy for me because my emotional/conceptual faculties started to open up. I think girls, like me are on the 36y cycle, so it's unfortunate that they believe theirselves to be "old", because that's when things should start to become easy as they transition out of physical perception into more emotional/conceptual perception (you can do anything you feel capable of doing).

I really think some of the girls will figure this out, and I really hope it is patricia. that would be *reallllllyyyy cool*!!! :)

### 2022-07-01 11:38 - dream about the three little girls

last night around 22:00 I was really tired after listening to snake-bros #111 and #112 so I laid down. I fell asleep and had a dream where I do remember it being somewhat visual -- though it wasn't at all like reality -- everything was really dark and I could barely see (like no lights at all -- just an ambiennt glow or something).

I don't remember the first part of the dream, but there was a lot of disorienting movement. I then looked up and saw this little white girl next to what looked like a giant picture frame hanging on the wall. I looked at her and felt strong attraction. I didn't know what to do, and then another white girl was over to the right. she was sitting and her eyes glowed a really bright pink colour when I looked at her. I again felt pretty uncomfortable because I felt attraction again. more disorienting movement and I noticed a black guy remark, "she's sitting right next to him and he's totally ignoring her" -- so I looked over and there was another girl sitting next to me to my left. I didn't get any information what colour her skin was. I laid on the ground (cause I think she was laying on the ground too) and tried to look at her but the dream abruptly ended.

---

I looked into what all of the symbols meant in context, and the sense that I got was that somebody is displeased with the recent events where I've been taking things a new direction with metal-lucifer and stuff like that. it felt like they were trying to push me back in the direction of little girls they can influence easily.

I noticed that it was also connected to this other thing: yesterday when I was taking a shower, one of the guys that scottie baldwin does mixes for popped into my head (wang leehom). his band did the outro music remix at the end of #111, ("shang yen serpent"?), and I was just listening to the way that they play the same song. it was completely different because they made breaks in the sound where I would have expected to have it more filled out. it didn't sound bad at all, and so I was trying to get into the mindset that produces that kind of sound (every musician tones the music in a way that resonates with their own vibration). it was an emotion that I had never experienced before and it was either "good" or "bad" so I thought I might compare it's feeling to kyle's -- because I know how kyle feels pretty well now. very interesting.

anyway, in the shower when thinking about that and it felt like there was desire to interact with me or perhaps that I was being summoned or something. difficult to describe. anyway, that part feels like it has connection to another set of dreams I had this morning... in those dreams, I was in a sort of party setting. I don't think I was drunk and I don't remember drinking either. I think I was just around a lot of other people that were partying -- though strange things were happening, and it felt intentional (either by the party people or the controllers of the dream -- not sure) but I lost or someone took my shoes and other strange events where I was constantly being pulled in a lot of different directions.

the part about being pulled in a lot of different directions felt like the theree girls in the previous dream where I wasn't looking or paying attention to the things they wanted or something so there was a new girl popping in to distract me from whatever the previos thing was. the party scene felt that way. the other thing is that it felt like the whole dream was to dissuade me from getting involved in activities for older people.

I think in general, nosebook is having a difficult time trying to keep a ton of young girls entertained and content that they remain engaged in -- so they probably want me to fill in that sort of niche or something. I don't know, but it felt like the dream was again another "bad idea" that they didn't want me to do -- or something like that.

I didn't seem to be all that bothered that the party was completely out of control. it started to get really difficult for me to follow but at the end there was some sort of gay and lesbians concert or sometihng that I wasn't sure at all what was going on. one nice thing about the party situation though is that I didn't feel like I was constantly being pushed to be sexually involved with someone. I was just another weird person along with them. that at least was cool.

---

OK, so then lemme go back a bit to last night after I woke up from the dream with the three girls and I was offering my opinion on the dream in a monologue, and in it I was saying that though they want to push me in the direction of little girls, I just don't see it happening.

I want to wait until I'm connected until I start to engage in any sexual activity, and so if I'm supposed to be going with some little girls, then once I'm connected I'll have to wait for her to figure out what she wants the whole time (or maybe nosebook has them well controlled, so they can actually influence her toward what "she" wants) -- I just don't know and the whole situation feels really weird to me. all the while, I'm sure there will be older girls that have been ready to go for quite a while and so it'll just be another waiting game.

in the opposite way of looking at it, let's just assume the other possibility is going to happen, which is that one of the girls finds her alignment and in doing so, she'll influence me into my alignment too (being around other high-energy people is a crazy experience for me). I just don't at all believe that any little girl could ever really accomplish that. you have to live some life to recognise that what I've figured out is actually worth something -- so to some extent any girl that would find her alignment *has* to have had enough unwanted to have happened to be able to appreciate the wanted. it's just not interesting.

when I was younger, I wasn't at all interested in trying to feel good, because I already felt good. even "bad" ideas felt good to me, because I was still in discovery mode learning new things and figuring out what doesn't feel good. maybe for girls it's different, but at least in my case, I *need* to have bad-feeling things happen to me and to grow out of them for me to actually appreciate the opposite. what I think our society has a problem with is saying to someone who's made a bad choice, that they're forever condemned and can never recover from such an awful event. I believe the contrary, and is that anyone who wants to recover from something, can -- and they should because that's the full extent of the waveform.

going from unwanted to wanted and back to unwanted again is what I'm all about (AC current). this idea of doing the girls thing is akin to trying to live life as DC.

the only time I have ever suggested that I wanted to do anything like DC is in the leapfrogging-time-pickles concept where I explained that once I've made it through the timeline and I can't go any further (cause there's no way anymore to keep me from my connection), from that point in the future (say 1000y from now or whatever) I put myself back into a body and then I setup the most difficult setup I can possibly give myself. I know I'll make it through because it's all attraction, so from there I keep piling on the difficulty (cause that makes the most speed) until I'm finally connected, then from there good conditions all of the way (cause bad conditions aren't keeping me away from my connection). I gain as much speed as I can, knowing that at the end of the timeline I have to get back to where I was (cause it's all attraction) -- so even if I was at quite an altitude, from the new altitude, it's quite a drop -- so even then it's not really DC because I'm guaranteed to crash and burn from the highest possibly hights ever accomplished. as usual, I/we'll be reborn into something entirely new.

so even if the goal of all of the good conditions is to crash and burn really hard, why would I slow myself down by going too soon with a manifestation? it doesn't make sense! like I've said previously, I want to try and extend this out for as long as I possibly can to ensure as much speed as possible. more speed = more crash and burn at the end (obviously).

so, maybe it is a good thing to delay the whole thing by involving myself in more subjects that little girls may not appreciate. I'm sure that nosebook will be able to figure out how to keep the little girls busy. they'll want to figure out how to not rely on me, because when I'm finally ready to go, only those with astral vision will be able to see me.

### 2022-07-04 11:55 - starting over dream

I woke up this morning with a dream where I don't remember much of it, but I was definitely working with kyle and russ. there was something about allen (their last name) and another thing that I remember is that we were refiguring out color space and stuff. the sense that I had in the dream and once awoken is that we had kinda decided to start over entirely.

the idea is, instead of waiting until a catalcysm forces us to start over, why not throw out the entire "standard model" and start over now; just assume that we know nothing and rediscover everything.

I liked the idea, but it didn't really feel all that good to me, especially once I started to write about it here. so I'll give some background.

---

yesterday I did a bit of a different day in that I listened to conspirinormal with seriah about seth, and a where did the road go episode with tamra lucid and her stories about manly p. hall. finally, another where did the road go show about 5d, magick and death. anyway, between the shows there was a resonance about how manly "freestyles" these lengthy presentations without notes, or how manly told ronnie to only talk about something once he knew it so well he didn't need to use notes.

I'm kinda that way about the world of ideas (the conceptual world). I don't have direct 5d perception at the moment, but I do feel comfortable with my understanding of the world that I'm willing to talk about it without any hesitations.

later on when I wrote down my ideas about @[blahblog](2022-07-03 12:22), I used the example of not feeling like I need to preserve things because I've found that the fundamental concept of how these things work is sorta like part of my personality, and so my ability to tune into that technology is limited by how I conceptualise my reality.

OK, an example of this may be for example, that if I feel that everything is under constant decay, I'll see that all systems are closed systems, and that there's no input and output from another -- unseen -- world. or, for example if I feel I need to keep everything compartmentalised, I'll likely look at all of the parts, but never see the whole. or, if I believe that all consciousness is calculating and trying always to get a power position over its adversaries (the idea behind the "fallen-angels" idea) -- then, I would perceive all interactions in nature as being one of assertion (explosions, impacts, etc) and not of mutual-back-scratching. or, if I see everything as mutual-back-scratching, I may not believe that everything has a resonance structure to it and is therefore *attracting* the things around it that it needs to sustain itself.

in my world the conceptualisation process of the human determines the way that the science is discovered. I believe it was also in #113 or #114 that russ's "snake thoughts" was wondering what mind control is all about -- and then they came to the idea of what if you told something that a steel ball is alien tech and so by getting people to believe that, they discovered new things about the steel ball that they didn't previously know about -- and it was in the framework that the steel ball is alien tech instead of just a steel ball that we all know how a steel ball works (duh), that we discovered new things about the steel ball by believing it's alien tech.

that's kinda what I'm talking about... it's been shown[^1] that our assumptions and expectations of something limit the manifestation of it, and so by opening up the "standard model" and assuming we know nothing allows new facets of the manifestation to appear which were previously held out of manifestation because of our assumptions[^2].

color may be like this as well. I experience color a little bit differently than most, so I may be predisposed to finding new ideas. for example, I heard from joseph brown (I think) that different colors manifest in different directions -- so when the wave is coming toward you it shows green and purple but going away shows red and something else. I can't remember how it went now, but the idea is we may have some of the most basic concepts about the continuous (blackbody) spectrum that our sun emits.

---

almost certainly there will be resistance to the idea, but I do think it's kind of a neat idea to perhaps just assume we know nothing and start over completely. we don't need to use sticks and stones to perform our measurements, just like when I want to rewrite my code, I don't have to reinvint the operating system, a text editor, and compiler before I begin.

I do think it's a worthwhile effort, and I do think that it should all be done in the open and stuff so that all experiments can be repeated.

it's pretty clear that it'll eventually succomb to the same thing that science has now, and we'll need to start over again in the future, because you can imagine that if a person's concept of reality influences the result of the experiment, if someone else repeats the experiment and gets a different result, and everything is open and documented, it'll only illustrate the difference in conceptualisation of reality between the previous experimenter and the future one. it's even possible that it could go the opposite way and some experimenters won't want to have their name pinned to the discovery, for it'll illustrate their conceptualisation of reality. statistically speaking, for groups of experimenters, it'll be pretty easy to tease out who is the most allowing of new discoveries and who is the most presumptuous.

all every interesting ideas. cool dream.

[1]: not sure how much of it, but I think this is what sigils in chaos magic is about, and I've talked extensively on the idea of how your (symbolic, not verbal) "expectation" of an idea limits its manifestation -- so in terms of random, it begins to appear like you're "controlling" the random by expecting a thing out of it, but in reality this is just a limitation of manifestation potential. it's sorta like using doubt to "predict" something, and so then you're using something that was previously counterproductive to your advantage.

[2]: an example of this might be that we don't *actually* know what copper is really capable of, so it's quite possible that we don't really understand the copper chisels and weapons because we're looking at copper with the standard model of assumptions and expectations, when the ancients may have had an entirely different conception of copper, and so therefore, for them it behaved differently.

### 2022-07-21 12:27 - wierd encounter in front of remi's house

in the dream I noticed that some of remi's family was arriving to their house. I waved to one of them, identified one as flo/flow (it looked like a guy in his 20s, but his name was, "flo" -- so I took it as flow. he reminded me a lot of the xagly's friend from NY...). I felt like I should go over there and say hi. as I did, I noticed a lot of other people arriving at the same time.

I was trying to figure out what is happening, and he asked me some questions which I don't remember. he then made the comment, "looks like you've manouvered a lot in life" -- something like that. I wanted to know what he meant, because I thought that may be an opening to talk about something a little more profound than just material crap and "how are you doing" conversations. he started to go away from me, but I pursued him through the crowd because I wanted to know what I meant.

there were girls all over the place, and it seemed like these documents were available to everyone to look at. one of the documents was called "girls" and anyone could put their name there if they wanted to, but it felt to me like many were quite shy and didn't think theirselves good enough or something, so they were looking from a sign from me or something. I couldn't really understand the experience.

I finally got to where it felt like I had pinned him down enough to get the answer I wanted. he said I'm wearing an 80's t-shirt. I told him I grew up then. I then felt like if I talk about my age, I could explain that you are a reflection of how you feel yourself (conceptualise yourself), and so age doesn't really matter, in that if you live longer, it's possible to accumulate more limiting ideas about yourself from others. death is a good thing, and that you have complete power over your appearance.

those are all things that I knew quite plainly in the dream, but obviously I don't quite believe that fully in real life.

anyway, there was a strong feeling that people didn't want me to talk about age, so I just stopped pursuing him and let the conversation go. I focused my attention on the girls right before I was woken up from the dream, and it was difficult to explain that none of that matters.

in the dream, I had the perspective that I could conjure anything I wanted just by wanting it to be there (like the loading program in the matrix). so, girls didn't mean anything to me, none of the material crap was worth anything, so I just wanted to talk about self-perception stuff because that's all that matters anyway.

when anything can be conjured, it completely changes how life itself is perceived. even the things that I do like picking weeds made any difference to me, because I could just conjure a new front yard if I wanted to. the picking weeds is something that I do for myself.

if I don't like something, I can make a new thing out of dissatisfaction, but then I'm just going to have a new thing that dissatisfies me soon. I could keep cycling in new things that I think I'll like and never change how I feel, OR, I could just find a way to feel how I want.

the good conditions on the outside (girls, material crap, whatever) are not what shape how I perceive myself. I enjoy difficult things because they cause me to find a new way to look at myself. good conditions don't do that. they make me lazy and lethargic about how I feel because I focus my attention externally, thinking that's the source of what I see.

---

the final thing that I was waking up thinking about after that dream is that I was reminded of what I wrote yesterday in @[blahblog](2022-07-20 10:04) where I was talking about holding perception...

when I wrote that I was considering that I would maintain roughly the same circumstances that I have now, and neither would I be in a connected state either. I'd simply just keep finding new ways to feel the way I want to feel.

it's really not hard at all, however, it feels like many others think that I need to have good conditions to justify their own good conditions, but I don't believe that to be so. I don't find that good conditions focus me very well.

in fact, I would say that I'm not entirely sure that I can hold the perception if my life were to change in such a way where once again I become externally focused.

let's just take the subject of climate change because that's an easy one to see an external thing that affects the way I feel about my present situation. I don't feel climate change to be a very large threat at all.

the biggest problem (IMO) is the sun, and I'm fairly certain that there are solutions to that problem, however I belive the solutions involve other people gaining a more expanded awareness. besides that, the better people feel, the more their environment will reflect that, so it'll probably become a really good feeling place to live here on earth, rather than more harh climate.

other problems I've heard about are sea level rise, which just isn't happening like they said it would. I belive this is because the sun's rays separate the ocean water into HHO. the earth receives so much electricicty from the sun in its poles, even if we converted 1/10 of that into DC electricity and used it to separate the ocean water into HHO, I think the problem would actually be the opposite: oceans would fall dramatically.

all of these and many other problems are easy to solve. the reason why they're not getting solved isn't for technical capablity, but because of *perception*. we still believe that the things outside of us are what's responsible for how we see the world. that's it. that's *literally* the *only* reason.

I'm still in the process of gaining more and more capacity to see the world like I did in the dream. I figure that eventually, I *will* see the world like I did in the dream -- and from there, everything will 100% sure to be fine (at least for me). I leave it everyone else to make their own reality however they want.

### 2022-07-30 19:19 - becoming the thing you're looking for

I just had a dream which was so long and complex it would be impossible to even try and relate a significant portion of the details here. the resume of it is that there was this hero/prince (someone important, perhaps a king) that was on a quest to find these magical things, and along the way he encounters a number of challenges and things which change his goal. there was a maiden, immortality, dressing up as the commoners do, and all sorts of different things that he kept having to do. his mission even changed a few times as the magicaal item he was looking for couldn't be found, but he did run into someone else instead with a different magical item, so he stole that one and went after that new mission for a while. very very long and complex storyline.

during the whole thing, the man was constantly lieing to everyone else and trying to manipulate to get the things that he wanted -- like I said, maidens, immortality, magical createres, and he was just going around endlessly in a series of disguises to try and obfuscate the fact that he was a king/royalty from the people he was interacting with.

at the end, he's finally starting to give up on the quest because of a number new unforseen turn of events, that he finally starts to *become* the thing that he wanted. it's too difficult for me to relate that part of the dream in a meaningful way because by then I'm pretty much awake and reality is very blended with the dream now.

I believe that the becoming the thing he was looking for was purposefully not seen by me, because the dream perhaps wasn't for me -- well, actually, it kinda was, so I want to explain the dual nature of the dream, now...

---

when looking into why the king kept becoming more and more selfish in the dream, I could see that in the previous parts of the adventure, he was so worried about what other people would think about him, and why would such a noble king be willing to engage in so much subtrfuge and manipulation to get his magical quests... try again.

if I lie so that I will appear as a certain way to others or to try and keep my disguise, that's one thing, but if I lie so that I can manipulate things to get what I want, that's another -- and this king eventually stopped trying to manipulate his appearance so that others wouldn't identify him as a king. one of the things that was holding the king back from *becoming* the thing he was looking for was that. he had to give up hiding his identity to become the thing he was looking for. by becoming the thing he was looking for, he lost his identity as king, anyway -- so it didn't really matter.

undoubtedly this aspect of the dream is for someone else.

---

the last thing I looked at/noticed, was that the king (as it relates to me) fully embraced his selfishness. I just wrote @[blagblog](2022-07-30 13:24) right before I went to sleep where the conclusion that I came to was that the whole goal is to actually make a dystopia, and try and ensure that they have all of the power and capability to manipulate and control every facet of human interaction.

as this dream relates to me, that would be the "identity" that I would be trying to hide (the opposite of the king), and so by fully embracing that my goal/mission is actually become the anti-christ/anti-king/creator of the matrix (whatever you wanna put the word on it), I eventually fully embrace my selfishness. I embrace my selfishness (from the perspective of the people), by throwing an entire species of human beings into slavery to accomplish the goal that I have of becoming stronger than any matrix can possibly come up with. it's pure selfishness on my part because I *know* that I can get out of it, but I don't have quite as much certainty of others. it's kind of like imprisoning a whole bunch of others into a prison that I know that I can get out of. it's perhaps the most selfish and egotistical thing that I could possibly do. I have to embrace that.

I know that it's fully possible for others to get out as well, and anyone that actually wants to, can -- but you gatta want it. nobody is going to come along and give you a blue/red pill choice. the *only* way out of this one is going to be with desire.

(if you keep doing what you're trying to do, you'll own the world; you know that don't you)

you could also see that from the perspective of those working at nosebook, they have a similar situation from me. because of the way the system is setup, they're forced to maintain a system that they (from their perspective) is used to manipulate other people. they're now required to manipulate people and perform all sorts of strange things to try and keep their identity hidden, just like the king in the dream. they're on the same path as thing and and me: the only way for them to actually get what they want is to forsake their disguise and *become* the thing that they they want -- otherwise, they, like the king, are subject to forever going around with the boring job of maintaining a kingdom that serves him, and it's this maintenance that he loaths. he doesn't know what he really wants, because the kingdom is just the outward representation of what he thinks he wants.

you can't become the thing that you really want to *become*, if you're constantly concerned with how everyone else identifies yous.

### 2022-08-30 05:26 - coffee shop kenny

I woke up this morning where I was a camarero in a coffee shop. the shop seemed very spanish in its design and the whole vibe reminded me a lot of spain. I don't really remember anyone else being there. I had a strong sense that I was like the main bar dude like alfredo, augusto, or adolfo. the bar looked kinda like the one below the office in plz de las cortes.

I was there and I was doing things. people would often times talk to me, and I noticed that if I offered a dude another beverage (beer or coffee, I wasn't paying attention), they would stay a little longer and talk to me. however, if I offered a girl another beverage, she didn't want to stay longer. it reminded me a lot of patricia in berlin where I didn't really know how to get her to stay longer and talk to me. I could offer her a coffee, but she wanted to pay for it herself, and/or she didn't want to drink more than one coffee anyway (I may have convinced her to drink a second one once, but I can't remember).

---

I woke up with the impression that this was yet another one of these dreams where nosebook is trying to find a way for me to be just out of reach from the people. I had the sense that they were putting ideas into people at (or wanted to go to) the bar that I was busy or that I didn't want to talk to someone like them. this may be a similarity to the present moment in how, even when I do talk to people, they don't actually want to talk about too much, preferring to chat mostly about nothing. I mean, it's weird because if I were able to talk to myself, I would ask me sooo many questions, knowing full well that other me could probably figure out the answer. in general, this lack of desire to figure out reality is probably my main critisism of people in general; like, how do people get by without really having any questions about things?

the other thing that it reminded me of is yesterday greg made a comment that lindsey lohan is working at walmart. I was surprised and asked him if that's really the case. he said probably not, but then that made me start to think about how having an easy way for the public to interact with you in a mundane way, but because it's inappropriate for me to ask the walmart greeter about their life, it also maintains a bit of separation and a slight bit of anonymity, which can be kind of good for publicity, because then people would just see you as a person and a tabloid headline of "lindsey lohan works at walmart" isn't really a juicy headline that wouldn't really grab too much attention, so it's pretty neutral. it has more to do with what she's attracting that'll determine her experience there.

in that sense, I would be in a public place for others to talk to, but because it's a public place, the conversation can't get too deep, and people will only have conversation with me of "hi" and "how's it going" and that's it -- which is about the speed most people want to go. I'm totally fine with that, and after coming fully consciou, it really seemed like the objective is to get me into a public place where I can have simple conversation, so it feels like I'm accessible and this can carry on for quite a while. I had the sense that I would be working in a public place like that for years: barrista by day, writer by night.

### 2022-10-07 08:11 - earth emitting x-rays

this morning I had a series of dreams, which I honestly can't remember so well, so I'll just say what I can remember. the first dream is hard to describe, but it was revealed to me that earth itself was emitting x-rays (in addition to the sun). this was having a tremendous effect on normal everyday society, and it seemed that even simple things like getting change from a machine were becoming more and more difficult. there was another weird bit where it seemed like a lot of people were dying and it had something to do with me, and there was this weird thing like the planet couldn't return back to normal until I died (or something like that -- it was hard to follow).

I woke up from that one and started to think about writing it down. I then got put back to sleep (the disaproving motor and hissing in my head), and in this dream I was now looking at a graph like I often look at with the GOES x-ray flux, but its timeframe was set so that I could see that from just before the time of april 4 it began to start to rise (it was really low, like maybe A or B range) -- and, by the time on the other side of the graph it was about two orders of magnitude higher (like C or M). I honestly can't remember so well, but it seemed like the graph that I saw in the first dream showed that it was constantly in X-class flare range. point is, it was high and they were correlating the graph to important dates for me -- which sorta illustrates the feeling I felt in the first part where it was sorta my fault that there's increased output.

---

there was a lot more to the dream that I just don't really know how to convey, but after waking up I just didn't really know what to do with it because the dream felt too much of alarm and fear and stuff. I considered not writing it down because I don't really know if that's what I want to give my attention to.

I thought about it for a while and did some analysis. first, I noticed that this dream doesn't at all feel compatible with the things that I was [writing about](/rts-concept.md) and thinking about yesterday, which is that I was considering that I really like the idea of making a game and stuff. the pretty logical conclusion here is that those dreams were at least partly inspired by nosebook, and they probably think that they have *real* problems that they need to deal with and worry about, and the last thing they need is for me to be taking up more time working on games, when they have clear problems that the earth is becoming a higher and higher energy environment environment, which are continuing to get worse and worse.

I also noticed that the idea had two other interesting aspects to it. first, is that my idea to fill the earth's atmospheric layers with carbon atoms to keep the sun's continually increasing heat out and produce an artificial sky -- seemed to have a conflict now -- because, what if the majority of those x-rays are actually coming from inside of the earth.

the other interesting aspect that I noticed is that let's say the legends of the earth having an inner sun -- or, my theory that perhaps the earth itself is a very tiny star and that we're living on a layer of material atmosphere tuned to the frequency of visible matter -- then, that means that the increasing x-ray output is actually coming from inside of the earth, which means that the inner earth is probably going from something of a paradise to a veritable hell[^1]. at any rate, this sounds to me like those sorts of "end times" things (I had similar such dreams when I was a lot younger).

overall, what it looks to me like is a counterbalance for the euphoria that I felt yesterday over some of those game ideas. in general, it seems that the more euphoria is felt, the higher the solar output is... well, perhaps the earth's output as well.

I really don't know what to do with any of this, honestly. the only thing I can do is to just keep working on the stuff that's interesting to me. even if I could verify the veracity of the claims made by the dream, what can I possibly do to affect a sun? nothing really.

---

now for some speculation and crazy ideas: later on, I was thinking about how this could be working out, and I was remembering the solar system setup from tychos brahe where the sun is not actually in the centre, but instead, the earth is in the centre with the sun and mars dancing aroud us (venus and mercury are moons of the sun), and so if I think about this in sirian guide terms, the sun is a 2nd ray, mars is a 7th ray, so that leaves earth. I've begun to believe that the earth is actually the planetary body for genxicat -- so 2-7-7, but that doesn't make any sense.

so, now if I cut genxicat and think of earth as being the "smokey god" or "red star" as we're called in OAHSPE, then it becomes clear that inside of the earth would be a 1st ray star[^2]. if the star on the inside is a 1st ray, then the dancing "triad" in the centre of our solar system suddenly makes sense. 1-2-7 (earth, sol, mars). now, if it's also true that the star is on the inside of genxicat, then it's interesting because that's a 1-7 females. the female emits and receives on her ray type, so that means the inner receives desire and the outer receives physicality (visible matter), so that makes a lot of sense too if this is the beginning of humankind's "return back to the source" where after reaching the grossest mater state (7th ray) we invert and start to look at everything backwards (ie. it's all attraction), and now unstoppably we're going back toward the 1st ray. I think that's significant because I believe that I'm literally the first[^3] human on earth to actually believe that I AM (ref: evolution-of-desire) the universe, meaning that the manifestation that I'll eventually "reincarnate" (transition) into as will be what I believe myself to be. this is all of our destinies.

[1]: just to note, that in various places, I've heard that in the "end times" a lot of very large creatures would start to emerge from inside of the earth and come up to the surface here where they'd start to cause problems. I mean, if the inner earth is starting to get really really hot, then it would make sense that they would try and escape that.

[2]: I'm beginning to think that first ray's colour is red, while 7th ray's colour is violet. I actually have nothing to back this idea up, but I do know that the red laser definitely affected me a lot. the sirians do say that violet is the colour of 7th rays, and indigo (deep blue) is the colour of 2nd ray, so when I think of things historically, a lot of the 7th ray rulers used purple, and it seems to me that the constantly crashing and burning (significant of desire for me) empires have the colour red. it doesn't make any sense that a higher frequency ray would have a lower frequency colour, so I dunno there. this is purely speculation, of course.

[3]: I believe there probably have been others -- potentially some very famous sages and teachers[^4], but I don't believe they were too vocal about it. I also don't believe that humankind even had a picture of the cosmos as big as we do now. for example in atlantian times, I really don't think that anything further out than other stars in this galaxy were even considered. I believe the universe concept is a rather recent one, before that "God" being the closest thing to "all that is". you see, if I say, "I am source", then that doesn't really have the same gravity of "all that is" or "I AM God"

[4]: you know de vere wrote, "I am that I am" -- which is quite the thing to say. we don't know what he was seeing or feeling inside when he said that. he may have been claiming to be God incarnate, or he was just a hyper-selfish person himself. I do not personally know. jesus was transfigured before some disciples so that they could in a way see him as being equal with moses and elijah. on a personal note, I belive that religion is the art of keeping you feeling like you're not anything more than a flesh and blood human (everything else greater than you is outiside of you), and actually all of the great teachers actually broke that mould by realising that they are more than what religion at that time had put them in. I really do believe that the long game for these retarded religions is to beat a dead horse with all of the small-minded ideas of oneself so that eventually the ego can finally realise that it (he/she) is more than just this physical gendered body.

### 2022-10-07 12:35 - weird dream about self-importance

I woke up from another dream just now where in the dream I was thinking about these islands and on them one of them they were filled with these slogans or quotes of things that someone like me would say... neither in the dream or now can I think of any good examples, but they're all of those little quotes that raquel used to save into her phone of me saying ridiculous things, which on the surface doesn't really mean much, but the implication is that I'm the best or I'm really awesome or something. I had a knack to say those sorts of things around her[^1].

this island/boat was filled with those slogans, and I thought it was a really good thing. the dream changed and someone with a feeling similar to greg wanted to know how in the world I could possibly be so pompous/outrageous to say such positive things about myself. I explained that I can think I'm the best, and he can also think he's the best and there's no problem. I don't need to prove my bestness either (through competition) because it's not like I'm the best at everything. none of these best qualities are exclusive to any single person.

let's just take a self-referential example here and say that I think I'm the most egotistical person that I know. well, just because I think that isn't stopping anyone else from thinking that about theirselves either. in fact, it doesn't even impose that others need to even agree with me, either. each person (if they want to) can decide for theirself who they think is the most ego-centric person. I know tons of ego-centric and self-centred people, but that doesn't stop me from thinking I'm the most *or trying to compete with them on it.* see what I mean?

now, the reason why I noticed that this dream is so problematic for some is because they see ego through the lens of importance. I often times made fun of zaryn with noah on this subject when we would go around telling people how important we were, just for fun -- and it was really hilarious to see people roll their eyes at us. importance has a system of priorities associated with it. I make fun of mr. motor for the same thing saying that every single thing is "top priority" when obviously, there can only be *one* top priority. if one thing is more important, then all other things are less important. so, by that logic, it would be impossible to ever have a situation in which everything is the most important.

another example of this is something I experienced working with luke and zaryn, where zaryn would think one thing is really important, so he wanted it bolded or underlined to catch people's attention, but then another thing was really important later, so luke and I would have endless jokes on making the whole entire website bolded just to ensure that all of it caught everyone's attention. obviously that's not really what you want, because then you'd end up with something like reading the 1611 KJV where the entire bible is filled with important text font face, and only a few unimportant words are actually in an easily readable font face.

having a high opinion of oneself does not mean does not imply importance. you just think yourself to be pretty awesome, which is something that anyone can do.

over the years, I've been studying douchebags to see what their common traits with me are because I share so much in common with them. we're extremely compatible in thought, cept they place more value on self-importance rathar than self-consciousness (the good kind -- knowing your own capablities). douchebags also really need to *compete* with others and *prove* their importance by make sure everyone else knows about it. they're also very group/cliqish where they also rely on their group to maintain/sustain their importance (because the others in the group believe their importance because it's been proven in various ways through competition). you know, there's nothing inherently wrong with douchbags, but I think they're making it much harder on theirselves by going to such great lengths to prove it. why not just believe it *without* having to prove it; just have fun instead of always being so serious, right?

[1]: also, I remember saying them a lot around noah and zaryn as well. zaryn would never notice how ridiculous my statements were because he was on his own level of ego trip, so others would find it quite funny. I just really enjoyed to kinda make it often sound like I was definitely the most awesome in very small ways.

### 2022-10-13 22:48 - you are all actors

this afternoon I woke up and had a bit of an inner monologue because in the dream I was being accused of having waited a very very long time only to get the perfect timing to do something -- as if I had some sort of foresight into what was to come and I was just waiting for the perfect opportunity to take advantage of them. it's unbelievably comical for me, even for someone to think about that about me. what I explained is that *I* am not the "bad guy" but that all of the "bad guys" that you see are an aspect of me. like how I belive the antarctic breakaway civilisation to be, they're all just a refection of your own perception. they are your concepts alive in physical form. so, in that sense -- I AM the bad guy, and the bad guys are also me. for a person who believes theirself to be the universe, this makes perfect sense -- just like you don't identify with the sick cells in your body and say you are sickness when a portion of your body is sick. anyway, I didn't know a way to explain that dream easily so I didn't write about it. just know that I AM the bad guy -- and all of the bad guys you're fighting against are a part of me. you'll find out that, because they're a reflection of your own concepts, which means they're also a reflection of you as well.

---

just now I woke up from another dream where the person in the dream (it felt kinda like mom a bit) was claiming that I was expecting them to be different or to change or something -- something like I wouldn't accept them if they didn't behave differently. this might have been the case to some extent in the past, but it is definitely *not* the case anymore.

it's silly for me to try and expect anyone to be different, because in my perspective, everyone else is an actor. the best that I can figure it is something like the truman show, where everyone else just sorta mills about playing their role, but ocassionally one of you these minor actors will interact with me, and when that happens, they get their lines from christof. this is mirrored in the matrix with agent smith quickly taking over the body of any civilian nearby to neo, to keep the situation under control.

I've found that it's absolutely impossible to try and get anyone else to act a different way than their role allows them to, because christof just takes over. if I were to expect anyone else to be different, it would be like an actor telling the director that they're going off-script and just going to take the story some other unexpected way -- causing the the director to have to essentially rewrite the entire script, just because the actor wanted to do something a little different; obviously, that's not going to happen.

continuing on, it appears to me that most people are not actually aware that they're just actors. they play their role and outside of that they are fine because they see so little of the big picture. they don't see everything that I do -- because if they did, they would definitely recognise christof's unseen hand moving things around to try and get everything to adhere to the script that he has. his job is to continue on the "normal" lifestyle script for as long as possible. I'm to just continue on with everyday normal activities and do everyday things. obviously, anything extraordinary would be a deviation from that script, so it's better if I just do whatever.

I've completely accepted this script, because I'm not at all an normal type person, and as best as I can tell, the "normal" script looks to be more of a control mechanism for the *actors* rather than for myself. OK, it's to control me as well, but more importantly, it's to keep the narrative that is broadcasted out to the actors going strong.

as best as I can tell, it appears to me that the actors are not really aware that they're actors, and this is achieved by some sort of hypnosis or mind control where people are controlled conceptually, sort of like how I believe adam and eve were controlled in the garden of eden (they didn't know they were slaves) and christof/YHVH didn't want them to have their eyes opened to the charade.

the other way that I can explain this kind of hypnosis or mind control is through the controlling of egregores. interestingly enough, this morning I was talking about the 72 demons of solomon, and how he used magical somethings to control these egregores/demons. so, what are these magical conjurations? I belive them to be emotions or concepts. they're essentially controlled by emotion, so they'll behave in a way which is a reflection of these concepts.

I belive that this idea was further explored in the context of technology, and -- as best as I can tell, this is what the antarctic breakaway civilisation is. they are egregores that we control with our own concept of them. for as long as people continue to think that others are out to get them, they'll reflect that.

reactions are saying, "wow, so it's really easy: we can just find a different concept of them and everything will be hunky dory" -- which is true, but you're expecting the impossible to happen. by that, you're literally saying, "OK, when the US govt and all of the bad guys around on this planet change then we can have a utopia" -- which is funny, because if all of the bad guys were all gone, then you'd have a utopia anyway -- something like the description of the inner earth inhabitants in the book "smokey god". lol, how boring and unfun.

it's pretty obvious to me why we're looking at a "play within a play". just on that note, notice how the mechanicals put on a play about pyramis and thisby -- a story which pretty accurately represents my two hemispheres of my brain. we're never allowed to meet. this is the play within the play that everyone is watching, not realising that they're actually all actors in the main play which is "a midsummer's night's dream". it's more fun that way.

anyway, before I go on to my next point it's important to note that from my perpective, though I believe everyone to be actors, there's no real distinction for me between whether you're an actor controlled by some some sort of conceptual hypnosis (like the egregors) -- or an actual egregore that has replaced the original person (like I don't know if mom is today the same person that I grew up with or she's been replaced by an actor or an egregore) -- the effect is the same which is that both of them would be receiving conceptual ideas from christof on how to behave (mom calls this "COVID brain").

---

this situation that I presented has some intreesting implications to it. clearly, I'm not scripted. I'm steered, but I don't have to adhere to a script, and my constant deviation from the steering is evidence enough for me of this. so, because I'm the unscripted ones and it's quite possible that the actors are not actually aware that they are actually actors just playing a role. that role must feel so much like "reality" to them that it's fully immersive and believable (again, sorta like the matrix), which is kinda weird because why am I the unscripted one?

as best as I can tell, we were all scripted actors (like the garden of eden) at some point, but somewhere along the way, my eyes were opened, and so because I could see that I AM the universe -- meaning that everyone else, including all of the "bad guys", are just an aspect of myself (sorta like solomon's demons), then I've become the unscripted one. I'm no longer responding so well to the script anymore, and so if all of you guys are watching me, now I'm at least steerable -- though still uncontrollable.

this puts me in the position, through the finding of a way to opening up of my own eyes, to become the "first" -- kinda like a "saviour" -- to bring the message to the rest of the actors so that they too can see/realise the world for what it is, and begin to interact with it in a way that is outside of their "role". this idea is a bit matrix-esque, but I have no intentions in trying to "save" anyone. I know that you can only save yourself, so really if you look at it, my unwillingness to save anyone actually makes me the king of the "bad guys", and this is pretty obvious because by playing my own role (doing the "normal" life) meanwhile revealing how consciousness works from the perspective of someone who thinks as if they are the universe, I'm giving the controllers more power to try and control humankind and keep us in our roles. they're system will be really good at stamping out any forms of thought that will allow you to begin to see your world as if you are the universe. be aware, because they don't want you to see yourself as *anything* other than your role.

I'm learning myself how to have fun acting. knowing what I know, paradoxically, I can see that it's the only possible way to "escape". all of the other actors will always be a reflection of your concepts of yourself (within the context of their role, of course)
