# dreamlog

a lot of dreams inspire me to write, so I decided I would make a formal log of them.

### 2022-06-28 12:12 - venus and adonis dream

it's hard to quantify this dream because it didn't really have much visuals to it. it did have a lot of conceptual and emotional data though which is what I will relate here.

first, it has resonance with [venus and adonis stuff I started to write about](/shakespere/venus-and-adonis.md) the other day, and in it patricia took the place of venus. I had always thought of her as venus for some reason -- and in that setup, I thought her "boyfriend" she claimed to have was saturn (which I mistakenly identified as sanatau/ptah), which made me thoth... I sorta disagreed with that setup, believing myself to be more similar to vulcan.

there was one time that I gave her a tuenti shirt and I asked her if it was too small (because it was even a little small on me), and she either saw the picture in my imagination of how I saw her or something, but she responded, "I'm not *that* big!!" -- probably because the way that I saw her, she probably had bigger boobs than she thought she did. I could never really remember the way she looked and I frequently thought she was more pretty than she thought she was.

so, inotherwords, appearing to me the way I wanted her to appear, gave her the qualities of genxicat, more than unessa. as I mentioned in [the venus and adonis thing](/shakespere/venus-and-adonis.md#a-bit-on-venus) and @[blahblog](2022-06-06 15:48), venus is a very dynamic character, because she's been associated with genxicat (ereshigal) in the form of desire, with sekhmet in the form of destruction and then described by then sirians as very organised...

    The affairs of the THIRD RAY department worked like 
    silk with her interjection of energy. Her personality was calm and 
    peaceful and she radiated security. She arrived on earth in a vehicle 
    like Ra's, consequently she too glowed. Unessa was exquisite of form 
    and grace as you would expect a THIRD RAY to be. She personified 
    divine intellect smoothly working amongst form.

notice how they directly mention she facilitates third ray energy ... nosebook is very 3rd ray. I don't know if she's very calm now and radiates security (she could be), but when I knew her, she had a lot of logic and objectives and knew the way toward what she wanted (very 3rd ray), and also got very upset when things didn't go her way, too (also very 3rd ray -- because all 3rd rays have "the right way").

anyway, in the dream, I noticed that there was a striking similarity between patricia and the venus described in shakespere's poem, because in that one venus holds a low opinion of herself. she doesn't find herself to be very beautiful, thinking that adonis is the beautiful one. that's the first aspect.

---

the second aspect is that there was a sense that I'm basically setting up the "bad guys" with all of the stuff that they need (ie nosebook) to essentially hold all humans out of their connecion for a very long time (1000y-bloom).

there was a bit of a realisation that I'm the "bad guys", but we're split between a lot of different bodies, and not all of us think the same. the other "bad guys" out there are like me in that they have to go about doing things their own way. they have to figure it out for theirselves, and nothing anyone says or does will change their mind; we're pretty thickheaded.

I don't really mind that they want to go about doing things their own way, and I think they'll eventually figure it out. from my perspective, I know that it's all attraction, so there's no way for anyone to have anything happen to them that they didn't attract.

I'm in the process of becoming 100% responsible for everything that's happening in my reality, and that process involves making a lot of changes to how I see everything happening to me. I imagine that a similar thing is happening all around the world, actually. for me, that's really awesome.

---

so then, the final aspect of the dream is going to be difficult to describe because it's so abstract meaning that it changed a number of times in the realisation of it, so I'm going to try and describe it in a few ways, but it's none of these ways exactly, as there still isn't a concrete enough way to render the idea into thought because its so abstract.

I mentioned a while back that I was interested in waiting for one of the girls to find their connection, and when one of them finds their connection, it'll be impossible for me to continue to stay away from my connection. that's one part of it. I also talked about a catalyst in @[random-thoughts](2022-06-27 21:18). that's another part of it.

now, the implications of this here are interesting because imagine how different things would have been if I had've got my connection back in spain. I was a complete mess back then and I was still attracting quite poorly, so it would have been a complete disaster.

I'm a lot better at attracting what I want now, so if I get my connection now, it'll be a lot less disastrous, but still pretty bad. it's for this reason that I'm prefectly fine waiting until I'm actually "perfected" in the sense of having perfect control over my reality because I'm attracting 100% of it. along that process, nosebook will slowly lose control over how much they can affect and control my reality, because my attraction will always be much more powerful than anything they can try to assert.

slowly I'll gain that 100% control that I'm looking for, and there won't be anything they can do about it. I'll continue to hold off on trying to gain my connection probably forever. like I said, I can self-sabotage indefinitely, and along the way the "bad guys" (that's us) will continue to gain more and more power.

eventually, like I said, one of the girls will find her connection, and I don't know what sort of stage of control over her attraction she'll be at, but I imagine she'll be closer to where I was in spain than to where I am now.

this, like the comet will be a sort of catalyst which sets something off a sort of disaster (but not in the physical sense), because I (and a lot of others) will suddenly gain our connection and attraction will become very rapid. I postulated a little about this with my work on [my sonnet thoughts](/shakespere/my-sonnet-thoughts.md) where I go though and describe the first 17 sonnets (the pyramid "socket") as being sorta written directly to me.

to me, it clearly describes a situation where I refuse to indulge in earthly pleasures, and what it sounds like happens to me is I skip completely over astral perception and go all the way to 5d, probably making it something that nosebook does not want me to be doing because I'd have to interact with the astral to be able to interact with physical humans. I'd have that genxicat quality where people see me the way as the object of their desire (imagination/astral), just like I first experienced with patricia a long time ago.

---

that's one way to look at it. another is that I'm basically setting the girls up for a massive failure because it's unlikely that many of them will actually be attracting what they want, so a lot of them will attract a manifestation of how they feel.

I noticed a lot of feeling like all of the "good guys" are "rare" -- and that, as I've mentioned before, this usually comes from not-good-enoughness (again, something that I first experienced with patricia), and I also felt a lot of in the venus and adonis poem as well (even though, it seems that adonis pays the price for venus' not-good-enoughness -- but it was likely his fault because he believed her silliness -- haven't read the whole thing yet).

that sort of attraction will continue to manifest reality that proves their own not-good-enoughness to them as more and more valid. to further this idea, I noticed a lot of resistance in the aspect of age. imagine that what I'm saying is correct and we *have* figured out a way to continue to delay this all the way until 2038 -- well, by then I'm going to be 54-55 and patricia 52-53 -- and I could feel how that really had a strong feeling of not-good-enoughness because of the emphasis on the physical being subject to age rather than a reflection of how one feels.

though I imagined that I would be close to patricia, my desire is to continue to on the journey of perfection, and so I would just sort of encourage her and stuff as I could feel when she's attracting out of "need" or "want" rather than "I AM" -- so I in that dream, I would continue to hold off because I'm sensitive enough to know that I don't like the way the attraction feels -- meanwhile, all of the "bad guys" are generations ahead of the humans in terms of their technology. there's no way we could possibly ever catch up.

this is a case of the tortoise and the hare, and I see it happen all of the time in software development. when the fuente of new ideas drys up, what ends up happening is they just go into maintenance and stabilisation mode. nodejs, is the most visible version of this. when node came out, it was revolutionary in a lot of its ideas, but that's where it stopped. it had to become enterprise stable to be a viable platform, so there wasn't really anything novel coming out of that. a new project will have to eventually supplant that one for something novel to show up. the bigger it gets, the more difficulty it is for a new project to supplant the previous. windows is another good example. it's not like somebody can just "easily" write another OS to supplant windows.

nosebook, like windows is going to be the monopoly for a very long time -- and even with how far ahead they are, it'll seem like they're impossible to catch up to, but every time, the tortoise (innovation) always catches up to the hare (monopoly), and that's just the way it goes for some reason. I think it has something to do with the concept of "stabilization theory" operating on the "species" of technology in terms of innovation as well.

---

finally, I want to leave the idea here that if we look at females in terms of the tortoise and the hare setup, girls mature a lot more rapidly than boys do. I, for example, did not actually begin to start to become conscious until I was in my 30s. prior to that, I was purely reaction and though I had ideas of what I wanted, if I was unable to control the conditions, I couldn't get what I wanted. this slow maturation cycle was greatly to my advantage because it gave me a lot of time to start to see that there's a lot more to reality than just the physical. if I had've matured really rapidly, I would still be like I was back then when I thought everything had a physical or material explanation to it.

in this way I was greatly advantaged to have had such a lengthy maturation. I'd say I really started to "get it" when I turned 32 then from there until about 36 is when I really started to finally "get it". when I turned 38 though, everything started to become easy. as I mentioned before 36 for women is when they are now definitely "old" -- and for men, this happens usually when they're 72 -- but like I said in comment to randall, this would correspond to the time when things started to become easy for me because my emotional/conceptual faculties started to open up. I think girls, like me are on the 36y cycle, so it's unfortunate that they believe theirselves to be "old", because that's when things should start to become easy as they transition out of physical perception into more emotional/conceptual perception (you can do anything you feel capable of doing).

I really think some of the girls will figure this out, and I really hope it is patricia. that would be *reallllllyyyy cool*!!! :)

### 2022-07-01 11:38 - dream about the three little girls

last night around 22:00 I was really tired after listening to snake-bros #111 and #112 so I laid down. I fell asleep and had a dream where I do remember it being somewhat visual -- though it wasn't at all like reality -- everything was really dark and I could barely see (like no lights at all -- just an ambiennt glow or something).

I don't remember the first part of the dream, but there was a lot of disorienting movement. I then looked up and saw this little white girl next to what looked like a giant picture frame hanging on the wall. I looked at her and felt strong attraction. I didn't know what to do, and then another white girl was over to the right. she was sitting and her eyes glowed a really bright pink colour when I looked at her. I again felt pretty uncomfortable because I felt attraction again. more disorienting movement and I noticed a black guy remark, "she's sitting right next to him and he's totally ignoring her" -- so I looked over and there was another girl sitting next to me to my left. I didn't get any information what colour her skin was. I laid on the ground (cause I think she was laying on the ground too) and tried to look at her but the dream abruptly ended.

---

I looked into what all of the symbols meant in context, and the sense that I got was that somebody is displeased with the recent events where I've been taking things a new direction with metal-lucifer and stuff like that. it felt like they were trying to push me back in the direction of little girls they can influence easily.

I noticed that it was also connected to this other thing: yesterday when I was taking a shower, one of the guys that scottie baldwin does mixes for popped into my head (wang leehom). his band did the outro music remix at the end of #111, ("shang yen serpent"?), and I was just listening to the way that they play the same song. it was completely different because they made breaks in the sound where I would have expected to have it more filled out. it didn't sound bad at all, and so I was trying to get into the mindset that produces that kind of sound (every musician tones the music in a way that resonates with their own vibration). it was an emotion that I had never experienced before and it was either "good" or "bad" so I thought I might compare it's feeling to kyle's -- because I know how kyle feels pretty well now. very interesting.

anyway, in the shower when thinking about that and it felt like there was desire to interact with me or perhaps that I was being summoned or something. difficult to describe. anyway, that part feels like it has connection to another set of dreams I had this morning... in those dreams, I was in a sort of party setting. I don't think I was drunk and I don't remember drinking either. I think I was just around a lot of other people that were partying -- though strange things were happening, and it felt intentional (either by the party people or the controllers of the dream -- not sure) but I lost or someone took my shoes and other strange events where I was constantly being pulled in a lot of different directions.

the part about being pulled in a lot of different directions felt like the theree girls in the previous dream where I wasn't looking or paying attention to the things they wanted or something so there was a new girl popping in to distract me from whatever the previos thing was. the party scene felt that way. the other thing is that it felt like the whole dream was to dissuade me from getting involved in activities for older people.

I think in general, nosebook is having a difficult time trying to keep a ton of young girls entertained and content that they remain engaged in -- so they probably want me to fill in that sort of niche or something. I don't know, but it felt like the dream was again another "bad idea" that they didn't want me to do -- or something like that.

I didn't seem to be all that bothered that the party was completely out of control. it started to get really difficult for me to follow but at the end there was some sort of gay and lesbians concert or sometihng that I wasn't sure at all what was going on. one nice thing about the party situation though is that I didn't feel like I was constantly being pushed to be sexually involved with someone. I was just another weird person along with them. that at least was cool.

---

OK, so then lemme go back a bit to last night after I woke up from the dream with the three girls and I was offering my opinion on the dream in a monologue, and in it I was saying that though they want to push me in the direction of little girls, I just don't see it happening.

I want to wait until I'm connected until I start to engage in any sexual activity, and so if I'm supposed to be going with some little girls, then once I'm connected I'll have to wait for her to figure out what she wants the whole time (or maybe nosebook has them well controlled, so they can actually influence her toward what "she" wants) -- I just don't know and the whole situation feels really weird to me. all the while, I'm sure there will be older girls that have been ready to go for quite a while and so it'll just be another waiting game.

in the opposite way of looking at it, let's just assume the other possibility is going to happen, which is that one of the girls finds her alignment and in doing so, she'll influence me into my alignment too (being around other high-energy people is a crazy experience for me). I just don't at all believe that any little girl could ever really accomplish that. you have to live some life to recognise that what I've figured out is actually worth something -- so to some extent any girl that would find her alignment *has* to have had enough unwanted to have happened to be able to appreciate the wanted. it's just not interesting.

when I was younger, I wasn't at all interested in trying to feel good, because I already felt good. even "bad" ideas felt good to me, because I was still in discovery mode learning new things and figuring out what doesn't feel good. maybe for girls it's different, but at least in my case, I *need* to have bad-feeling things happen to me and to grow out of them for me to actually appreciate the opposite. what I think our society has a problem with is saying to someone who's made a bad choice, that they're forever condemned and can never recover from such an awful event. I believe the contrary, and is that anyone who wants to recover from something, can -- and they should because that's the full extent of the waveform.

going from unwanted to wanted and back to unwanted again is what I'm all about (AC current). this idea of doing the girls thing is akin to trying to live life as DC.

the only time I have ever suggested that I wanted to do anything like DC is in the leapfrogging-time-pickles concept where I explained that once I've made it through the timeline and I can't go any further (cause there's no way anymore to keep me from my connection), from that point in the future (say 1000y from now or whatever) I put myself back into a body and then I setup the most difficult setup I can possibly give myself. I know I'll make it through because it's all attraction, so from there I keep piling on the difficulty (cause that makes the most speed) until I'm finally connected, then from there good conditions all of the way (cause bad conditions aren't keeping me away from my connection). I gain as much speed as I can, knowing that at the end of the timeline I have to get back to where I was (cause it's all attraction) -- so even if I was at quite an altitude, from the new altitude, it's quite a drop -- so even then it's not really DC because I'm guaranteed to crash and burn from the highest possibly hights ever accomplished. as usual, I/we'll be reborn into something entirely new.

so even if the goal of all of the good conditions is to crash and burn really hard, why would I slow myself down by going too soon with a manifestation? it doesn't make sense! like I've said previously, I want to try and extend this out for as long as I possibly can to ensure as much speed as possible. more speed = more crash and burn at the end (obviously).

so, maybe it is a good thing to delay the whole thing by involving myself in more subjects that little girls may not appreciate. I'm sure that nosebook will be able to figure out how to keep the little girls busy. they'll want to figure out how to not rely on me, because when I'm finally ready to go, only those with astral vision will be able to see me. 

### 2022-07-04 11:55 - starting over dream

I woke up this morning with a dream where I don't remember much of it, but I was definitely working with kyle and russ. there was something about allen (their last name) and another thing that I remember is that we were refiguring out color space and stuff. the sense that I had in the dream and once awoken is that we had kinda decided to start over entirely.

the idea is, instead of waiting until a catalcysm forces us to start over, why not throw out the entire "standard model" and start over now; just assume that we know nothing and rediscover everything.

I liked the idea, but it didn't really feel all that good to me, especially once I started to write about it here. so I'll give some background.

---

yesterday I did a bit of a different day in that I listened to conspirinormal with seriah about seth, and a where did the road go episode with tamra lucid and her stories about manly p. hall. finally, another where did the road go show about 5d, magick and death. anyway, between the shows there was a resonance about how manly "freestyles" these lengthy presentations without notes, or how manly told ronnie to only talk about something once he knew it so well he didn't need to use notes.

I'm kinda that way about the world of ideas (the conceptual world). I don't have direct 5d perception at the moment, but I do feel comfortable with my understanding of the world that I'm willing to talk about it without any hesitations.

later on when I wrote down my ideas about @[blahblog](2022-07-03 12:22), I used the example of not feeling like I need to preserve things because I've found that the fundamental concept of how these things work is sorta like part of my personality, and so my ability to tune into that technology is limited by how I conceptualise my reality.

OK, an example of this may be for example, that if I feel that everything is under constant decay, I'll see that all systems are closed systems, and that there's no input and output from another -- unseen -- world. or, for example if I feel I need to keep everything compartmentalised, I'll likely look at all of the parts, but never see the whole. or, if I believe that all consciousness is calculating and trying always to get a power position over its adversaries (the idea behind the "fallen-angels" idea) -- then, I would perceive all interactions in nature as being one of assertion (explosions, impacts, etc) and not of mutual-back-scratching. or, if I see everything as mutual-back-scratching, I may not believe that everything has a resonance structure to it and is therefore *attracting* the things around it that it needs to sustain itself.

in my world the conceptualisation process of the human determines the way that the science is discovered. I believe it was also in #113 or #114 that russ's "snake thoughts" was wondering what mind control is all about -- and then they came to the idea of what if you told something that a steel ball is alien tech and so by getting people to believe that, they discovered new things about the steel ball that they didn't previously know about -- and it was in the framework that the steel ball is alien tech instead of just a steel ball that we all know how a steel ball works (duh), that we discovered new things about the steel ball by believing it's alien tech.

that's kinda what I'm talking about... it's been shown[^1] that our assumptions and expectations of something limit the manifestation of it, and so by opening up the "standard model" and assuming we know nothing allows new facets of the manifestation to appear which were previously held out of manifestation because of our assumptions[^2].

color may be like this as well. I experience color a little bit differently than most, so I may be predisposed to finding new ideas. for example, I heard from joseph brown (I think) that different colors manifest in different directions -- so when the wave is coming toward you it shows green and purple but going away shows red and something else. I can't remember how it went now, but the idea is we may have some of the most basic concepts about the continuous (blackbody) spectrum that our sun emits.

---

almost certainly there will be resistance to the idea, but I do think it's kind of a neat idea to perhaps just assume we know nothing and start over completely. we don't need to use sticks and stones to perform our measurements, just like when I want to rewrite my code, I don't have to reinvint the operating system, a text editor, and compiler before I begin.

I do think it's a worthwhile effort, and I do think that it should all be done in the open and stuff so that all experiments can be repeated.

it's pretty clear that it'll eventually succomb to the same thing that science has now, and we'll need to start over again in the future, because you can imagine that if a person's concept of reality influences the result of the experiment, if someone else repeats the experiment and gets a different result, and everything is open and documented, it'll only illustrate the difference in conceptualisation of reality between the previous experimenter and the future one. it's even possible that it could go the opposite way and some experimenters won't want to have their name pinned to the discovery, for it'll illustrate their conceptualisation of reality. statistically speaking, for groups of experimenters, it'll be pretty easy to tease out who is the most allowing of new discoveries and who is the most presumptuous.

all every interesting ideas. cool dream.

[1]: not sure how much of it, but I think this is what sigils in chaos magic is about, and I've talked extensively on the idea of how your (symbolic, not verbal) "expectation" of an idea limits its manifestation -- so in terms of random, it begins to appear like you're "controlling" the random by expecting a thing out of it, but in reality this is just a limitation of manifestation potential. it's sorta like using doubt to "predict" something, and so then you're using something that was previously counterproductive to your advantage.

[2]: an example of this might be that we don't *actually* know what copper is really capable of, so it's quite possible that we don't really understand the copper chisels and weapons because we're looking at copper with the standard model of assumptions and expectations, when the ancients may have had an entirely different conception of copper, and so therefore, for them it behaved differently.

### 2022-07-04 18:06 - the ancient serpent and an old dream I had

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_x03O1-MHI)

huh, interesting ... I just noticed that the timestamp is the same day that they recorded the show: 06:06 (PM). I'm also reminded of an old (apocalyptic) dream that I had probably around 2004-5 or so (I've mentioned it before). I was drowning in the ocean and I saw that the united states was falling apart. I could see an a fighter jet painting the words "SOS" in the sky. I took this to be a signal that bad things were going to happen. my father rescued me from the water, and I was laying on the sand looking at the "SOS" in the sky, and when I opened my eyes, it was my red LED alarm clock flashing "6:06" (I guess the power had gone out). it was weird.

---

anyway, I wanted to talk about the second half of that episode because he starts to talk about the garden of eden and the serpent in the OT. in the NT he is the last book of the bible, rev 12 where the ancient serpent that *deceived* mankind is once again deceiving and this *deception* is what causes the michael and his angels to cast fire and rocks toward the earth (censer imagery and everything)...

OK, so kyle brought up that the serpent is a symbol for knowledge, and randall brought up that YHVH didn't want their *eyes to be opened*, and so it was their opening of the eyes that was the problem.

OK, so just track with me. in various places around the bible, the serpent is the kundalini rising ... it's the spiraling/rotating energy that rises up the spine and then the whole head gets filled with light. this is when crazy attraction starts to happen very rapidly. that explains the knowledge and the eyes being opened part.

now, once the kundalini has risen, then you become very attractive and reality happens very fast, and so you could imagine that if a whole bunch of people were to have their kundalini to rise up, it would spell disaster really quickly. inotherwords, when the ancient serpent (kundalini) begins to rise again, this is what attracts these projectiles that pierce the earth's atmosphere (comets, etc.).

so the serpent of old is not really any exterior character in particular, but actually a condition. to explain this, randall delves into the word, "deceive" -- and that is to wander, to stray away from, or to go the unorthodox way.

orthodoxy is the "mainstream" or "standard model" of perception, and when people had their kundalini rising up, everyone had their own way of perceiving reality become real to each of them personally. this creates conflict and it's that conflict that causes dissatisfaction.

sure, if everyone were on the same page and believing the same thing, then supposedly all would go well... I disagree.

---

OK, earlier today I had a discussion with jeri about DMT, serotonin, and melatonin. I was explaining to her that serotonin is mostly produced in the gut in response to your emotion (that's what gut feelings are). that serotonin gets then synthesised (I believe) in the pineal gland into DMT and melotonin. so, when you don't feel very good, your body will turn that serotonin into melotonin which will cause you to sleep. the serotonin now converted into melotonin still contains the vibration of the emotion and so when you sleep you stop thinking for a while, so your vibration wanes and you become less resistant. then upon coming back into consciousness, you begin to dream and those dreams are created from the vibration of your previous emotions (serotonin->melotonin), so the symbols, images, and feelings that you experience in the dream come about as the vibrational difference between your now less-resistant state (from sleeping) and the vibration of your melotonin.

the result is the perception of that emotion from a much less resistant state, and so the emotion is perceived very symbolically. obviously those symbols create a new emotion and that's the emotion that you start your day with.

---

OK, so you can probably see that process as happening pretty well in the waking phase of life, but imagine for a moment that your kundalini has risen and your pineal is producing DMT instead of melatonin. well, those symbols are going to start taking shape just like they are in your dream state, but without having lowered resistance -- sorta like a nightmare -- which is just not having released resistance (ie holding on to an emotionally troubling thing) so those symbols trigger some deep emotions in you and they turn into bigger problems.

basically, when the serpent "deceived" everyone, our kundalini's rose, some people experienced amazing things and others a complete nightmare. the catastrophe is the result of the nightmare.

personally, I believe that when that happens, there is an automatic split that happens, because if I'm living a really nice reality and someone else is living a nightmare, they're incompatible, so I wouldn't really worry too much about all of that if you're good at attracting what you want.

---

so now I want to remind you of the deceiver part -- the staying from the orthodox perception of reality. I've contended in various places that the whole goal of nosebook is to ensure that the unauthorised people don't get their kundalini to rise. I'd have to check with randall on this, but it's very likely that the secret societies that teach this stuff have strict guidelines on how to operate (IMO, very limiting) to prevent doing too much damage to yourself and to others. this is probably ensured through a merit system and so only once you've proven your ability not to cause serious problems, then you can have it. whatever it is, it's the "you gatta earn it" vibe. what I'm trying to say here is that their system is setup and designed not to cause a lot of problems -- so they're the "orthodox", and we're the hotshots that are going to start going a different way from the orthodox and attracting a cataclysm[^1].

what my dream this morning was about was the idea of going the wayward (unorthodox) way *without* the kundalini (serpent of old) opening our eyes and "deceiving" us.

---

there are a number of implications to this idea, and the major one that I contend is that we're all going to go for a very long time without our "eyes being opened". personally, I don't really find this to be a problem as I'm totally cool without having all of the visuals. if I never get the "eyes opening" bit, that's totally fine with me. it just means my attraction speed is going to be a lot slower than it would otherwise be. however, given the current acceleration of my attraction, this seems perfectly fine to me.

the other major problem with this is the space problem. what I mean is, "they" (the people running the show) don't want us getting out into space because once we go to mars, then we have all of this stuff there and what if there is archeology that's done there, etc. it's a big problem for them, and they'll likely have to get rid of a lot of the stuff that's present on mars that they may be trying to get rid of[^2]. this doesn't have to be solved now because

[1]: yes, of course this is a very generalised view, and I can feel the reactions wondering why these secret societies often cause problems on earth (starting wars, etc. ref: bramley, gods of eden) -- but just for the sake of argument, let's assume that all of them are the same and they're all following the laws which minimise risk of catastrophe -- unlikely to be true, but just go with it.

[2]: who knows what they're doing up there, and I've noticed that the planet is much less red, meaning that their planet probably isn't running the pyramids at full speed anymore, so the red (iron oxide) is going out of the atmosphere. iron is the final stage in the fusion process, and I believe this is why OAHSPE calls earth the "red star" because we had a very red atmosphere because of the high fusion happening in the atmosphere.
