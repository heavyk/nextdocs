# dreamlog

a lot of dreams inspire me to write, so I decided I would make a formal log of them.

### 2022-06-28 12:12 - venus and adonis dream

it's hard to quantify this dream because it didn't really have much visuals to it. it did have a lot of conceptual and emotional data though which is what I will relate here.

first, it has resonance with [venus and adonis stuff I started to write about](/shakespere/venus-and-adonis.md) the other day, and in it patricia took the place of venus. I had always thought of her as venus for some reason -- and in that setup, I thought her "boyfriend" she claimed to have was saturn (which I mistakenly identified as sanatau/ptah), which made me thoth... I sorta disagreed with that setup, believing myself to be more similar to vulcan.

there was one time that I gave her a tuenti shirt and I asked her if it was too small (because it was even a little small on me), and she either saw the picture in my imagination of how I saw her or something, but she responded, "I'm not *that* big!!" -- probably because the way that I saw her, she probably had bigger boobs than she thought she did. I could never really remember the way she looked and I frequently thought she was more pretty than she thought she was.

so, inotherwords, appearing to me the way I wanted her to appear, gave her the qualities of genxicat, more than unessa. as I mentioned in [the venus and adonis thing](/shakespere/venus-and-adonis.md#a-bit-on-venus) and @[blahblog](2022-06-06 15:48), venus is a very dynamic character, because she's been associated with genxicat (ereshigal) in the form of desire, with sekhmet in the form of destruction and then described by then sirians as very organised...

    The affairs of the THIRD RAY department worked like 
    silk with her interjection of energy. Her personality was calm and 
    peaceful and she radiated security. She arrived on earth in a vehicle 
    like Ra's, consequently she too glowed. Unessa was exquisite of form 
    and grace as you would expect a THIRD RAY to be. She personified 
    divine intellect smoothly working amongst form.

notice how they directly mention she facilitates third ray energy ... nosebook is very 3rd ray. I don't know if she's very calm now and radiates security (she could be), but when I knew her, she had a lot of logic and objectives and knew the way toward what she wanted (very 3rd ray), and also got very upset when things didn't go her way, too (also very 3rd ray -- because all 3rd rays have "the right way").

anyway, in the dream, I noticed that there was a striking similarity between patricia and the venus described in shakespere's poem, because in that one venus holds a low opinion of herself. she doesn't find herself to be very beautiful, thinking that adonis is the beautiful one. that's the first aspect.

---

the second aspect is that there was a sense that I'm basically setting up the "bad guys" with all of the stuff that they need (ie nosebook) to essentially hold all humans out of their connecion for a very long time (1000y-bloom).

there was a bit of a realisation that I'm the "bad guys", but we're split between a lot of different bodies, and not all of us think the same. the other "bad guys" out there are like me in that they have to go about doing things their own way. they have to figure it out for theirselves, and nothing anyone says or does will change their mind; we're pretty thickheaded.

I don't really mind that they want to go about doing things their own way, and I think they'll eventually figure it out. from my perspective, I know that it's all attraction, so there's no way for anyone to have anything happen to them that they didn't attract.

I'm in the process of becoming 100% responsible for everything that's happening in my reality, and that process involves making a lot of changes to how I see everything happening to me. I imagine that a similar thing is happening all around the world, actually. for me, that's really awesome.

---

so then, the final aspect of the dream is going to be difficult to describe because it's so abstract meaning that it changed a number of times in the realisation of it, so I'm going to try and describe it in a few ways, but it's none of these ways exactly, as there still isn't a concrete enough way to render the idea into thought because its so abstract.

I mentioned a while back that I was interested in waiting for one of the girls to find their connection, and when one of them finds their connection, it'll be impossible for me to continue to stay away from my connection. that's one part of it. I also talked about a catalyst in @[random-thoughts](2022-06-27 21:18). that's another part of it.

now, the implications of this here are interesting because imagine how different things would have been if I had've got my connection back in spain. I was a complete mess back then and I was still attracting quite poorly, so it would have been a complete disaster.

I'm a lot better at attracting what I want now, so if I get my connection now, it'll be a lot less disastrous, but still pretty bad. it's for this reason that I'm prefectly fine waiting until I'm actually "perfected" in the sense of having perfect control over my reality because I'm attracting 100% of it. along that process, nosebook will slowly lose control over how much they can affect and control my reality, because my attraction will always be much more powerful than anything they can try to assert.

slowly I'll gain that 100% control that I'm looking for, and there won't be anything they can do about it. I'll continue to hold off on trying to gain my connection probably forever. like I said, I can self-sabotage indefinitely, and along the way the "bad guys" (that's us) will continue to gain more and more power.

eventually, like I said, one of the girls will find her connection, and I don't know what sort of stage of control over her attraction she'll be at, but I imagine she'll be closer to where I was in spain than to where I am now.

this, like the comet will be a sort of catalyst which sets something off a sort of disaster (but not in the physical sense), because I (and a lot of others) will suddenly gain our connection and attraction will become very rapid. I postulated a little about this with my work on [my sonnet thoughts](/shakespere/my-sonnet-thoughts.md) where I go though and describe the first 17 sonnets (the pyramid "socket") as being sorta written directly to me.

to me, it clearly describes a situation where I refuse to indulge in earthly pleasures, and what it sounds like happens to me is I skip completely over astral perception and go all the way to 5d, probably making it something that nosebook does not want me to be doing because I'd have to interact with the astral to be able to interact with physical humans. I'd have that genxicat quality where people see me the way as the object of their desire (imagination/astral), just like I first experienced with patricia a long time ago.

---

that's one way to look at it. another is that I'm basically setting the girls up for a massive failure because it's unlikely that many of them will actually be attracting what they want, so a lot of them will attract a manifestation of how they feel.

I noticed a lot of feeling like all of the "good guys" are "rare" -- and that, as I've mentioned before, this usually comes from not-good-enoughness (again, something that I first experienced with patricia), and I also felt a lot of in the venus and adonis poem as well (even though, it seems that adonis pays the price for venus' not-good-enoughness -- but it was likely his fault because he believed her silliness -- haven't read the whole thing yet).

that sort of attraction will continue to manifest reality that proves their own not-good-enoughness to them as more and more valid. to further this idea, I noticed a lot of resistance in the aspect of age. imagine that what I'm saying is correct and we *have* figured out a way to continue to delay this all the way until 2038 -- well, by then I'm going to be 54-55 and patricia 52-53 -- and I could feel how that really had a strong feeling of not-good-enoughness because of the emphasis on the physical being subject to age rather than a reflection of how one feels.

though I imagined that I would be close to patricia, my desire is to continue to on the journey of perfection, and so I would just sort of encourage her and stuff as I could feel when she's attracting out of "need" or "want" rather than "I AM" -- so I in that dream, I would continue to hold off because I'm sensitive enough to know that I don't like the way the attraction feels -- meanwhile, all of the "bad guys" are generations ahead of the humans in terms of their technology. there's no way we could possibly ever catch up.

this is a case of the tortoise and the hare, and I see it happen all of the time in software development. when the fuente of new ideas drys up, what ends up happening is they just go into maintenance and stabilisation mode. nodejs, is the most visible version of this. when node came out, it was revolutionary in a lot of its ideas, but that's where it stopped. it had to become enterprise stable to be a viable platform, so there wasn't really anything novel coming out of that. a new project will have to eventually supplant that one for something novel to show up. the bigger it gets, the more difficulty it is for a new project to supplant the previous. windows is another good example. it's not like somebody can just "easily" write another OS to supplant windows.

nosebook, like windows is going to be the monopoly for a very long time -- and even with how far ahead they are, it'll seem like they're impossible to catch up to, but every time, the tortoise (innovation) always catches up to the hare (monopoly), and that's just the way it goes for some reason. I think it has something to do with the concept of "stabilization theory" operating on the "species" of technology in terms of innovation as well.

---

finally, I want to leave the idea here that if we look at females in terms of the tortoise and the hare setup, girls mature a lot more rapidly than boys do. I, for example, did not actually begin to start to become conscious until I was in my 30s. prior to that, I was purely reaction and though I had ideas of what I wanted, if I was unable to control the conditions, I couldn't get what I wanted. this slow maturation cycle was greatly to my advantage because it gave me a lot of time to start to see that there's a lot more to reality than just the physical. if I had've matured really rapidly, I would still be like I was back then when I thought everything had a physical or material explanation to it.

in this way I was greatly advantaged to have had such a lengthy maturation. I'd say I really started to "get it" when I turned 32 then from there until about 36 is when I really started to finally "get it". when I turned 38 though, everything started to become easy. as I mentioned before 36 for women is when they are now definitely "old" -- and for men, this happens usually when they're 72 -- but like I said in comment to randall, this would correspond to the time when things started to become easy for me because my emotional/conceptual faculties started to open up. I think girls, like me are on the 36y cycle, so it's unfortunate that they believe theirselves to be "old", because that's when things should start to become easy as they transition out of physical perception into more emotional/conceptual perception (you can do anything you feel capable of doing).

I really think some of the girls will figure this out, and I really hope it is patricia. that would be *reallllllyyyy cool*!!! :)
