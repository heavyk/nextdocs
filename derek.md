hi,
somewhere a while back you said to send a video of novel ways to look at the universe. I lolligagged (is that even a word?) for a while on it because I didn't really want to spend the time to make a video. it's honestly the easiest thing for me to try and think of a video -- as in write out the concept, but the idea of trying to communicate that to an audience is a different thing entirely. I speak plainly, but there are imaginably implications that challenge our conception of consciousness and what it means to be human.

so, since I write best, here we go...

---

I think of magnetism like a field of really tiny particles that are rotating in in macro movement -- sorta like how a fan turns the air in front of it pushing these little air, or in this case, ether particles around. therefore, when thme fans are facing in the same diretction, they attract each other (imagine them being in a weightless environment with wireless power for the motors) spinning, or from our perspective, vibrating.

so now, we can look to the cosmos and see that the stars are all oriented in a certain direction, that will tell us about this galaxy's magnetism.

if we think of these rotating things like solar systems, it makes the example easier. when all of the spinners (not to be confused with a spinnor) are facing the same thing, we call this a permanent magnet. when they're all oriented in diffrent random directions, those different orientations produce a waveform (like light, think of how it has polarisation), meaning that if you pick one polarisation, then all of the solar systems are all facing in one direction or the other (left spin or right spin). this means that they're a frequency.

---

next, I'd like to talk about gravity which is the opposite side of the same thing. every particle has sub particles and so therefore a lot more higher frequency frequencies. I've heard that the subatomic frequency is quite active compared to the superatomic. I'd like to think of atoms now as solar systems meaning they have different things spinning on the inside together (I know that some solar systems don't have a star in the middle, ours being one of them), however the important thing to note is that they have a vibration to them. our solar system is quite slow and large because it gained a lot of matter (things that we believe are real). I simplify that super complex thing to mean that they have a lot spinning in common. you could imagine that a star like our own would be vibrationally attracted to other stars of similar vibrational composition.

lol, anyway, they are emitting a vibration, and that vibration is determined by their internal spinnors (things in relation to the most dominant -- which you can think of as a giant mass of really high frequency things that have been produced as harmonics of all of these vibrational interactions. I consider these to be from the solar system's perspective of the dominant one looking in, every object is in relation to th dominant and which now exhibit 720(degress) of rotational difference. again, not to be confused with the solar system itself a spinner when looking out from an attraction point of view.

I say attraction, because like the synchronising metronomes, all things that are of a similar enough vibration (meaning they share a medium), then begin to affect each other's vibrations. you attract everyone who is more than 50% similar to you in vibration, and would it not be for the repelling (gravity force) then all things would collide.

the frequency that you emit is the composition of all of the matter that's inside of you. all of the matter is your beliefs. you believe in this stuff. it's real. when you go outside you see it because it's reql. you are vibrationally sympathetic to it in some way. if it's here and it's not disappearing, then it's attracted. attraction and repulsion are the same force; only a measure of difference in harmony and dissonance.

one more try: the difference between the spinnor and the spinner is the perspective. inside of the solar system, everything is a spinnor (having 720(degrees) of difference), however when the solar system looks out, it's perceiving from the magnetic or attractive perspective, which is that things having a similar vibration (spinner), which, in physicality, often times have similar orientation and similarity of all of it's many multitudes of bits of matter orbiting inside of it.

we can look at ourselves a bit like these solar systems. we've got a lot of matter built up in the form of beliefs about our reality and the people around us. all of these bits of matter orbit a centre point of some sort and all of those internal spinnors are all attracting others with similar vibration. this helps us to understand gravity.

all things that vibrate similarly attract each other.

I've also done some inquiry into the sun and carbon (they both share a similar vibrational lattice, hexagonal planar) and that stuff is fascinating. hydrogen, I don't it is quite what we think it is. I'm having to redo my own concepts of it, even as we speak.

you know this is probably the 4th or 5th rendering of the idea and this time especially, I noticed a lot of things that were already outdated. you can render any concept you want into something physical if you want to. just write about it and let it flow. it's a cultivated skill that starts, for me at least, with writing down my emotions, then concepts, then emotions in relation to concepts, until I can just start to write about the concept.

it's looking at you all of the time (these are very high frequency things, but not quite subatomic). I call it the conceptual realm. it's probably somewhere past gamma or something physically speaking, but these concepts exist in a relatively stable self-perpetuating structures which can be interacted with frequentially. our mind is exceptionally well suited for it, but I had to be able to turn down the noise by understanding it. when I understood all the noise, meaning that nothing really bothers me anymore, then I always get a clear signal. I can tell by how I feel.

### 2022-11-13 10:44 - try again

I do not pretend to try and understand the universe until I can think like the universe. same with planets, stars, and galaxies.

I thought I would try rendering the concept again this time from high frequency down to physical, instead of the other way. it'll probably illuminate the idea a little better. each time that I render the concept, it comes out better, so eventually it'll be so easy to understnad that there won't be any more questions. I'm going to try and integrate a few things that noticed in the reactions as well. first though, I want to talk a little bit about my process.

I call this process "conceptual viewing" as it's quite similar to remote viewing, but for things that are not visible (like concepts, ideas, thoughts, and emotions). every person has the capability, and I'm even convinced that primates have it. we call "instinct" but in reality it's just a hyper sensitivity to the part of the vibrational spectrum that we think of as concept and emotion. we know what infrared and visible light is. my emperience tells me that UV stronly influences the astral or imaginary frequency span, and so I figure that the conceptual is almost certainly going to be in frequencies of x-ray range or higher.

anyway, the way that remote viewing is done, is you pick a target -- something to look at -- and then wait for sense impressions to begin to come to you. if you're good, you cal feel it and interact with the object as if it were real and right in front of you (this is what tesla did with his inventions). conceptual viewing is like that, cept there's nothing to see on the screen.

a good way to imagine this will be like an LCD screen. if you've ever had one of the backlights go out, you'll notice that the pixels are still changing colour (if you look really carefully), but because the backlight is out, the screen appears black. I'm looking at a black screen, but I can begin to "see" what is on the screen because I'm not looking at the visible portion of the spectrum. I'm looking at the conceptual instead. this is the range of frequencies that are somewhere between the wavelength of DNA and subatromic particles. it's quite small and fast, so you'll need to develop the capacity a bit.

developing this capacity isn't really hard. we aready do it and it's strongly linked to telepathy and emotion. to explain what I mean, let's go back to the LCD screen. imagine for a moment that I'm a newborn loking at the screen. I see only a chaos of colours because I don't have concepts for some of the shapes and colours yet. as I learn similar shapes (a square, circle, etc) I can start to begin to recognise those shapes. I can also remember that I've seen that colour before as well. those are conepts. they're non-physical things that can have any number of physical instantiations in many shapes and sizes.

religion calls these abstract ideals the "spirit", but I find that terminology to be counterproductive, so I use the word concept because it's more comprehensive and better represents the idea. you are a concept of yourself, and the body that you inhabit (with all of its physical attributes, good and bad) is a physical manifestation of that concept. it's quite a complex concept.

every time that you think, you produce a concept. to explain, imagine for a moment what happens when you take two waves and you iteract them. you'll get constructive/destructive interference, but also you'll get an infinite set of higher frequency harmonics as a result. you can imagine that there have been quite a few vibrational interactions over the last few billion years (or whatever it's supposed to be), and so you can imagine that there are lots and lots and lots of really high frequency harmonics out there somewhere in space. I consider space to be the repository of all free-floating (ie not yet attracted to other similar vibrations) vibrations. the big clumps of stuff like stars and planets all have some similar enough vibrational thing that is keeping them together.

to help me to think of it like that, I refer to the unorganised chaos as desire because it's the result of all vibrations had a part which wasn't harmonious. I think of the structure that holds all of these clumps together, "structure" because it's mostly perceptual. for example, I'm iron and you're iron so we want to stick together on the atomic scale, but two clumps of iron with a similar orientation of our atoms, that one clump is attracted to another clump on the macro scale "magnetically". if the atoms were facing each other (instead of the same direction), these clumps would repel (see previous email). because the clumps repel or attract on a macro scale, they want to come together, but because the interface does not have a truly flat surface (like johansen blocks), they'll never fuse at the atomic scale. still their "perception" or orientation here determines the "structure" and says what other particles can link/bind/fuse (not sure the right word) up to other atoms (carbon has three of these docking stations, btw, one at each corner of the cube).

oops derailed. when we think about things each thought is a vibrational interaction that produces a lot of high frequency harmonics. when people think, their thoughts (through these vibrational interactions), emit concepts. they can be felt and looked into further with this conceptual viewing (I actually recommend that somone cultivate the skill by conceptually viewing emotions felt from other people and trying to understand the perspective from which that concept was created from). therefore, we all have this capability, and it's most of what we call "non-verbal communication". because children don't have so many concepts when they start out (I actually believe) that our starting concepts and what is important/interesting to the child is actually passed heretically through the x-chromosome, but I digress.

imagine for a moment that there was some magical way to turn off our ability to receive and transmit concepts/emotion -- well, then I would see the LCD screen, and I would be back to being like a newborn, where I see things, but the high frequency conceptual data isn't recognisable to me yet, se I'm looking at physical pixels but I don't even see physical shapes or colours (with drugs, when this starts to set in, it's called the "ego death") because you lose focus of yourself as a concept and start to become a part of the other conceptual chaos, and no are you set apart and differentiated from the other vibrations.

that's good for now. I'll do another rendering again soon. when these ideas come into my head, they are a flash, but sometimes it takes pages to write them out.

sincerely,
kenny

### 2022-11-13 11:48 - ether, mediums and sonic booms

in the first email I talked about an ether. I know it supposedly doesn't exist and stuff like that, but I didn't have a good name for it. there are divisions of frequential spaces into "mediums" which behave something like a fluid or a gas. I prefer to think of them like water, where they have an imbalance of two very different element types (oxygen and hydrogen in the case of water), so if look at water no longer as a fluid but now as a whole lot of suspended particles (suspended because of their frequencial differences in the different units). a water molecule stays a water molucule for the same reason that legos stay together. the different parts that make up the whole all fit together at the points that the atoms come together to make the structure (the orientation and vibrational affinity to other atoms). structure exists at the molecular level, but it continues into smaller and smaller quantities. when science finally gets the ability to look subatomically, they will see that subatomically, there are countless of these vibrating structures. they appear to me to be related to consciousness. when I look at them, what I see is a whole bunch of points that are looking at each other, then it switches to another configuration where they look out differently. these dfferent configurations create geometric shapes and all sorts of interesting patterns (I have an interesting thing to say about this and penrose tiles, btw), and so when I look at water, I see the same thing. I see a bunch of bigger and smaller points (the OH atoms, I suppose) all moving around creating various shapes and things. not all water vibrates the same though -- you could say that some is more coherent than others, and so that one experiment that the japanese scientist did looking at emotion and water crystals makes perfect sense to me, because the crystals will form in relflection of these dancing water molecules structures.

I noticed that any time you have a set of dancing (the sequence isn't always binary) particles, you get a medium. again, water is the easiest one to see here. that medium has a rate in which a vibration on one end of the medium can propagate the vibration without losing its structure. you need a real vibrational lattice in order to emit a continuous spectrum, meaning that the surface of the sun has a vibrational structure to it, and that structure can produce all the frequencies in the "blackbody spectrum" (I strongly recommend you look into dr. robataille's work for more on that).

so, how do these extremely high freqency harmonics (desire) turn into something of structure? again, I'd like to refer to the newborn and the LCD screen. you'll notice that the newborn does not (at first) have a concept/pattern to recognise anything in all of the chaos. however, gradually, certain patterns start to become more recognisable. the recognised pattern is always a reflection of the structure and the concepts of the observer, meaning you'll always see what you're "programmed" (socially, culturally, or genetically) to see what you want to see. you *want* to make sense of this chaos, and so all children (not so much adults) have a voracity to understand new higher and higher frequency concepts (natural language is the next big one after your senses).

because concepts are vibrational patterns (harmonies, dissonances), the medium/structure is what allows for the propagation/transmission of these concepts. uhoh... I noticed that someone reading this is noticing that (something like) all things are conscious/living in some sort of way, and even the inanimate stuff like metals and electricity has a conceptual form to it. yes, the universe is mind, I think thoth once said. it's true. you cannot understand the universe until you *think* like the universe does. all things "think" in that their frequential interactions emit things that we understand as concepts/emotion. it also means everything is understandable, too.

I'll try to get to sonic booms next time (that is when something travels faster than the propagation speed of the medium). until next time,
kenny

### 2022-11-13 13:51 - the three docking ports

there are a lot of properties to a cube which are fascinating. have a look at this: take any three vertices of a cube, and you will create an equilateral triangle in the verticies. now, behind the three edges of the equilateral triangle there are actually two lines on the cube for each of these equilateral triagles. all 6 of these lines form a sorta vacuum cube. you can see (depending on the angle you look at it) that it's a cube with the back and front vertices removed. I call this shape the "moutains" or the "rhythm" of the shape (each shape has a different "rhythm" on its equator).

the docking ports can be any of those points of the equilateral triangle, and the equilateral triangle take take on quite a few (never counted, 12?) different arrangements. it seems to me that hydrogens like to connect to these points, and I think hydrogen is the most flexible in its frequecy that it can easily dock to that port. there's something important that happens when all these triangles are all arrranged in the same way. it looks like graphene. it's quite strong because everything is facing the same direction and fractures happen when the carbon has triangles that are at too acute (thin?) of an angle that the carbon can slip/shift into a new position.

I think of all magnets as a monopole. imagine this as the top part of a torroidal field (the mushroom bit that extends out like a barbell). let's say that iron spins CW, the N pole is coming *out* in a CW rotation -- well, that means then the S pole is coming now *in* CW also, and so when you have coming out CW next to coming in it experiences attraction. if it's coming out CW and it's next to a coming in CW, it experiences repulsion, much like two fans facing each other would repel each other, but a fan behind another fan will get pulled toward the first fan.

so then when iron is not magnetised all of the iron atoms are all facing random directions. however, when a large magnet influences all of those atoms to face the same direction, then iron becomes magnetised. that's ferro magnetism.

diamagntism is the exact opposite: imagine for a moment that iron spins CW and gold spins CCW -- when gold gets near to magnetised iron, then the spin is opposite, so experiences repulsion -- or diamagnetism.

finally, polarisation of light is just the orientation of the spin of the wave propagating through the medium. I would imagine that polarisers are essentially aligned magnets allowing only same direction rotating waves to pass through.
