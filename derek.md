hi,
somewhere a while back you said to send a video of novel ways to look at the universe. I lolligagged (is that even a word?) for a while on it because I didn't really want to spend the time to make a video. it's honestly the easiest thing for me to try and think of a video -- as in write out the concept, but the idea of trying to communicate that to an audience is a different thing entirely. I speak plainly, but there are imaginably implications that challenge our conception of consciousness and what it means to be human.

so, since I write best, here we go...

I think of magnetism like a field of really tiny particles that are rotating in in macro movement -- sorta like how a fan turns the air in front of it pushing these little air/ether particles around. therefore, when thme fans are facing in the same diretction, they attract each other (imagine them being in a weightless environment with wireless power) spinning, or from our perspective, vibrating.

so now, we can look to the cosmos and see that the stars are all oriented in a certain direction, that will tell us about this galaxy's magnetism.

if we think of these rotating things like solar systems, it makes the example easier. when all of the spinners (not to be confused with a spinnor) are facing the same thing, we call this a permanent magnet. when they're all oriented in diffrent random directions, they're a frequency, not an attraction.

next, I'd like to talk about gravity, which is that we can now start to think of these atoms now as solar systems (I know that some solar systems don't have a star in the middle, ours being one of them), we can now imagine that they are emitting a vibration of their spin is determined by their spinnors, which are objects in relation to another, which now exhibit 720(degress) of rotational difference. again, not to be confused with the solar system itself a spinner.

the difference between the spinnor and the spinner is the perspective. inside of the solar system, everything is a spinnor (having 720(degrees) of difference), however when the solar system looks out, it's perceiving from the magnetic or attractive perspective, which is that things having a similar vibration, will in physicality have similar orientation and similarity of all of it's many multitudes of bits of matter orbiting inside of it.

we can look at ourselves a bit like these solar systems. we've got a lot of matter built up in the form of beliefs about our reality and the people around us. all of these bits of matter orbit a centre point of some sort and all of those internal spinnors are all attracting others with similar vibration. this helps us to understand gravity.

all things that vibrate similarly attract each other.

I think of all magnets as a monopole. imagine this as the top part of a torroidal field (the mushroom bit that extends out like a barbell). let's say that iron spins CW, the N pole is coming *out* in a CW rotation -- well, that means then the S pole is coming now *in* CW also, and so when you have coming out CW next to coming in it experiences attraction. if it's coming out CW and it's next to a coming in CW, it experiences repulsion, much like two fans facing each other would repel each other, but a fan behind another fan will get pulled toward the first fan.

so then when iron is not magnetised all of the iron atoms are all facing random directions. however, when a large magnet influences all of those atoms to face the same direction, then iron becomes magnetised. that's ferro magnetism.

diamagntism is the exact opposite: imagine for a moment that iron spins CW and gold spins CCW -- when gold gets near to magnetised iron, then the spin is opposite, so experiences repulsion -- or diamagnetism.

finally, polarisation of light is just the orientation of the spin of the wave propagating through the medium. I would imagine that polarisers are essentially aligned magnets allowing only same direction rotating waves to pass through.
