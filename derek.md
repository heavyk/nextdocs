hi,
somewhere a while back you said to send a video of novel ways to look at the universe. I lolligagged (is that even a word?) for a while on it because I didn't really want to spend the time to make a video. it's honestly the easiest thing for me to try and think of a video -- as in write out the concept, but the idea of trying to communicate that to an audience is a different thing entirely. I speak plainly, but there are imaginably implications that challenge our conception of consciousness and what it means to be human.

so, since I write best, here we go...

I think of magnetism like a field of really tiny particles that are rotating in in macro movement -- sorta like how a fan turns the air in front of it pushing these little air, or in this case, ether particles around. therefore, when thme fans are facing in the same diretction, they attract each other (imagine them being in a weightless environment with wireless power for the motors) spinning, or from our perspective, vibrating.

so now, we can look to the cosmos and see that the stars are all oriented in a certain direction, that will tell us about this galaxy's magnetism.

if we think of these rotating things like solar systems, it makes the example easier. when all of the spinners (not to be confused with a spinnor) are facing the same thing, we call this a permanent magnet. when they're all oriented in diffrent random directions, those different orientations produce a waveform (like light, think of how it has polarisation), meaning that if you pick one polarisation, then all of the solar systems are all facing in one direction or the other (left spin or right spin). this means that they're a frequency.

---

next, I'd like to talk about gravity which is the opposite side of the same thing. every particle has sub particles and so therefore a lot more higher frequency frequencies. I've heard that the subatomic frequency is quite active compared to the superatomic. I'd like to think of atoms now as solar systems meaning they have different things spinning on the inside together (I know that some solar systems don't have a star in the middle, ours being one of them), however the important thing to note is that they have a vibration to them. our solar system is quite slow and large because it gained a lot of matter (things that we believe are real). I simplify that super complex thing to mean that they have a lot spinning in common. you could imagine that a star like our own would be vibrationally attracted to other stars of similar vibrational composition.

lol, anyway, they are emitting a vibration, and that vibration is determined by their internal spinnors (things in relation to the most dominant -- which you can think of as a giant mass of really high frequency things that have been produced as harmonics of all of these vibrational interactions. I consider these to be from the solar system's perspective of the dominant one looking in, every object is in relation to th dominant and which now exhibit 720(degress) of rotational difference. again, not to be confused with the solar system itself a spinner when looking out from an attraction point of view.

I say attraction, because like the synchronising metronomes, all things that are of a similar enough vibration (meaning they share a medium), then begin to affect each other's vibrations. you attract everyone who is more than 50% similar to you in vibration, and would it not be for the repelling (gravity force) then all things would collide.

the frequency that you emit is the composition of all of the matter that's inside of you. all of the matter is your beliefs. you believe in this stuff. it's real. when you go outside you see it because it's reql. you are vibrationally sympathetic to it in some way. if it's here and it's not disappearing, then it's attracted. attraction and repulsion are the same force; only a measure of difference in harmony and dissonance.

one more try: the difference between the spinnor and the spinner is the perspective. inside of the solar system, everything is a spinnor (having 720(degrees) of difference), however when the solar system looks out, it's perceiving from the magnetic or attractive perspective, which is that things having a similar vibration (spinner), which, in physicality, often times have similar orientation and similarity of all of it's many multitudes of bits of matter orbiting inside of it.

we can look at ourselves a bit like these solar systems. we've got a lot of matter built up in the form of beliefs about our reality and the people around us. all of these bits of matter orbit a centre point of some sort and all of those internal spinnors are all attracting others with similar vibration. this helps us to understand gravity.

all things that vibrate similarly attract each other.

I've also done some inquiry into the sun and carbon (they both share a similar vibrational lattice, hexagonal planar) and that stuff is fascinating. hydrogen, I don't it is quite what we think it is. I'm having to redo my own concepts of it, even as we speak.

you know this is probably the 4th or 5th rendering of the idea and this time especially, I noticed a lot of things that were already outdated. you can render any concept you want into something physical if you want to. just write about it and let it flow. it's a cultivated skill that starts, for me at least, with writing down my emotions, then concepts, then emotions in relation to concepts, until I can just start to write about the concept.

it's looking at you all of the time (these are very high frequency things, but not quite subatomic). I call it the conceptual realm. it's probably somewhere past gamma or something physically speaking, but these concepts exist in a relatively stable self-perpetuating structures which can be interacted with frequentially. our mind is exceptionally well suited for it, but I had to be able to turn down the noise by understanding it. when I understood all the noise, meaning that nothing really bothers me anymore, then I always get a clear signal. I can tell by how I feel.

I think of all magnets as a monopole. imagine this as the top part of a torroidal field (the mushroom bit that extends out like a barbell). let's say that iron spins CW, the N pole is coming *out* in a CW rotation -- well, that means then the S pole is coming now *in* CW also, and so when you have coming out CW next to coming in it experiences attraction. if it's coming out CW and it's next to a coming in CW, it experiences repulsion, much like two fans facing each other would repel each other, but a fan behind another fan will get pulled toward the first fan.

so then when iron is not magnetised all of the iron atoms are all facing random directions. however, when a large magnet influences all of those atoms to face the same direction, then iron becomes magnetised. that's ferro magnetism.

diamagntism is the exact opposite: imagine for a moment that iron spins CW and gold spins CCW -- when gold gets near to magnetised iron, then the spin is opposite, so experiences repulsion -- or diamagnetism.

finally, polarisation of light is just the orientation of the spin of the wave propagating through the medium. I would imagine that polarisers are essentially aligned magnets allowing only same direction rotating waves to pass through.
