# form of life thoughts

I started reading "forms of life" by eugene mccarthy, and I haven't even made it to page one yet and I'm already starting to get a bunch of ideas flooding into my head. I plan on writing them down here as I go.

### explosions of life

there are various points in the fossil record that show massive explosions of life. following my notes in @[blahblog](2022-05-07 13:47), where I talk about the sun being a sort of enabler of desire to manifest into the physical.

one of the things that I talked about was the idea that some female part of the DNA is used to kind of mix two things (I'm probably saying this all wrong), to make a frequency capable of incarnating the new desired form. I used the example of a woman having sex with an unsavory type and either transferring his energy to someone who can turn that unsavoryness into something wanted (something I'm very good at). this is the basic idea of the triad[^1] as the female transfers one male emitter's energy to the other male ground and then back to the emitter once the ground has transformed it.

OK, that's not what I wanted to talk about.

so imagine that the sun is doing its best to emit vibrations that will allow the new desired form to manifest, but there is some sort of resistance to this desire in the form of environmental conditions. in the case of atlantis and tower of babel, I believe they constructed a bunch of machines that would harmonise the earth's vibrations (saturnian energy), and this reduced the number of changes that could happen.

the sense that I get is that they used box-consciousness techniques to transform all of solar energy this planet is receiving into a certain harmonious vibration resonant with the boxes and this was a frequency which could be received by the part of the cell (mitochondria?) that inputs solar energy and outputs some sort of energy usable to the cell. as a result, hybrid forms could be sustained that would otherwise fall apart. those hybrid forms stopped being viable after a solar outburst.

I don't fully understand the mechanism, but I think the precursor to these explosions is a large quantity of oxygen in the atmosphere. it seems that oxygen's interaction with magnetic fields may be the driver to cause the sun to produce a "correction" -- as in, when the oxygen begins to vibrate unharmoniously, this affects the crystals in the planet and induces corresponding magnetic fields. it seems that a precursor to these major explosions is often/always(?) an overabundance of oxygen, then probably a solar outburst, which creates a new environment compatible with the new forms (ie. harmonious with the frequency of the new form of perception the new form will have).

what I mean is, I'm reading all of these ancient accounts of hybrids, and I have to think that a lot of this happened when there was not a spoken language; instead, it was visual/conceptual. so if you wanted describe something, they didn't have adjectives like we have in english -- instead, they constructed a picture and showed the person. so, if you wanted to show someone that they're angry, you'd show them their behaviour in picture form, and they'd say, "yeah that's me" -- so, to describe their behaviour to them, known forms and archetypes have to be used -- like, a lion is teritorial and ferocious, a fox is sly and cunning, etc. -- and you'd construct these images to show the person their behaviour is similar to a lion, bull, or whatever.

so imagine in a high energy environment, you want a human, but you want them to be forceful like a bull, so you breed a human with a bull, and out comes a human that perceives life like a mixture of a human and a bull. the sense that I get in this enumeration of ancient hybrids was to take a human and breed in an aspect of an animal to alter that human's perception, so they would be "part human, part snake, part goat" -- or whatever -- thereby endowing them with the wisdom of a snake and the self-centredness of a goat.

I'm trying to look at this backwards because (that I know of), there are no known methods to create fossils -- however, I propose that fossilisation is the same process of petrification where some rapid influx of protons(?) allows for a large number of carbon atoms to gain desity so rapidly that they jump a row in the periodic table going from carbon to silicate.

so imagine that you have something that is emitting a lot of this energy -- like an activated stone box -- and wood could slowly petrify in its presence, but if you had a large influx of this energy, you could petrify an entire forest.

I think fossilisation is the same technique, when the body has no suitable mechanism to convert that energy into something useful, so it gains density rapidly and solidifies. I've been paying attention to the weeds in the back, and the ones I have are much more dense than otherwise they should be -- as in, if I were to take one of the weeds and dry it out, it would be a lot lighter than the weeds that have been there all year. they're very dense and stand straight up surviving hailstorms. I could imagine that if whatever happened last year happened on a bigger scale, we would have a yard of petrified weeds.

this same process is the same one which causes plants to grow, btw, as I've also noticed that the flowers were dug up and sitting around, and some time a few months ago, everything bloomed all of a sudden, and the dug up flowers started to get green. the energy was neutralised, and now they're the bright white color of the petrified weeds. what I think is happening there was when the big bloom happened, there was a lot of harmonious energy in the air and so everything sprang to life, but since that energy has become unharmonious and so therefore with nothing useful to do with that vibration of energy, they've gained density rapidly.

so, putting it all together, I think the fossil records are the organisms that were not compatible with the new solar regime... wait lemme back up. first, there was a growing majority of oxygen in the atmosphere that was resisting change, then, finally enough magnetic field attracted a large CME which then converted a lot of that oxygen into water, the oxygen levels[^2] dropped, and now the new frequency is getting through. the forms that required large amounts of oxygen will asfixiate, and the forms incapable of converting that new solar vibration into energy gain density rapidly and turn into stone.

[1]: interestingly enough, one of the major triads has this conflict built right into it, where isis (-2 like the sun) will be in conflict with ra (+3) -- and so osiris (+-6-+) takes this non-physical conflict and turns it into a physical one (the conflict between the imagination/astral (6) and the physical (7)).

[2]: I'm using the word oxygen, because it seems to me to happen both when CO2 and O2 get high. also, I've seen those CO2 clouds turn unnaturally rapidly into dark moisture clouds too, so some energetic process can turn CO2 into water -- though I'm not sure how.
