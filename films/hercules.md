### 2023-04-02 12:10 - unrealistic meg

I find meg in this film *highly* unrealistic. hades says that she made a deal with hades to save her boyfriend, but then her boyfriend repaid her by taking off with another girl.

first of all, this is a super common flaw in reasoning related tto mutual-back-scratching. by saving him, she expected to have some sort of possession over him, intending to keep him around because of the "debt" that he owes her. obvious mistake, but we've all done it thinking that by doing a favour for someone, we'll get them to grant our desire.

the real problem with this scenario though, is that me (kenny) personally have never met a woman that has gone to the lengths to save another man, only to have him run off on her. it's certainly possible that women exist where this exact situation has happend, but I haven't met a single one.

I understnad this juxtaposition though in the story (much like herc's "where I belong" bit), because it's a fore-telling of the opposite thing. later, meg at the fountain where the muses are singing to her telling her she is, in fact in love with him (but she expects it to end poorly), and at the end of the song, they give her back the white lily that herc gave her at the end of the previous scene. the white lily is a symbol for the saviour of the world, as it features in a number of shakespere's plays and I've seen it in "countess kathleen" by yeats as well, so it's pretty well established. the rose is red and 5 but the lily I think is either 4 or 6 and white. there's a balance in there. and then, sure enough, at the end she throws herself in front of the pillar so tthat hades' deal of "she won't get hurt" will be broken and herk will get his god power back, effectively saving him.

in reality, the way that I've experienced women is never that they could evven get to the saving possiblity (unless he's a real dolt), because all along the way, she'll be trying so hard to make him see her for the awful person that she really is all along the way (at least, that's been my experience, anyway). she seems to be impressed by his pectorals and appearance and knows that appearance alone isn't enough of a solid foundation for a "good" guy to stand on, and so she *expects* things to go wrong after the infatuation of the appearance wears off. the other thing is she feels like she needs to *hide* how insufficient she really is -- yet, and that works well in this film because herk isn't very perceptive; I however, am pretty perceptive, so it's pretty plainly obvious to me the opposite: which is that by hiding the things that make her insufficient, she's actually trying to convince me of her insufficiency. I'll give an example...

imagine for a moment that I believed that I'm a terrible programmer and I'm around a bunch of other programmers that are significantly better than I am. personally I would learn from them, but imagine for a moment that I didn't want them to know how bad of a programmer I was -- and so I try to use the buzzwords tthat they use, talk like they do and relate to my programming problems like they do. I'm an actor and I'm emulating the behaviour of a good programmer, because I want to *seem* like I know what I'm doing even though I still don't yet have it quite well down as they do.

by trying to imitate them, for a person that only looks at the key aspects like are they saying the right words and stuff will easly be bamboozled by someone like that -- but you can always tell a person that actually knows what they're doing because their mistakes look effortless. for an actor, a mistake looks like a big problem, but for someone familiar with the instrument, a mistake is like a jazz musician just kinda using it as inspiration to angle into the next bit. by watching a person make a mistake and recover from it, it's fairly easy to notice how relaxed they feel in the situation, and that comfort comes off as confidence.

when I see a mistake in myself and it causes a big upset, it also causes a big upset for the other person as well, and it's that upset where I perceive the other person as trying to convince me (perhaps not the best words) of their inadequacy. just watch a new mom and she's super scared to make a mistake with the child, but a mother who's had a few children will be much better at letting the kid make it through without pefect cconditions and parenting.

interesting. now, let's talk about overconfidence. "overconfidence" is where you're confident beyond your feeling -- meaning let's say that you have a feeling of uneasiness, yet you go ahead and do something anyway because you want to *prove yourself* to your friends or those watching. when I act within the feeling where I am, I'm just confident -- but feigning that I feel better about something than I *actually* feel about it, is when things tend to go wrong.

in this film, meg is thinks that things are going *too good* and believes that they're going to end poorly after herk figures out who she really is. again, I find this unrealistic, because in my experience the girlfriends for the guys that I knew tended to be a little more optimistic about their situation. they have a feeling that their boyfriend/husband is doing something that she doesn't want, but she instead tries to lie to herself that things are going fine, and that she's the real reason why he's not sufficiently satisfied with her and has to look elsewhere. the one glaring example of this was luke and maria: luke wasn't really interested in pursuing other girls *at all* -- and it was actually maria that kept --- OH, I see now: what's happening is that the one that's dominant is the one that's going to be suspected of going off in a different direction; because, the domininant one is the one making the decisions of where he/she wants to go, and so at any moment, (it's feared that) they could just up and leave.

the only time that meg takes intitiative, it then appears that she's the one playing herk, because she's the one taking him out on that night. again, pretty unrealistic IMO, because I don't typically ever experience any dominant women and instead, I find that most women have this *expectation* that I'll somehow be able to fulfil their desire.

btw, expetation and narrative are pretty much the same thing: if I write a story or poem about some amazing thing happening to me, that is an expression of both my belief in what is (maginally, in a fairy tale universe) posssible, and also of my desire of what I wish *would* happen in such a fairy tale universe. you'll notice that that's the SAME THING as an expectation: which is a desire/fear and a belief of what will happen. expectations are usually perceived from the negative angle though, like "if I ask him something, he's just going to say no or think I'm a noob". the desire is to ask something (and not get looked down upon) but the belief is that he will just say no or think I'm a noob. just sometthing to think about :)

### 2023-04-02 15:34 - mixed alone messages

> herk: meg, when I'm with you, I don't feel so alone
> meg: sometimes it's better to be alone
> herk: what do you mean?
> meg: nobody can hurt you
> herk: meg, I would never ever hurt you

this dialoge over the inner conflict I believe is a bit unrealistic as well. in the dialogue, meg suggests to herk that he should be alone so that *she doesn't get hurt by him* (put your sweater on; I'm cold). so then, herk follows it up by assuring her that he will never hurt her.

I find this dialoge unrealistic because the underlying issue is not about hurt but about her not wanting him to see her how she sees her. what I mean is, when he's alone, he sees her the way that he wants to see her. however, when he's with her, she *will*, dispite her best intentions to pretend she's not the way she thinks she is, eventually convince him to see her the way that she sees herself. this is *actually* the hurt that she's talking about.

meg's false sense of self was (pretty accurately I might say) portrayed in their first encounter when he saves her from the monster. in that scene, she's pretending to be strong and that she'll be fine by herself (not alone).
