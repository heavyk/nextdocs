can't you see how awesome it is...
to do bigger and bigger things?
from my persepective I just keep wanting to make bigger and bigger things. I can't help but to contiually enjoy infinity... what I want is just to make bigger and bigger things. all I can think about is how to think of something in a higher dimensional way.

OH, you mean that I should allow anyone that I want to have my genetics...? that's the idea, yeah. I want to make my own setup the new baseline model. I'm fairly certain that all colours, shapes and sizes are available. it's gonna be madness. I'll have zillions of body doubles, even though only some look like me. fun :)

body double!, double double!
body double! double! double!, !double !double,
double! double! double!

it's just so much fun seeing bigger and bigger things.
I love higher and higher frequencies, all the time.
life is actually fun.

some might say that I shouldn't give anyone the easy way out. right? wouldn't you want to figure it out for yourselves? personally I like figuring out things, but I have no problems to copy the base design from someone else. I copy everything. please copy! like a virus, and see!

you *are* who you are,
no mater wherevr ye be
this feels so strange,
I thought you could see

no mater wherevr you are,
you *are* who you see
you and me both,
we all like to see.

be what you want, be what you be
don't evr expec't anyone to be,
not even me.

I don't have to any reason to be,
any thing you want me to be,
I retire what you be.

I'm only doing the things I want to be doing,
stopp messing with me...jiji

carrying his load on his back,
from the ninteenth into the twentieth centurie.
we've got an arduous road to go,
so heavy and bleak.

we're only in the 10th century, anyway lul
ode to atlas, woe!
such a heavy load on his back,
so heavy and bleak.
