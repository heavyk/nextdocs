I'm 4/14th of the way done with reading the lost book of enki now and I just wanted to write some ideas down. I was going to do it last night, but decided to sleep on it a night.

I really get the sense that sitchin's translation is really good. the "chariots" for example seem to be a type of ship that can only travel on the ecliptic and therefore has to do many circles in the neutral magnetic zone at the equator to slow its inertia to ascend/descend to the planet. because it was confined to only equatorial motion, the "hammered braclet" asteroid belt was a serious problem for those early models. in contrast, the "rocketship" seems to have a system of propulsion and can fly "over" the astroids instead of having to push its way through. it's nice to see those kinds of distinctions, and altogether I feel the translation is really good. there was one more thing I noticed buc can't remember now.

now, about its contents: the story is really good -- almost too good. second, it seems that nibiru has a lot of the elements that ancient mars had. remember that one CIA report on the remote viewing target of mars 1M BC?

the next thing that caught my attention was the alalu character. in the sirian guide, he fits the description very well of jeortau. I do think the giant face on mars was his tomb. the other convienient thing it explains is why anu doesn't have manparts -- cause he bit them off and swallowed them, right? well, the triad is anu/anatau, jeortau/alalu, sanatau/enki/ptah. I think anu is just a really masculine female.

there's another insistance that this narrative has which I noticed, which is that the planets are given importance (named after the nobility), and a lot are given female status. for example antu (the wife of anu) is the same planet as enki, neptune. the sun (apsu) is also once again masculine, and in some cases mates with the planets, but this is a bit weird because not all the planets are feminine.

the female planet also seems to be an excuse to explain tiamat's production of 11 moons, the foremost, kingu, our moon today. the whole kingu thing seems to be a cover story. I'm hesitant to write out this idea already until I know more, but here's my initial idea on it.

the history is cyclical. the same events appear over and over in smaller and smaller bits. this is a key point to the story, and they call these cyclical "unavoidable" events, "destinies". planets and people seem to have them. jeortau, I believe is the origin of the "tower of babel" story as he tried to raise a tower that would rival the gods.

the sense I get is that jeortau/alalu/lucifer decided to split from the martian leadership and he went to the planet zyron/nibiru (perhaps earth as well) and started his own setup. his technology became better and better, rivaling and surpassing the martians, and so then he set nibiru on a very "lofty" (enlongated) highly elevated orbit that made him far superior to the martians and all the other planets in the galaxy. it's quite likely that he used some sort of technology to create moons and other things (matter creation), whereas the martians seemingly understood matter destruction (carving rocks through subtraction and cutting, etc.).

the martians obviously had to put a stop to this, so they began to do something that caused a whole lot of damage. this seemed to have done a lot of damage to mars (the reason for its atomosphere hole), and to earth as well.

there is this important part in the book about the "destinies" and the ability to alter the desitiny of a planet (it's orbit), and I get the feeling that this was being manipulated and is what caused nibiru/zyron to disturb so many other planet's orbits and do so much destruction. you know how velikovski suggests that somehow venus turned into a comet, but has no method of explaining how? well, imagine for a moment that "moses" had access to the great pyramid and (like this book explains), alter the "destiny" of venus so that it would begin to create close approaches to earth. well, same thing, cept imagine for a moment that the martians also had the capability to alter the orbits of other planets.

so then just like the martian leadership is doing to me, imagine for a moment that I'm tiamat/nibiru and I want to go to a very elevated and lofty orbit (kinda like pluto is becoming) because at an incline, I'm off of the ecliptic and therefore difficult to reach by "chariot", and being so "lofty" (long period) it starts to get too costly for them to control. out there I begin to create a number of small planets (probably the beginning of a new solar system -- we're gonna do it our own way in our own system). the martians don't want that, so they start pulling my orbit into the system closer and closer where they can control it again. this greatly destabilises the "destiny" of the planet as the tug-of-war increases.

it's pretty likely that they weren't winning the war, so they murdered alalu/lucifer eventually to finally win the tug-of-war. after that happened, with alalu no longer around to guide the planet, nibiru/tiamat/zyron's "destiny" came blasting through the solar system, knocking nearly everything down as it passed.

to kind of smoothe over the murder, they probably celebrated him, turned him into a holiday, named a some things after him, etc. and then they do like they always do: make a giant monument/memorial to comemorate the problematic one to their narrative they had to take out (jfk, mlk, etc).

that was the first destruction of mankind (we were too smart and too good at everything). this caused a lot of difficulty and division, so probably the north and south division said to have happened on nibiru, was actually an event that happened on mars. the strife wars and difficulty are likely what caused the decrease in magnetic field and problem in the atmosphere on *mars*, not nibiru. nibiru/zyron/tiamat probably had a really good atmosphere with very thriving and healthy people.

I find it likely that lucifer's phase actually had a purpose. in et-view-of-creation, kuthumi talks about how there were still a lot of INFECTED ONES that didn't get caught up into bodies and were still around on other galaxies in permanent astral form. lucifer's planet of very healthy and vibrant humans with a decent, clear-headed leader that rivaled the martians was probably a very attractive thing for those other INFECTED ONES that were still out and about. all of the opportunistic power hungry ones flooded into the martian bodies, but I find it likely that the other more neutral (I like nice things, but I don't necessarily need to destroy others to get those good conditions that I need to feel good, types), and the good and bad sides were created. the good condition needers may have also been artificially created by lucifer as well, to sort of group of "good fallen angels" to keep the conflict going.

---

there's another serious problem with the narrative that tells me that it's a narrative rather than a historical account is the time problem. supposedly a "shar" is 3600y and that was the orbital period of nibiru. when they go to earth, after sending word, they decide to go back, but they wait *a whole shar* until the planet is near to the sun again. that's 3600y. they also say the sun rises and sets very rapidly on earth (let's say it's something equivalent to 6h day), but they don't really talk about earth days until the "7 days of creation" -- in which, if the days were that short, they seemed to have accomplished a lot in those very short days, but then decide to wait 3600 more revolutions around the sun, but all they filled was a few basketfuls of gold. my goodness, if the days were as productive as they were in the 7 days of creation, they should have got a lot more than that.

I don't wish to outline all of the time issues, but they are quite numerous. I've been thinking about this whole mars 1Mya remote viewing thing and if that's the case, something had to have taken up all of that time. the sirians say that time has been slowed down a whole bunch here, over and over, the final aspect of it is the physical (the most stagnant) and its reciprocal: desire/random/chaos. so imagine for a moment that the earth has turned around the sun 1M times since then, there must have occurred a time where lots and lots of time passed, but day/night cycles were not observed.

I find it likely that whatever lucifer was doing must have introduced a technology that allowed them to begin to fix a frequency and then build up an atmosphere using that technique. I think they did that on mars and they must have also done it on earth, too. I think it would have made a very thick barrier (a sort of greenhouse) which keeps heat in so it doesn't get too cold, and also keeps the sun rays out too. likely the whole planet was filled with lots and lots of CO2 and so the whole place emitted an even white light, so they had no knowledge of the days (rotation of the planet), and so only counted in years. that's the only possible explanation I can make of so much time passage.

it'd be interesting to see someone remote view mars 100-200kya. I would guess that the martians have built a lot of structures and have a vibrant atmosphere at that time. they then broght that technology to earth and upon it, they founded the atlantis empire.

---

speaking of which, atlantis isn't really mentioned so far. I have a feeling that "edin" is atlantis, and that is where enlil sets up his ... OH, the reactions are telling me that's balbek. maybe it's tied in with the americas... I dunno yet

---

the last thing that has impressed me by this book is how it seems like the same history repeats itself. I'll assemble a better outline soon, but this seems to be the entire intention of the author. it has some funny and convenient narratives that make a good story, but it feels to me that the author is trying to say that there is a pattern that repeats over and over, and one may consider this to be like the "destiny" of a planet, but the destiny of a planet can be altered, and so therefor isn't "set in stone" -- even though they were stone tablets engraved with the planets' destinies. so, a person's trajectory through time is more like a "fate".

I don't know how to explain, but it feels like this document was given to a scribe as a means to essentially compress time. I have another theory even more radical than the one above which is where this document enabled "God" to create the world and everything in it in only 6ky, allowing us to have the massive time compression we see today. that one is going to take me a bit to explain, but maybe lucifer is going for a galaxy instead of just a solar system this time, but instead of having to do anything, it all becomes effortless because this is the 7th day (of rest).

### 2022-05-23 16:56 - alalu and tiamat (take two)

I realised a few problems with the way that I conveyed the story the last time. I'm also not certain about the location of nibiru.

the sirians said that the three planets suitable for life were earth, mars, and zyron (where the hammered bracelet is now). thy planned to move the INFECTED ONES to earth, so they got earth ready for that creating the animals and like that would occupy the planet there. the INFECTED ONES were to be drawn to mars, and these I believe were all the really power hungry ones that had taken up physical forms elsewhere in the galaxy and are flying around in astral form.

interestingly, jehovih in oahspe relays a very similar story about the creation of earth, designed to contain lots of angels that would take on human form that would then mate with the early humans, and become their guardian angels. the other interesting coincidence with jehovih is the 3600y "shar" -- which is very similar to his [3000y harvest cycle](/oahspe/thoughts.md#the-harvest), so I don't fully know what that is, though I will say that oahspe seems to round things to multiples of 5 and 10 to as many signifcant digits as possible, however -- the sumerian stuff seems to capitalise on multiples of 3, which seems to make sense because the martians supposedly had 6 fingers on each hand, while we have 5. my calculator won't convert the numbers to base 6/12 for me, and I don't feel like writing a program to figure it out. I know they use a base 60 number system, so that's just 60x60 (sorta like 100x100 is for us). that could explain the "shar" cycle. jehovih explains it as going through periods of high light (hi’dan) and lower light, but to my knowledge doesn't explain the mechanism, or if this is a planet or solar system-wide phenomena.

---

the way that tiamat is explained, it is a single planet that has 11 moons around it, the foremost being kingu. so you have tiamat and kingu as the big ones, and then around it a bunch of smaller ones. in my mind, this looks like a solar system. the picture I get is the image that tesla had of essentially igniting the upper atmosphere of the planet so that we would have power everywhere (like being inside of a capacitor) and also daylight glow everwhere (if the atmosphere was filled with sufficient CO2) as well.

as I mentioned, I think that the technology to create an atmosphere[^1] and charge the lower atmosphere in a way to hold that upper atmosphere -- to actually fix the martain atmosphere. so, in a way, he was the first "saviour" -- and that's why the story paints him as a "now that I've saved the atmosphere breach on nibiru, now I want to be king" -- sorta way. also, like I mentioned, I believe they used the same technology on earth.

alalu's technology was certainly as different of an implementation to what enki eventually adapted it to be, as the great pyramid was different to the teotihuacan pyramids. it seems that enki is constantly adapting some kind of technology to that alalu is coming up with.

there's also the part where alalu figures out how to make his way through the hammered bracelet using "weapons of terror" -- which, really makes me wonder -- why didn't anyone try this before? I haven't read much about the weapons of terror yet, but they were using them to try and get the volcanos to spew (more CO2) out into the atmosphere again so their plants would grow. sitchin translates this as nuclear weapons, but I don't think it was nuclear. I think it was an energy weapon that has some effect of putting consciousness into overdrive (something like a psychedellic), and these weapons, being great enhancers of mental capacity were probably the same "fire" that was used to ignite the atmosphere of tiamat and turn it into a star.

the martians have outlawed the use of fire, so enki finds a way through the asteroid belt, not with fire, but with *water*. I believe that enki did a similar conversion of alalu's upper environment enhancer, not to create fire barrier, but to create a *water* barrier -- a sort of firmament to protect the planet from the rays of the sun.

it looks to me like alalu wants to build things with fire that enhance mental capabilities, but enki wants to build the same thing but with water, which dampens the attractive power[^2].

the destruction of zyron in the book is explained with tiamat getting broken into two. this doesn't really make sense, because if you took a second earth and blew it to bits, it doesn't seem like it would create the amount of asteroids that are in the asteroid belt (plus all the ones that went cometary).

what seems more likely to have happened is that the entire planet of zyron was blown to bits (probably using the weapons of terror), and in the process earth took a real good wack in the pacific ocean sinking the contenent of pan/lemuria and wiping out civilisation on the planet at the time[^3]. I don't know what happened to the other moons, but it seems that kingu was an especially useful moon, but remember they can alter the "destinies" of the planets, so kingu got moved to the earth to become, probably a monitoring station or a regulator of some type.

---

quick sidebar about the moon: if I were alalu and I wanted to create a solar system, I would probably be doing it mostly in mental space, and then let the mental artifacts attract the physicality that responds to their attraction. so, you can imagine that there are 10 planets that exist, not yet in the physical form but only in the astral. the moon probably regulated these. I don't know why I think it, but if you imagine the sun is a -2 system, and then there is zyron, and then there is a bunch of planets that exist only in the astral realm, there needs to be a sort of transformer that steps the sun's energy down to astral frequencies in order to sustain the energy for the planets until they're fully formed.

in the legends of egypt, the earth gains 5 days (spins faster), the moon rises in brightness, and 5 new children are born. those 5 new children may have been the same previous 5 visible planets, but now with the moon's astral lens, they appear different. not sure about this.

anyway, my point is that alalu/jeortau is a (2), which is what connects anu/anatau (1) to enki/sanatau (3). so if zyron is (+2) and the planet is caused to become attractive using these "weapons of terror", the planet would become very bright and sorta look like the planet venus, becoming a (-2+), which means he needs the opposite implementation of himself below the midpoint, which is the astral (6), which the physical implementation of that is the moon. it essentially trangulates the sun (-2) and zyron/alalu (+2) and the moon (+-6-+). later, the same pattern is repeated in person with osiris (+-6-+) and his wife isis (-2) or asta, which means star.

it's possible that the imagery of osiris being broken to bits is a temporal resonance or yet another "proof" of the cyclical "destinies" that the planets interactions play out on earth.

---

the final subject here is that I noticed that alalu/jeortau/teonackaeeon seems to be constantly associated with the "saviour" bit. it looks like what happens is he gets all proud and decides, "forget you guys and your dumb laws, I'm gonna do it myself" and then he sets out to do something that he wants to do. the discomfort that this causes eventually causes a split. one of the splits goes in the direction of whatever he was creating -- so there probably is a solar system out there somewhere in the galaxy with the centre of it originally being the planet zyron. likewise, there's also pretty likely another version of earth out there where the americas came to enlightenment and went on to do great things (and this is the vision that I believe that terence had).

however, those were very incompatible realities for the martians and romans and so it produced a split. let me explain the split again cause I see it now clearer than I ever have before.

so imagine for a moment one of the splits, which is the one of the "tower of babel". we can't really tell if the tower of babel was the first or the second meltwater rise recorded, though there may be some that know, it's possible that the tower of babel actually was the first one, then, like I think happened with enki and alalu, enki took the technology and converted it to the atlantian/martian way of thinking and that's how the great pyramid was constructed. I'm ahead of myself.

so let's just say that jeortau/alalu finds a way to get anatau/anu's technology into the physical, but the problem is it's based on fire. that produces an incompatible reality and so there is a split. alalu goes off as a solar system or whatever and they're successful in creating what's wanted. they gain the capacity to see timelines and notice that the other side of the split encountered a cataclysm because of all of the dissatisfacton. they then sabotage theirselves in the timeline, allowing the martians to defeat and stop their project from advancing, and so jump into the self-sabotage timeline. enki/sanatau then takes that technology and converts it into a format which is compatible with the martian mindset (like water -- not an amplifer, but a dampener)

in the case of jesus, the same thing happens, but instead of technology, it was genetics for them to continue to maintain their existance.

it appears that the goal for alalu/jeortau is to keep trying to get the necessary technology into their hands which allows them to continue to not change their perspective. each successive time, he siphons off the ones that want to see wanted into bigger and bigger creations, and then jumps back in to make an even bigger one.

one time it created another solar system, but that "failed" (or did it?) and then another time a system here on earth of transmuting things into wanted -- and all of those people have seemingly vanished without a trace (bermuda-411 style). I think the renaissance was also a success, too. out there somewhere, they're living high culture and elevated consciousness. I think they've figured out that this is the most happening place because of the incredible time compression, and so all you have to do is just give them the power to try and stop the creation, and then they will. any type of large creation can be created, just you have to become the creation that you want to be.

---

let me explain this a little better: if all creations are a reflection of you, you just need to be vibrationally harmonious to whatever it is that you want, and then that reality will eventually happen. as soon as it's incompatible with their reality (as in something that disrupts their business-as-usual), they have to try and prevent it. they can't prevent it forever though as it'll eventually happen. when that happens, a split will happen. likely in the split (given enough time) we'll come to find a way to perceive timelines, and so then we'll have the option of sabotaging ourselves to see what the bigger more evolved version of what we want is. we can do this for as long as we can find ways to sabotage ourselves.

---

this one has an interesting set of reactions to it because I'm kinda introducing a second set of "good-guys" into the equation. it's not just enki vs enlil. I think that enlil and friends are just the catalyst. what I mean is that enlil causes enki to find new forms of technology which are compatible with the tech (water) mindset. his son (I think), thoth puts that into order and ritual, which is the 7th ray path. alalu seems to be interested with the conceptual perceptual (fire) path. neither one is bad or worse.

in my thinking about this alalu guy, I'm beginning to realise I align a lot more with alalu than with enki. kinda interesting actually, because -- like I said in other places, I find the 2nd ray path to be detestable.

[1]: in order to hold up a firmament or something an opposite polarity charge needs to be put to keep the layer separated. like, you can't just have chaotic convection all over the place -- you'd need clearly defined layers demarcated by some spherical resonator

[2]: again, this book seems to be a commentary on the difference between fate/attraction vs destiny/cycles, where both appear certain, but both can be altered, one with mentality/emotion and the other with cycles/vibrations -- which is sorta looking at the same thing, considering mentality and emotions are also vibrations

[3]: this is probably why there are so many "OOPArts" that are under millions and millions of years of sediment, the weird artifacts in coal, etc.

### 2022-05-27 04:34 - judging alalu at right hand of the father

(written earlier, I moved it here, because it's less notes and more of an opinion peice)

I noticed in the judging of alalu, enki is seated at the right of anu (the father), and enlil on the left.

well, it's interesting considering the connection that I made between alalu and jeortau with the dove symbolism, because later on in the bible jesus says (mat 26:64)

> hereafter, ye shall see the son of man seated at the right hand of power [father?] and coming in the clouds

not the verse I was looking for. there's another in rom 8:33-34 that's intreresting. I'm not finding what I'm looking for so I'll just explain it:

first of all, I think that alalu went and made a successful colony of humans that were superior to the annunaki, and so alalu got murdered and destroyed with the weapons of terror that they're so against using. that's why this story, if you read it with this lens is all about the "vengenance" of alalu for getting his planet blown up with weapons of terror. this is a cover story to hide a number of things.

I think anu was already a girl, and so his biting off his malehood was just a cover story[^2] to explain away an assertive woman in power before a culture could accept it[^1].

it's quite possible that enlil has a heavy hand in this story because the end of the has him and enki all super buddy-buddy and wondering if history will repeat itself.

---

so, in this judgment scene, they go to great lengths to judge alalu and condemn him (in this story) for (I believe) making a superior race of beings and planetary environment (compared to nibiru which is failing). basically, they're pissed that he isn't saving their atmosphere problem, and instead peaced out to make his own setup on another planet. if there are three habitable planets[^5], mars/nibiru, zyron/tiamat, and earth -- and alalu goes and makes a superior setup on tiamat instead of saving nibiru, he's essentially, *not* their saviour, and mars needs saving, so they destroy tiamat and alalu. the only planet remaining now is earth[^4] cause tiamat is gone and mars is in bad shape, so the annunaki saviour position goes to enki and the earth.

I find further evidence of this is the ridiculous claims that alalu wanted to become the king of nibiru if he was going to save the planet. I think that's exactly the opposite of what I think happened -- which is that he peaced out of the mars/nibiru disaster and took off for zyron to do his own thing. he was probably very successful and so to watch someone else peace out of your situation and to thrive probably pissed them off further -- which then I believe they (probably enlil) felt they had no choice to use weapons of terror to destroy tiamat, so he gets judged and condemned for being successful instead of saving them. they need to condemn alalu's selfish behaviour.

so then, in the bible when jesus is constantly presented at the one that is seated at the right hand of the father feels to me like a symbolic thing where he's equated with enki here.

I believe that the reception of the dove after his baptism was the reception of this jeortau energy. so, to explain that, a 2nd ray has all of the qualities of a 3rd ray, but when a third ray (enki) approaches it from that perspective, the 3rd ray sees parts and pieces, and the 2nd ray sees the whole, and that we're all connected and each of our actions influence the other, so the scene there is kinda like enlil (who is clearly 7th ray), anu (1st), and enki (3rd) are judging a 2nd ray for being selfish.

this is something like a the part of an organisation that's failing, condeming another organisation for being successful.

it's hard to describe the concept that I received from this because let's just assume that enlil is a 7th ray -- so basically allayandra/mars -- well, jesus is basically enlil+anu (allayandra+anatau) combined with jeortau/alalu (ater the baptism). it's the progression from a 1-3-7 to a l-2-7, which is a big difference.

[1]: seems this is a repeating occurance of dressing a woman up as a dude to allow her to have power. it feels very similar to hatshepsut and senmut, then again with akhenaten and nefertiti.

[2]: it has all of the classic elements that assure you of its validity, because they wrestle naked, so in the mental image conveyed in the mind[^3] anu is a man and you combine it with the grotesque image of someone losing and getting poisoned by such a potent king's malehood. the graphic image impresses the mind and makes it more real. this is hollywood presentation of a narrative but for ancients.

[3]: I think their language conjures images in the mind of the symbols presented -- cause that's what it does for me even reading the english translation of it. once I get into the mindset of the writer, the story is very visual for me.

[4]: this cover story narrative I'm painting here totally changes the flooding event narrative, because the big problem for enlil is that earth is the only option remaining and it feels to me like he doesn't want to lose that only option  remaining (earth), but on the other side, he also feels no other option than to destroy the humans cause they threaten his only option (earth). so he is forced to decide between two "only options" (which I think is kinda funny because he doesn't have any options because its all attraction).

[5]: see @[sitchin/thoughts](2022-05-27 02:53)

### 2022-05-27 02:53 - nibiru thoughts

some reactions wondering then what I think nibiru planet actually is. it does seem there is evidence for something coming into the solar system and knocking a lot of planets over, and so I'm claiming that it was mars that did all of that?

well, I don't really know, but I do think that is a definite possibility. this book has two major emphasises that it makes: first, that a destiny is different than a fate, and second, that weapons of terror are not a good way to get rid of threats to superiority.

I know because I've read the glossary (and I forget where else), that the "Tablets of Destinies" are used to track and control the orbits of things. they claim in the book that a destiny cannot be altered, but that seems to be a coverup that they have been altering the orbits of the planets, and just the same as the anatau/anu female ruler, this may have had a repetition in egypt with senmut, moses and hatshepsut, they may have gone about altering the orbits of planets (venus, as velikovski suggests?) and that ended disastrously with the bronze age collapse and the abrupt termination of the 18th dynasty.

the idea here is that history repeats itself much like a "destiny" of a planet (its orbit), but that destiny can be altered, and in the process of altering a planet's destiny, it can lead to disastrous results. so, history repeats itself, so if you were to try and alter the destiny of history, like altering the destiny of a planet leads to disaster, so too does altering the destiny of history lead to disaster.

therefore then, I think the emphasis goes toward "fates" -- which is something that is up to a person to choose, which, btw is an interesting thing because they draw lots to let "fate" decide...

> Let us draw lots! Anu said. By the hand of fate let there be a decision!

a lot of irony here...

---

first of all, the suggestion to try and heal the atmosphere was during the 8th ruler named lahma (which is basically lahmu/mars). they also suggested (and tried) using weapons of terror to get the volcanos to belch out more CO2 as well -- which sounds to me again, like a cover story. why would you use nukes on volcanos? maybe nukes were used, but not on volcanos. I find the name of the ruler to be a strange coincidence.

I think it's quite possible that the technology that alalu used to make tiamat such a successful place eventually got implemented. that technology likely was gold, and while tiamat probably used it to enhance mental capacities, the martians wanted it to save their atmosphere only.

I can't substantiate any of this, but I would imagine that this is likely a repeat of the "tower of babel" where the gold used likely benefitted everyone on the planet. that's not a suitable solution because then everyone gets improved conditions -- and again superiority cannot exist. on tiamat, it was likely created a really flat organisational structure, whereas the annunaki wanted titles, commands, positions, authority, etc. it feels to me that every technology that is ever created (like tesla's world system), it's rejected because it would flatten the structure[^1]. they probably wanted to figure out how to use the technology to fix the atmosphere and make the planet really energetic meanwhile maintaining their ridiculous power structures.

I imagine that they probably did figure out how to use the technology, and prior to when this was written they probably pushed it to it's limits. after whatever happened enlil goes and constructs balbek, which is massive. they were definitely doing things in a big way. well, how big? I don't have a way to say, but some of the mud fossils found have absolutely enormous body parts that have been instantly turned into silica -- which, right before iron, is apparently the last stage of a fusion reaction -- so someone at sometime must have been using the massive amounts of gold laying around to produce environment capable of that much instananeous fusion.

I find it very possible that the martians may have (in the era when nibiru fights tiamat -- the solar regime prior to enki going to earth as the saviour), used that technology to make their planet very very energetic.

imagine for a moment that they were pumping this fusion technology to the max, where silica levels are surpassed and now they're into producing iron in high quantities. the upper atmosphere would be very radiant so it would look like a red star[^2]. it's quite possible that they used pyramids to alter the destiny of "nibiru" so that it takes on a superior orbit.

when reading the cosmogeny of the solar system in the second tablet, I had a strong sense that nibiru has a superiority complex, getting called in to fight against tiamat and put her into her place, and has to have the most elevated and superior orbit.

if mars had the technology to alter its destiny and the technology to turn the planet into a very strongly attracting red star, even though it's little, it could have a massive effect on the solar system. in fact, I think if the planet is going that hard, it wants resources -- badly, and the most plentiful source of neutrons/hydrogen (whatever it is) is the sun and these gas giants. it wouldn't have as much of an effect on the higher density ones like jupiter, but it would have a massive effect on the others if it's attracting that much.

I really get the sense that mars would have been very very attractive having a massive magnetic field and a very strong desire for more hydrogen from anything nearby. this was probably disastrous.

so, yeah, I think mars could have become "nibiru" and then through a series of superiority manouvers, elevated itself to top position in the solar system.

remember, mars is 7th ray emitter, so he's the objective for creating the whole 7th day/ray thing anyway, so if you want to create a bunch of people that are actually superior/successful, but not because of conditions, but instead because of mentality -- you have to start out with unwanted form so you give birth to the wanted aspect.

if mars were nibiru, it fits in perfectly with the way I see this whole thing playing out vibrationally. I can't confirm yet, but I feel it's very very likely because it tells the fate vs destiny thing in the perspective of human history, a person, a planet, or any people group: it's all attraction (there's probably a good reason why mars has such a large gash in its side -- totally not christ symbolism, btw).

---

to explain the vibrational thing, let's first look at the triads: mars is in a triad with vulcan and genxicat. I've given a lot of thought, and I think that genxicat is actually the planetary body of earth. if the thing that caused this whole thing was a corrupted 7th ray male, then the goal is to create a 7th ray female, or ground. since there are no 7th ray grounds, I figure the earth is genxicat. secondly, vulcan (-5+) is labeled like a female (so essentially like a 3rd ray), but with 5th ray output, which is what connects to the 2nd ray "SOLAR ANGEL".

this story has a lot of difficulties with females in power, and I think again that's the same thing of producing the unwanted aspect so that we can give birth to the wanted aspect by *attracting it*, so for mars to essentially be paired with two females is a real problem in the context of gender inequality presented throughout history, started (according to this story) in the very origins of the annunaki firstborn and legal heir stuff.

all of this completely fits with the create wanted by first identifying unwanted in the environment and then naturally desiring the wanted opposite, then finally *attracting* it.

in short, the emitter gets you away from your source -- this is the birth and growing up process, but then after that you begin to return to your source -- which is the "death" process, but really, if you can keep up with it, you don't die. death is just enough of a physical desync from your source, so to stay alive, just stay synchronised with your source by not doing things that desynchronise you from it.

basically, once you reach 7th ray, everything becomes effortless. that's why enki started from the moment he arrived to earth as the "saviour" he decided that the 7th day is a day of rest and effortless creation; a time to enjoy the creation.

[1]: imagine if anyone in the world had access to power. it would greatly advantage the third-world countries and be a huge threat to maintain positions of superiority

[2]: I've often wondered why jehovih calls "earth" the "red star" in so many places. it just occurred to me that this could be a technique that the transmitter of the oahspe information used to not confuse the channel -- to distinguishing between early humans origins on mars and later human origins on earth. I'd have to look at it more closely to look.

### 2022-05-27 04:32 - 7th ray triad

I ended the last entry saying that reaching 7th ray everything becomes effortless. I want to explain myself better. I also mentioned in @[sitchin/thoughts](2022-05-27 04:34) the concept of the progression from a 1-3-7 to a l-2-7 (which is a big difference).

you see, enki is 3rd ray so he specialises in compartmentalisation, which aligns quite well with those sorts of power structures. a 2nd ray sees the big picture but they're so concerned with everyone else, they totally miss the point, because you're not trying to convince anyone else to attract for you. so, because the 2nd ray is so concerned about everyone else, this is why I believe it was ironic that they essentially condemned alalu for being so selfish and not saving them. instead enki, a 3rd ray is designated as the "saviour" being capable of comparmentalising things in a way which is compatible with their power structures.

so really the enki, anu, enlil combo (1-3-7) isn't the saviour because its too compartmentalised. you really need to see the bigger picture to get more saviour-like (2-7, 2-3), but that's still not good enough because if you're looking at only the parts or only at the whole, you miss the "fates" aspect to it all (desire). so, really to get the complete creation (the 7-headed dragon), you need a 1-2-3 or a 1-2-7 approach.

to accomplish this, they put mars (+7) in with vulcan (-5+) which emits and receives 2nd ray energy transmitted into the top sublayer of the 5th ray[^1]

then, I noted that they had another hidden triad when they talked about jeortau and anatau are twins, allayandra was created along with those two and have interconnected minds -- ie 1-2-7 combo seems to be the goal. they mention elsewhere that if mars is working in the same energy domain as anatau, he becomes like a 1st ray male, able to emit bursts of 1st ray energy. as a 7th ray male he already receives 1st ray energy, so to become a "ground", he just needs to be able to receive 7th ray energy. well, like I said, he's also paired with genxicat (-7), so that's exactly what she does.

so, if there's a 7th ray receiver, then there's a 7th ray emitter. that's thoth, and he's paired with venus, which is a (-3), but that's basically what vulcan is (receiver of 3rd and emitter of 5th because he's male, but also receiver of 5th because his ground positon)...

---

enough of that. what I'm trying to say is that mars, in the presence of anatau, if he can actually work in a 5th ray energy domain he becomes much more likely to actually be the saviour -- which is sorta weird. mars, in the case of being with anatau becomes a 1st ray, which a 1st ray is more similar to a 3rd ray in the technological aspect -- but, like I said, a 2nd ray perspective of everyone affecting everyone else doesn't really help. you have to be selfish (1st ray desire/fate) to attract what you want, but you have to also see the big picture to do it, because you're attracting what you feel (5th ray) and concepts that feel similar (2nd ray), so it's hard to sort that out really. the sirians say...

> The SECOND RAY has within its equipment the active intelligence of the THIRD RAY. The FIRST RAY has within its equipment the quality of love and active intelligence, all of which is powered by the relentless pursuit of purpose. This means that the FIRST RAY has all the assets and liabilities of the other two. The quest of mental pursuits is strong within them; so is the desire of and for love but the THIRD RAY attribute harmonizes with the FIRST RAY better and is more useful in the pursuit of the purpose so the FIRST RAY hides and even tries to deny all of the SECOND RAY qualities. Of course, this does not work and creates conflict within.

I dislike the word "love" -- so, what all of that means is that the 1st ray will look to material things/manifestations to fulfil that desire/purpose, and totally neglect that it's not the things -- the parts that make up the whole, but how everything feels as a whole (ie. what you're tuned to).

and so, the idea that what you desire is a fate that you can get a different result than the predicted one by tuning to it. you don't have to endure the unalterable destiny that something is on. the destiny is the physical trajectory (which reflects the conceptual trajectory).

the fate is the conceptual/emotional trajectory.

---

I'm really struggling to put all of this into words, but it totally all makes sense to me now. I'll keep hacking away at it, trying to explain it from more and more perspectives.

mr. motor is very very upset right now. I think he's channeling enlil our saviour.

[1]: according to the sirians, anyway -- and I think they're right, because the way things "connect" is the way they feel -- and all concepts are constantly attracting more things and affecting other concepts based on the way they feel

### 2022-05-29 13:19 - helplessness

last night I finished up the 9th tablet and then I lisnend to snake-bros "#045 - into nowhere", and the sense that the author presented was one of helplessness. interestingly it's the same feeling that I feel between the annunaki and the deluge and today's world leaders and the 411 stuff: @[blahblog](2022-05-29 13:33). I think it's a combination of coverup and helplessness.

as I'm reading the tablet, I noticed that the first thing they did is keep the coming deluge a secret from people. the second thing I noticed is that they already had a series of things to blame. they said that sunspots were getting really big and dark (if you can see a dark spot on the sun, the sun's surface has an ENORMOUS vortex/sunspot on it), and they also said there were an accelerating number of earthquakes, it stopped raining, and the coming deluge is going to be caused by a glacier falling into the ocean. so, glacier was the CO2 of those times, huh? it's the same BS as modern science: they're identifying a problem and then rapidly jumping to blame all of these "climate extremes" on something may sound kinda maybe plausible, maybe.

---

it's pretty obvious to me that the annunaki have no idea what's causing the disturbances in the climate. I think this story is a retroperspective on the whole thing as dictated to the scribe, probably by enki himself, and essentially the conclusion there is analysing the difference between fate and destiny. enki doesn't say it specifically, but if we consider that alalu did have a successful thing going and likely enlil got pissed off and tried to destroy a creation that alalu made. well enki repeated the same performance on earth and he's kinda saying that history repeated itself.

so how repeatable is history? he questioned. (lol) cause I think this is the first serious inquiry into what is attraction. enki seems to be starting to see that there is some other factor at work, and it isn't just physical conditions that are to blame for the catastrophes.

I want to finish the book before I begin to talk seriously about it, but a destiny inspires a feeling of helplessness -- but he notices that you can alter a destiny in the sense of altering the orbit of the planet, but if I'm right, this is what they originally did to mars, and the large gash in the side is evidence that even with altering the physical trajectory, there's still another force at work here (which I believe is what caused the attraction to mars/nibiru) -- but he sees that even though there is a trajectory of a person, that trajectory isn't certain -- which is what he calls a "fate" -- and that alteration of trajectory *doesn't* seem to cause worse effects (like the alteration of a destiny does).

so what is the mechanism that allows for the alteration of a fate? he seems to be tying in the dissatisfaction, but there's a subconflict which is identified by the word "satiated" -- where he keeps trying to satiate the dissatisfied annunaki and igigi, but it's to no avail. no matter how hard he tries, they're always pissed off and unhappy. what that tells me is he notices that dissatisfaction causes massive destructions and the planet to stop nurturing its inhabitants, but he can't figure out how to get others to stop being dissatisfied about stuff.

it's a really interesting book because of all of the dynamics, and I kinda think that the conclusion to it has a much stronger emphasis on secrecy and illusions -- because I'm now reading the book with the assumption that the nibiru thing is just a story to continue to allow them to look like gods with a heavanly abode, when they're just as helpless as anyone else. if nibiru is a made-up story and they're just keeping up the charade because it legitamises their rulership, and without it, they're no different than the earthlings. enlil is very scared that the earthlings will "become like us" -- but more than that, he's scared that they'll become better than them (the very thing that I think he's scared of and has tried to get rid of since alalu). without nibiru, what makes them any more fit to rule than an earthling?

if humans were to find a way to organise theirselves without the top-down rulership, that would be the ultimate disaster. there's no way to really remove their power structures without attracting our own problems. there's also no way to get them to stop being dissatisfied about everything; that's entirely their decision.

at the end of this next cycle, I think that it's going to be global 411. when it happens, only the astral an the conceptual will remain, because physical will cease to have suitable support for human life in the traditional sense, and so will be "rebuilt" as a manifestation of our perception (I've considered this to be the most likely way that all of our attraction will begin to form into larger and larger structurs)

until then, a feeling of helplessness will continue to grow, I'm sure. from their perspective, they'll be overrun by beings that are pretty similar to me.

it's really cool man because this 411 stuff sounds really crazy and stuff, but it's just the next cataclysm. they have no idea how to prevent it, and this time only you can only save yourself (ie if you're outside of time and space, you're fine).

sure self-organising humans is a pretty big disaster, but an accelerating number of leapfrogging-time-pickles is an even *bigger* disaster. I'm really excited to learn more. this book is really really inspiring.
