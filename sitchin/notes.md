### right hand of the father

I noticed in the judging of alalu, enki is seated at the right of anu (the father), and enlil on the left.

well, it's interesting considering the connection that I made between alalu and jeortau with the dove symbolism, because later on in the bible jesus says (mat 26:64)

> hereafter, ye shall see the son of man seated at the right hand of power [father?] and coming in the clouds

not the verse I was looking for. there's another in rom 8:33-34 that's intreresting. I'm not finding what I'm looking for so I'll just explain it:

first of all, I think that alalu went and made a successful colony of humans that were superior to the annunaki, and so alalu got murdered and destroyed with the weapons of terror that they're so against using. that's why this story, if you read it with this lens is all about the "vengenance" of alalu for getting his planet blown up with weapons of terror. this is a cover story to hide a number of things.

I think anu was already a girl, and so his biting off his malehood was just a cover story[^2] to explain away an assertive woman in power before a culture could accept it[^1].

it's quite possible that enlil has a heavy hand in this story because the end of the has him and enki all super buddy-buddy and wondering if history will repeat itself.

so, in this judgment scene, they go to great lengths to judge alalu and condemn him (in this story) for (I believe) making a superior race of beings and planetary environment (compared to nibiru which is failing). basically, they're pissed that he isn't saving their atmosphere problem, and instead peaced out to make his own setup on another planet. if there are three habitable planets[^5], mars/nibiru, zyron/tiamat, and earth -- and alalu goes and makes a superior setup on tiamat instead of saving nibiru, he's essentially, *not* their saviour, and mars needs saving, so they destroy tiamat and alalu. the only planet remaining now is earth[^4] cause tiamat is gone and mars is in bad shape, so the annunaki saviour position goes to enki and the earth.

I find further evidence of this is the ridiculous claims that alalu wanted to become the king of nibiru if he was going to save the planet. I think that's exactly the opposite of what I think happened -- which is that he peaced out of the mars/nibiru disaster and took off for zyron to do his own thing. he was probably very successful and so to watch someone else peace out of your situation and to thrive probably pissed them off further -- which then I believe they (probably enlil) felt they had no choice to use weapons of terror to destroy tiamat, so he gets judged and condemned for being successful instead of saving them. they need to condemn alalu's selfish behaviour.

so then, in the bible when jesus is constantly presented at the one that is seated at the right hand of the father feels to me like a symbolic thing where he's equated with enki here.

I believe that the reception of the dove after his baptism was the reception of this jeortau energy. so, to explain that, a 2nd ray has all of the qualities of a 3rd ray, but when a third ray (enki) approaches it from that perspective, the 3rd ray sees parts and pieces, and the 2nd ray sees the whole, and that we're all connected and each of our actions influence the other, so the scene there is kinda like enlil (who is clearly 7th ray), anu (1st), and enki (3rd) are judging a 2nd ray for being selfish.

this is something like a the part of an organisation that's failing, condeming another organisation for being successful.

it's hard to describe the concept that I received from this because let's just assume that enlil is a 7th ray -- so basically allayandra/mars -- well, jesus is basically enlil+anu (allayandra+anatau) combined with jeortau/alalu (ater the baptism). it's the progression from a 1-3-7 to a l-2-7, which is a big difference.

[1]: seems this is a repeating occurance of dressing a woman up as a dude to allow her to have power. it feels very similar to hatshepsut and senmut, then again with akhenaten and nefertiti.

[2]: it has all of the classic elements that assure you of its validity, because they wrestle naked, so in the mental image conveyed in the mind[^3] anu is a man and you combine it with the grotesque image of someone losing and getting poisoned by such a potent king's malehood. the graphic image impresses the mind and makes it more real. this is hollywood presentation of a narrative but for ancients.

[3]: I think their language conjures images in the mind of the symbols presented -- cause that's what it does for me even reading the english translation of it. once I get into the mindset of the writer, the story is very visual for me.

[4]: this cover story narrative I'm painting here totally changes the flooding event narrative, because the big problem for enlil is that earth is the only option remaining and it feels to me like he doesn't want to lose that only option  remaining (earth), but on the other side, he also feels no other option than to destroy the humans cause they threaten his only option (earth). so he is forced to decide between two "only options" (which I think is kinda funny because he doesn't have any options because its all attraction).

### conflict foreboding

A conflict that the obtainment of gold would endanger Anu was fearing; One of the brothers to Nibiru must return

so they cast lots...

Anu to Nibiru to return, its ruler on the throne to remain

### words

I get the sense that the word translated as "rocket" can probably be translated as "anti-gravity".

"sky chamber" seems to be also an anti-gravity device -- something today we would associate with a UFO or flying saucer. it has the ability to scan, move around the planet, survey, and oversee things.
