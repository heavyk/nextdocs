A conflict that the obtainment of gold would endanger Anu was fearing; One of the brothers to Nibiru must return

### words

I get the sense that the word translated as "rocket" can probably be translated as "anti-gravity".

"sky chamber" seems to be also an anti-gravity device -- something today we would associate with a UFO or flying saucer. it has the ability to scan, move around the planet, survey, and oversee things.
