### inconsistencies

> Ea his bride-to-be by Anu's decree abandoned, a princess named Damkina he instead espoused; A son, an heir, to them was born; Marduk they named him, One in a Pure Pace Born it meant.

> Imperishable Star: The Egyptian name for the planet from which Ra had come to Earth 

I don't know where sitchin got this from but the sirians say that ra and venus are made from the same silica stuff. what I don't understand is how enki bore a son with damkina that had a different appearance than he did. I get the feeling that these sons and daughters narratives are sorta like a coverup.

### time problems

> On Lahmu construction was progressing; heroes for the Way Station were also arriving.
> A Shar, two Shars were the preparations lasting; then Anu gave the word.
> On Earth the seventh day it was, a day of resting by Enki at the beginning decreed.

how did two shars (7200y) pass in a single day on earth?

---

> Males with females among them were constantly mating, quick were their proliferations:
> In one Shar, sometimes four, sometimes more, were their generations!

it took them 3600y to make 4+ generations? that seems improbable to me. even the biblical patriarchs reproduced faster than this.

---

> One day of Nibiru was a month of Earth for her, Two days, three days, four days of Nibiru like months of Earth they were, Five and six and seven and eight days of months were completed; The ninth count of motherhood was completed; Ninmah was in travail.

> Fast was the newborn growing, what on Nibiru a day was, a month in the Abzu was.

> The pregnancy, by an admixture conceived, how long will it last? to each other they wondered.
> Will it be nine months of Nibiru, will it be nine months of Earth?

if 1 nibiru day is 30 earth days, that means that the average pregnancy on nibiru would last 8100 earth days... that would be very unfortunate to be pregnant 22.5y. wow. time must go very very fast there -- so it was probably very high frequency existance there.

---

> In the ninety-third Shar the two, by Enki fathered, in the Edin were born.
> In the ninety-fifth Shar, a son Adapa and Titi finally had; Sati, He Who Life Binds Again, Titi him named; by him were the generations of Adapa counted.
> In the ninety-seventh Shar, to Sati a son by his spouse Azura was born.

that means that it took adapa and titi (adam and eve) 7200y to conceive seth after cain and abel. that's a long time. then, 7200y later seth gives birth.

I get the feeling that the shar isn't 3600 *earth* years... I'm starting to get the sense that it may actually be a solar cycle, but I'm not sure. I would say that going by genesis numbers, the shar may be 36-72y -- I dunno.

> In the midst of the ninety-third Shar was he born, by the end of the one hundred and eighth he died.

he lived ~14.5 shars. if a shar is 64y, he lived 928y. 

### alalu and the adamu

I noticed that enki called the primitive worker "lulu" -- which is like "alalu" -- when successful creating the first female, she is called "ti-amat" -- which is very similar to tiamat.

I wonder if the first set of beings that were created was actually done prior to this by alalu on tiamat -- but alalu's beings weren't primitive workers, but instead geniuses.

he then took alalu's recipe and combined it with the ape to get the adamu.

I wonder if alalu's recipe first came from pigs?

### ninmah and anu

I keep noticing that anu has a lot of decisions that ninmah seems to be the one that relays the information. if nibiru is just a ficticious planet, the ruler of nibiru could also be ficticious as well. inotherwords, anu could be completely made up. ninmah is anu, but because everything is run by dudes, she could be just giving the words of anu (from nibiru which nobody in sumer has ever seen), running the show from earth.

### the waystation on mars

there's this weird thing where anu gives the word (which ninmah relays) that mars needs to become the waystation before sending the gold to nibiru. from the perspective of the people on earth, they're sending the gold to nibiru, but it has to go to mars (which is nibiru).

### planets to the annunaki

he calls the gas giants, "firm planets", saying that jupiter is the foremost, which is the opposite of mainstream *gas* giants, so why would he call gas "firm"?

### conflict foreboding

A conflict that the obtainment of gold would endanger Anu was fearing; One of the brothers to Nibiru must return

so they cast lots...

Anu to Nibiru to return, its ruler on the throne to remain

### destiny and fate

> So did Enlil in anger say. Now the lot is cast, destiny by fate is overtaken!


### the winds

nibiru has various "winds" that sitchtin identifies as moons of nibiru (which I think came originally from tiamat). enlil says they have a sacred mission to the winds in context to the igigi taking human females as wives.

> One evil deed by another has been followed, fornication from Enki and Marduk the Igigi have adopted, *Our pride and sacred mission to the winds have been abandoned*, By our own hands this planet with Earthling multitudes shall be overrun!

were the winds some sort of agreement that they made to maintain a genetic separation between the race of super beings that alalu made on tiamat?

### tiamat as a small solar system

tiamat supposedly had 11 moons, the foremost was kingu. this is a mirror of the solar system. the sun is a second ray, and jeortau/alalu also is a second ray. I believe his planetary identity was tiamat. so, just like the sun has 11 moons around it, so too would tiamat have 11 moons around it. he was trying to make a companion solar system or a copy or something.

if kingu was the foremost, I wonder if that would correspond with the largest planet in our solar system, jupiter -- meaning that tiamat would be (proportionally) to the sun as our moon is to jupiter. it's kind of an interesting idea.

### zodiac and the planetary gods

> Of the family of the Sun and the twelve celestial gods Enki him was teaching, And how the months by the Moon were counted and the years by the Sun, And how by Nibiru the Shars were counted, and how the counts by Enki were combined, How the lord Enki *the circle of the heavens to twelve parts divided, A constellation to each one how Enki assigned, twelve stations in a grand circle he arranged, How to honor the twelve Anunnaki great leaders by names the stations were called.*

- archer: ninurta
- scorpion:
- scales: venus?
- virgin: innana
- lion: osiris?
- crab: venus?
- twins: utu/shamash
- bull: enlil
- ram: ra
- fish: ninmah?
- aquaman: enki/sanatau
- seagoat: dumuzi?/saturn?

the male gods are:

> So did *Marduk*, as Ra, above all other gods himself emplace, Their powers and attributes to himself he by himself assigned; As *Enlil* I am for lordship and decrees, as *Ninurta* for the hoe and combat; As *Adad* for lightning and thunder, as *Nannar* for illuminating the night; As *Utu* I am Shamash, as *Nergal* over the Lower World I reign; As *Gibil* the golden depths I know, whence copper and silver come I have found; As *Ningishzidda* numbers and their count I command, the heavens my glory bespeak!

- ra/marduk
  - jeortau: utu (and enlil?)
  - sanatau: (not userped?)
  - ra: adad
  - osiris: nannar?
  - thoth: ningishzidda
  - saturn: nergal
  - mars: ninurta
  - vulcan: gibil

I'm actually kinda confused because supposedly innana and utu are twins. likewise anatau and jeortau are twins. so if utu is jeortau, that just leaves enlil -- so is sanatau enlil? that's not possible because ptah is enki. he seems to not try and userp enki then I guess.

### ME and codes

ME sounds to me like genetic code -- DNA. they seemed to have the ability to understand the formulas of the genetic code built into their own genetic code, and so they used genetic code (DNA) as a sort of computer capable of calculating orbits and recording data.

what's interesting to me is they seem to interface with the genetic code directly -- seemingly by looking at it or touching it, and so the secrets stored on the ME needed to be stored in a safe place.

another interesting thing is, assuming that ME is DNA, they don't seem to need to preserve it in any way -- and it's almost as if it won't degrade or deteriorate, which suggests to me that another basic knowledge they had is to create an environment where DNA doesn't seem to degrade.

though they seemingly live very long lifespans, they do seem to die, and so therefore something is degrading the DNA associated with daily living, rather than an environmental degredation. if they were so knowledgeable of creating such a preservative environment, this may be the original reason for introducing telomeres as a sort of "programmed obsolesence"

later on when the environment got worse, their size (they were giants apparently) decreased and they lived shorter lifespans. this may have also degraded the MEs that they stored their data and secrets on, too, which is why they had to seemingly start over after the major cataclysms.

### deluge

> On that day, on that unforgettable day, the Deluge with a roar began; In the Whiteland, at the Earth's bottom, the Earth's foundations were shaking; Then with a roar to a thousand thunders equal, off its foundations the icesheet slipped, By Nibiru's unseen netforce it was pulled away, into the south sea crashing.

they blame a glacier slipping, and that may have happened, but it has to do with the sun for sure because a glacier doesn't cause earthquakes, water to dry up, abnormal netforces (gravity) and other effects like that. the glacier is just a cover story.

it mentions that when the deluge starts, the whitelands (antartica) as having received the majority of the impact. I find this interesting because I personally subscribe to the idea of the chestahedron being a part of the structure of the earth, with the triangle at the north pole and the tip at the south pole (antartica). I don't think the pole really shifts, so I find it pretty likely that most of the monuments are oriented to the cardinal directions *because* of the vortex emitted by the chestahedron. inotherwords, if it were off from the cardinal directions, the structure wouldn't receive all of the energy from the earth's vortex (cause it would be slightly misaligned).

anyway, frank shows how solar wind enters in a ring around the north pole, circles down to the tip on the bottom (south pole) reverses direction, just like the fibers around the human heart and then comes back up and out the north pole again. this explains the difference in aurora on the north vs south poles, because when the energy coming in has to reverse directions, not all of it reverses, so it creates that outward flow on the bottom seen as auroras (within the arctic circle, I believe). the outward flow on the north pole is outside of the top circle (arctic circle?) and so that's why auroras can be seen in the northern hemisphere down into michigan and lower latitudes.

so if the sun put out a HUGE CME, the earth would send most of that energy down to the south pole. just saying, it looks like the sun is what's causing this "deluge" to me and the glacier is just a secondary effect.

if you imagine the north and south poles as the sacral and the pineal, the earth getting hit by a massive CME is sorta the equivalent to the earth's kundalini rising. the south (sacral) will vibrate just the same as the north (pineal).

> A storm, its ferocity never before seen, *at the Earth's bottom* began to howl, Its winds the wall of water were driving, the tidal wave northward was spreading; Northward was the wall of waters onrushing, the Abzu lands it was reaching.

so again, this tidal wave is blamed on the "glacier" but I think that this massive tidal wave was likely caused by an induced vibration in the south pole.

---

wow, that got quite a few reactions... now I'm thinking about something I saw a long time ago on Suspicious0bservers, which was that he claimed that the earth rotates 90(degrees) in one of these events. the thing is there is evidence of a massive amount of water etching canyons into the east-west directions, on the coasts of the americas and also africa, as it looks like lots of water flowed down into the ocean (when the ocean was obviously much lower), so I dunno how this would work cause I can't really visualise it, but maybe... what if the north pole was somewhere else than it is now, and maybe the south pole somewhere in the atlanic? and so that's why atlantis sank? one thing that always wondered to me was why in zailm's story, is there so much ice on the mountains in atlantis? that part never made sense to me because it seemed like it was also quite temperate.

anyway, the reason why I bring that up is because the ancient monuments being oriented to the cardinal directions means that the earth prior to the last cataclysm can only one of four ways (same, upside down, 90 left, 90 right) for them to retain their alignment.

so what I'm saying is, could "the whitelands" be atlantis, which was also our previous south pole? it explains the massive amount of water erosion on the west coast of africa and the east coast of the USA... just a thought... I have no idea. I just thought this was an interesting idea. this book is clearly describing a massive amount of energy being injected into the south pole, wherever that was.

I guess one way to test the theory: is to see if nippur <-> mt. moriah would be a suitable change considered as the location of the "naval" of the earth.

### dumuzi's death

I suspect something is seriously mistelling with the story of innana and dumuzi. first, enki, hearing about his death does a monologue about water being the culprit for so many misfortunes, though its his namesake -- so he fashions two robots out of clay and sends them to fetch *innana* (not dumuzi).

when arriving, the robots find innana dead...

> Upon the corpse the clay emissaries a Pulser and an Emitter directed, Then the Water of Life on her they sprinkled, in her mouth the Plant of Life they placed.
> Then Inanna stirred, her eyes she opened; from the dead Inanna arose.
> When the two emissaries Inanna to the Upper World were ready to return, Inanna the lifeless body of Dumuzi to take along them ordered.

why did they only raise innana and not dumuzi? doesn't make sense...
also, why did enki detcide to build clay robots to get innana, but not dumuzi (his son)? also doesn't make sense...

also, innana and ninmah seem to be very similar, and it wonders to me also why ninmah dissappears from the story at the end of tablet 10. she's renamed to ninharsag (see next section).

additionally, there's that weird incident when "anu" tells dumuzi to stay on nibiru for the next year with her/him. of that, I was reminded of the story of joseph and "potiphar's wife" (senmut and hatshepsut).

there's another weird incident too where the dumuzi incident is related right after the asar incident, but in this incident, innana doesn't want to impregnate herself like asta did -- though, right after horon was born he fights satu right over ninharsag's place (is this where mecca is located?). seems she has ningshzidda build horon a metal something to defeat him -- but that was looked down upon -- so is that why she got lableled "peacemaker"?

anyway, after doing an elaborate burial for dumizi, she goes to enki to start a war (against his other son marduk)

> As for herself, to the abode of Enki Inanna set her steps, Retribution for her beloved's death she wanted, the death of Marduk the culprit she demanded.

### ninharsag and innana

> When Ninharsag for peace the disputing clans together brought, Inanna and Dumuzi away from the others to be together managed, love to each other they professed.

ever since ninmah is renamed to ninharsag at the end of tablet 10, she's called "the peacemaker" -- yet, innana is always causing wars now. I get the feeling there's a reason why her named got changed.

### galzu the mystery emmisary and how the annunaki kings became our babysitters

he appears in a dream to enki telling him to save humankind. he also tells them they can't return to nibiru (is this a cover story because nibiru is mars?), and so he sorta redirects the trajectory through time, essentially establishing enki, ninmah, and enlil as the guardians of earth and the humans, kinda getting them stuck to the planet.

so, to remain lofty as gods (though remaining on earth), they say they'll divide up the land into regions and descend the kingship down from nibiru (of course they're the ones running the show).

so, if I assume that nibiru is ficticious, anu and antu are just ninmah, then it's almost as if galzu is a perfect cover to set them up as divine emmisaries:

> The will of the Creator of All is clear to see: On Earth and for Earthlings, only emissaries we are The Earth to the Earthlings belongs, to preserve and advance them we were intended!

obviously then...

> To create civilized regions the Great Anunnaki decided, therein knowledge to Mankind provide; Cities of Man to establish, therein in sacred precincts abodes for the Anunnaki create; Kingship as on Nibiru on Earth establish, crown and scepter to a chosen man give; By him the word of the Anunnaki to the people convey, work and dexterity to enforce; In the sacred precincts a priesthood to establish, the Anunnaki as lofty lords to serve and worship.

### where is japheth?

### words

I get the sense that the word translated as "rocket" can probably be translated as "anti-gravity".

"sky chamber" seems to be also an anti-gravity device -- something today we would associate with a UFO or flying saucer. it has the ability to scan, move around the planet, survey, and oversee things.

netforce is a planet's attraction (gravity)
"Allani" is an epithet of Ereshkigal. it feel related to alalu.


Mummu: The planet we call Mercury.
Japhet: The third son of the hero of the Deluge.
Place of the Celestial Chariots: Sinai region directly in front of the sphinx, Tilmun. Another is located near to Bad-Tibera.


### incredible quotes I want to memorise

> With wisdom and understanding has the Creator of All our life essence filled, To whatever using of it we capable are, is it not that for which we have been destined?
