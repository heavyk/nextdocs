I decided I'd write down my internal dialoge regarding the song. easier to write than to speak.

#### WALK IN DARKNESS - No Oxygen In The West

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/9kuvyiRQjow?list=TLPQMTEwMzIwMjOM9YlUE0vHlQ)

    In silence
    The light gives way to madness
    We run looking for something
    Stomping everything we meet
    Now time is running out

time lasts for as long as you need to "pass the level". I know this sounds hard to believe because we've been taught to believe in a monotomic timeline, where each moment is preceded by another and proceded by a different one -- which is true in the micro level -- but *you* (a conscious being), continue to live in the same "zone" of time: consider it like a level, but not a discrete unit of obfectives or things to learn -- instead, as a spectrum of desire (cause you keep adding more) -- and when you've fulfilled (realised/understood) your desire, you move on to the next "level". we appear now in this "zone" of time, because our desire is to begin to know more of ourselves than *just* this human body, and so we find ourselves "now" -- and you'll keep finding me and everyone in this level leading up to the present *now* and all subsequent *nows* until we've fulfilled our desire to know ourselves in that new way.

it's like a "level" in the sense that every time that you "die" you repeat the same level over and over until you figure out how to satisfy your desire. it appears lke everyone else is sharing a *now* with you, but it's all "time" is a reflection of your concept of how to fulfill that desire. you can't run out of time.

    Our hands can take anything but our souls remain empty
    There's no more oxygen in the West
    There's no more oxygen
    If we scream or cry words get lost in the sky
    Like wind and dust, like clouds passing by
    We drag ourselves like ghosts

focusing on conditions. not your problem and doesn't limit you from realising/understanding your desire as a reflection of who you *really* are.

    Looking back from time to time
    Waiting for this day to pass in vain
    Hoping, hoping, tomorrow to be born again

depressing. you're born again every single moment, just like a pixel gets redrawn every moment. sure it looks like hope is the only thing one can do, when depressed like that, but when you see yourself reflected in every aspect of your reality, you won't want to look back anymore, and you don't need anything to pass. eternally unfolding rapture of the present moment, is what it feels like :)

    Like a heron in flight
    Beyond the stars and even further away
    Like a drop of light exploded from a new day
    Like a heron in flight
    On the oceans, beyond the oceans
    In distant skies
    Beyond the horizon line

beutiful imagery :)

    Love is not required any more
    Babylon lifts her legs
    And she smiles
    And gives everyone the same destiny
    We've lost the kinship to the Gods
    In algorithms and Technoreligions

there's *always* gonna be *some guy*
that thinks he's got it all figured out...
lol

    The candle of reason fades away
    No remission, no empathy or compassion
    The light bends to insanity
    And the path is lost in the maze of lies
    There's no more oxygen in the West
    No more oxygen in the West.
    To be born again
    Like a heron in flight
    Beyond the stars and even further away
    Like a drop of light exploded from a new day
    Like a heron in flight
    On the oceans, beyond the oceans
    In distant skies
    Beyond the horizon line
    Like a heron in flight
    Beyond the stars and even further away
    Like a drop of light exploded from  a new day
    Like a heron in flight
    On the oceans, beyond the oceans
    There's no more oxygen in the West

get gud lungs, bro...
