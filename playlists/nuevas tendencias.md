### 2023-03-11 18:39 - thoughts on some songs

I decided I'd write down my internal dialoge regarding the song. easier to write than to speak.

#### WALK IN DARKNESS - No Oxygen In The West

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/9kuvyiRQjow?list=TLPQMTEwMzIwMjOM9YlUE0vHlQ)

    In silence
    The light gives way to madness
    We run looking for something
    Stomping everything we meet
    Now time is running out

time lasts for as long as you need to "pass the level". I know this sounds hard to believe because we've been taught to believe in a monotomic timeline, where each moment is preceded by another and proceded by a different one -- which is true in the micro level -- but *you* (a conscious being), continue to live in the same "zone" of time for as long as you're attracted to it: consider it like a novel/level, but not a discrete set of objectives or things to learn -- instead, as a spectrum of desire (cause you keep adding more) -- and when you've fulfilled (realised/understood) your desire, you move on to the next "level".

we appear now in this "zone" of time, because our desire is to begin to know more of ourselves than *just* this human body, and so we find ourselves "now" -- and you'll keep finding me and everyone in this level leading up to the present *now* and all subsequent *nows* until we've fulfilled our desire to know ourselves in that new way.

it's like a "level" in the sense that every time that you "die" you repeat the same level over and over until you figure out how to satisfy your desire. it appears lke everyone else is sharing a *now* with you, but it's all "time" is a reflection of your concept of how to fulfill that desire so think of everyone else as a sort of "cameo" in your story. you can't run out of time, cause you're sorta gonna be wherever you are until the "end of time".

    Our hands can take anything but our souls remain empty
    There's no more oxygen in the West
    There's no more oxygen
    If we scream or cry words get lost in the sky
    Like wind and dust, like clouds passing by
    We drag ourselves like ghosts

focusing on conditions. not your problem and doesn't limit you from realising/understanding your desire as a reflection of who you *really* are.

    Looking back from time to time
    Waiting for this day to pass in vain
    Hoping, hoping, tomorrow to be born again

depressing. just like every pixel gets redrawn every frame, so too are you reborn again every single moment. sure it looks like hope is the only thing one can do to become a different pixel, and that seems like the most optimistic way too look at from a feeling of depression, but when you see yourself reflected back to you in every aspect of your reality, you won't want to look back anymore, and you don't need anything to pass cause are *not*, not *then*. eternally unfolding rapture of the present moment, is what it feels like :)

    Like a heron in flight
    Beyond the stars and even further away
    Like a drop of light exploded from a new day
    Like a heron in flight
    On the oceans, beyond the oceans
    In distant skies
    Beyond the horizon line

beutiful imagery :)

    Love is not required any more
    Babylon lifts her legs
    And she smiles
    And gives everyone the same destiny
    We've lost the kinship to the Gods
    In algorithms and Technoreligions

there's *always* gonna be *some guy*
that thinks he's got it all figured out...
lol

    The candle of reason fades away
    No remission, no empathy or compassion
    The light bends to insanity
    And the path is lost in the maze of lies
    There's no more oxygen in the West
    No more oxygen in the West.
    To be born again
    Like a heron in flight
    Beyond the stars and even further away
    Like a drop of light exploded from a new day
    Like a heron in flight
    On the oceans, beyond the oceans
    In distant skies
    Beyond the horizon line
    Like a heron in flight
    Beyond the stars and even further away
    Like a drop of light exploded from  a new day
    Like a heron in flight
    On the oceans, beyond the oceans
    There's no more oxygen in the West

get gud lungs, bro...

as I was listening to this song, I was thinking about the last song, "walk like heros", at the end of the song, I was lamenting that it says "if I walk among the stars", yet the description of the stars' perception is not at all star-like.

I mentioned the "time zones" idea before and I wanted to expand on it from a star's perspective, which is that the creation exists in let's say 1000 time zones, and then those time zones create new zones, but each of those zones exist at the same time. there are many more than 1000. inside of the star, there are super concepts, which is like the "soul" or the thing whos desire is a frequency of a time zone -- but the soul or super concept isn't yet at that frequency.

each of the souls' interaction inside of each zone produces a spherical vibration, and so when more souls are interacting in zones of compatible/harmonious frequencies, then they amplify each other (excitement). so, the more souls there are in similar time zones vibrating at a similar frequency, the more excitement she feels.

therefore, because all of the "loneliness" and "misery" states that she sees, *do* exist, but they exist simultaneous to the pleasure, joy, and extasy states as well. all the zones exist, and its only the souls which are deciding where to tune into.

nothing is going wrong :) creation takes time...

#### 2023-03-15 02:32 - consciousness units

the frequency of the universe is so impossibly high, it's essentially impossible for us to perceive it. think about how dense the sun is, and what kind of frequency hydrogen compressed to that density would be resonant with, and that's a much lower octave of the universe's frequency -- therefore, for that to become useful, the frequency needs to be slowed down by dividing it into smaller parts -- these become let's say "consciousness units" the stuff that the universe is actively engaged in perceiving itself, which itself is also like a star.

those consciousness units get converted into rocks, plants, bugs, and humans and all kinds of physical matter. along the way the division of this consciousness gets divided into smaller units based on a symbolic system of perception, just like we do to divide all of the input signals we receive into smaller (more comprehendable) forms. these forms are divided by perception and turn into perception, so you can see the infinitely expanding feedback loop.

it's like when you put the mic in front of the amp -- but instead of letting the volume go off toward infinity so it screeches, instead you transform and divide the escallating amplitude into smaller and smaller (higher and higher frequency) signals, when then you gradually come to make symbolic sense of, so that at first it sounds like a screech if you leave it for 10s -- but with a system of perception, one could perceive the previous 10s all at the same time by only hearing the "now" screech and dividing it into comprehensible units. those units become what we call "reality".

### 2023-03-15 03:13 - HammerFall - Always Will Be

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/VlISKnb-LfY)

as you were singing in that song, I had a strange realisation -- cause I just talked about the venusian system of creating reality, which is much more narrative in nature.. so then, when I'm listening to the song, it sounds to me like that -- like this narrative form of attraction where one narrates how the things arrive to you. I discovered this form of perception when I starting thinking about the outside-in perception talking to nikki.

so I guess I have a few questions -- but I don't know yet how to form them into words, so it might take me a bit...

how do you perceive desire? is it a set of attributes that are determined that are functionally superior?

what do you do about the unknown? is it exciting? or is high value something that resonates with something else? like for me, the idea of discovering something new is so intoxicating that I just have a firehose of ideas flowing through my head all the time because the more I make sense of them, the more pleasure I feel. I get that too. I write so much because it's so pleasureable to me to figure things out.

what do you do when you're wrong or perceived something incorrectly? is it the end of the world? does reality feel like it's unstable and ready to crumble and so I have to find a way to feel right about my reality? that's kinda what happens to me.

concepts are forever; even the bad/dysfunctional/not-optimal ones. so just cause it's been around for a while (and therefore resonates with a lot of things), I've come to dislike with time actually. I've fully embraced the "world of change", knowing that my system is always outdated, as fast as I manifest that idea into reality, there's always a newer more improved version. I now really enjoy the constant discovery of the new interpretation of the symbol or concept to be more what I want it to be. this has fulfilled the insatiable desire inside of me to figure things out. it's fun seeing something new all the time. life is like that short inhale right before a huge moment of discovery, pleasure, trepidation or fear; so, it feels like, without a system of understanding, what that brief pause of rapture really feels like, life could instantly turn to dread and dispair -- but it doesn't -- so it's fun :)
