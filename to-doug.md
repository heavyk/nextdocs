you mention the ecplipse of 2046. I looked it up (https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2046-august-2) and couldn't find a similar path to the one you showed there. did the moon move since you took that screenshot?

interestingly enough I [there used to be more written here. I have no idea where the rest of the sentence went. I remember doing a search on the eclipse pattern that he showed in the video there and found some interesting results. I can't remember what they were now, though. since it's the moon and the US govt is very interested in the moon, I probably said something taboo and possibly it got deleted. additionally, I've noticed that the moon is not in the correct spot, at all. where I'm at, it's rising in the east and setting in the south. I have a feeling somebody is adjusting the orbit of the moon and the tilt of the earth, especially this last year or so]

could the loud sounds that were heard be the hydrogen gas from the "dust shell" -- which contains all the elements but I imagine is mostly hydrogen and protons (H+). when HHO gas is ignited it will create a loud sound and produce water. here's a youtube video demonstration: https://youtu.be/d85OX6yEwE0?t=77

I don't think they're steam explosions, and the repurposing of the O2 in the atomosphere into water could explain for the massive amount of water and difficulty breathing.

the last thing I wanted to mention is that the appearance of the "tusks" may be due to the fact that when you look up at the sun the poles are on the left and right sides. in all of the images of those nova events, the poles have massive jets -- which could be perhaps seen as tusks. the "dust shell" would appear like a giant vertical column both above and below the sun -- a sort of cross shape in the sky.
