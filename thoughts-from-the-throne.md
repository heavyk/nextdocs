this is where I give my personal opinion on some things that really matter to me

### 2022-11-11 10:57 - seeing what their looking at

I've been contemplating this whole thing about the perspective of the characters a bit. one thing that really grinds my gears is that from the 3rd person perspective, it's difficult to see what that person is looking at. I like seeing what I'm looking at, and so imagine for a moment if I were to look through that character's perspective. I want to see what the character is looking at. I want to (at least have the option to) see *from the perspective of the character* -- because without it, you don't really *feel* what the character is feeliing.

in the end, what makes us different is how each of us perceives the world -- and I'm not talking about in the visual sense, because I disregard a lot of that data anyway -- but think about how differently I see the world, not visually, but ideologically, conceptually, mechanically, technologically, -- all of it. I want to be able to see the world like that character sees the world. a lot of children do this in their very early stages of life. I still have maintained the capacity myself, and so that's why I'm so quick to understand a person's perspective, because I can *feel* it from them, and by being able to understand them (that's why my logical, technological, ideological perspectives are so different, is cause I can see it from so many perspectives. I like my perspective the most though. it's clearly superior to every other one that I've encountered.

all characters (fictional or not) of an author are aspects of the author. now, imagine that I can perceive myself as the universe. that means that every single person out there (even all of the bad ones) are all aspects of me. the reason for this is because I believe that 100% of physical reality is attracted, and so therefore, I am responsible for 100% of the stuff that's happening in my perspective.

there are a lot of other things happening out there that are not in my perspective too, and that's totally fine. it's all attraction, so those things are attracted by other things of my perspective. (like proxy attraction -- I attract a person that also attracts that good/bad thing). because my perspective is actually pretty good of so many people, I tend to attract the good part of a person, but that is not always the case. I've always had a swarm of ambitious types around me all of my life and that's (I believe) because most of them are much more sensitive than they admit, and they can sense energy as I have as something desirable (often times manifests as desire to take advantage). because of this, I'm highly desirable.

don't you see? you can become highly desirable just by learning to understand a lot of other people's perspectives? all you have to do is to understand them, and see it all as attraction. more perspectives, more dimensions.

### 2022-12-19 20:03 - telling people it takes a lot of hard work to follow your dreams

rich people don't work very hard at all, but they have this thing to try and prove it to others that they work really hard. mabye hard working in the whore house or something else involving coke... then, they go and fucking tell others that they work really reallly hard. like we're supposed to give them all this symapthy and respect. that's the motivation from their angle, but for the common person what this looks like is that you have to work really hard to be able to follow your dreams.

there are two major problem with "following your dreams" -- which I will illustrate simply with the counter-phrase, "follow your heart". mine is an imperative while the other is a possibility. that difference alone should illuminate a lot. the next problem is the dreams bit. really doesn't happen like it does in your dreams. I recommend a very physical approach, which is why I say follow my heart.

I want to say something about this though which is that the heart is the destination, not the journey. the heart only *really* happens (without stimulus) after you've mastered the emotional/conceptual enough to be able to guide the heart. the heart is the access to the 4th ray, spectral. if you wanna do it, start slow and master the emotions so that the conceptual is open now so the transition into that 4th ray space from the conceptual (solar plexus, gut). [I spoke of this from the throat perspective](/vapidshamen.md#2022-12-19-1940---the-way-of-the-whale), as well.
