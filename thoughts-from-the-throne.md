this is where I give my personal opinion on some things that really matter to me

### 2022-11-11 10:57 - seeing what their looking at

I've been contemplating this whole thing about the perspective of the characters a bit. one thing that really grinds my gears is that from the 3rd person perspective, it's difficult to see what that person is looking at. I like seeing what I'm looking at, and so imagine for a moment if I were to look through that character's perspective. I want to see what the character is looking at. I want to (at least have the option to) see *from the perspective of the character* -- because without it, you don't really *feel* what the character is feeliing.

in the end, what makes us different is how each of us perceives the world -- and I'm not talking about in the visual sense, because I disregard a lot of that data anyway -- but think about how differently I see the world, not visually, but ideologically, conceptually, mechanically, technologically, -- all of it. I want to be able to see the world like that character sees the world. a lot of children do this in their very early stages of life. I still have maintained the capacity myself, and so that's why I'm so quick to understand a person's perspective, because I can *feel* it from them, and by being able to understand them (that's why my logical, technological, ideological perspectives are so different, is cause I can see it from so many perspectives. I like my perspective the most though. it's clearly superior to every other one that I've encountered.

all characters (fictional or not) of an author are aspects of the author. now, imagine that I can perceive myself as the universe. that means that every single person out there (even all of the bad ones) are all aspects of me. the reason for this is because I believe that 100% of physical reality is attracted, and so therefore, I am responsible for 100% of the stuff that's happening in my perspective.

there are a lot of other things happening out there that are not in my perspective too, and that's totally fine. it's all attraction, so those things are attracted by other things of my perspective. (like proxy attraction -- I attract a person that also attracts that good/bad thing). because my perspective is actually pretty good of so many people, I tend to attract the good part of a person, but that is not always the case. I've always had a swarm of ambitious types around me all of my life and that's (I believe) because most of them are much more sensitive than they admit, and they can sense energy as I have as something desirable (often times manifests as desire to take advantage). because of this, I'm highly desirable.

don't you see? you can become highly desirable just by learning to understand a lot of other people's perspectives? all you have to do is to understand them, and see it all as attraction. more perspectives, more dimensions.

### 2022-12-19 20:03 - telling people it takes a lot of hard work to follow your dreams

rich people don't work very hard at all, but they have this thing to try and prove it to others that they work really hard. mabye hard working in the whore house or something else involving coke... then, they go and fucking tell others that they work really reallly hard. like we're supposed to give them all this symapthy and respect. that's the motivation from their angle, but for the common person what this looks like is that you have to work really hard to be able to follow your dreams.

there are two major problem with "following your dreams" -- which I will illustrate simply with the counter-phrase, "follow your heart". mine is an imperative while the other is a possibility. that difference alone should illuminate a lot. the next problem is the dreams bit. really doesn't happen like it does in your dreams. I recommend a very physical approach, which is why I say follow my heart.

I want to say something about this though which is that the heart is the destination, not the journey. the heart only *really* happens (without stimulus) after you've mastered the emotional/conceptual enough to be able to guide the heart. the heart is the access to the 4th ray, spectral. if you wanna do it, start slow and master the emotions so that the conceptual is open now so the transition into that 4th ray space from the conceptual (solar plexus, gut). [I spoke of this from the throat perspective](/vapidshamen.md#2022-12-19-1940---the-way-of-the-whale), as well.

### 2023-02-17 11:57 - the saturnian constant frequency

in saturnian form of thinking that's called I think "zero-sum", where the balance of all equations must equal to zero. I find this really really irritating, because the result of all such equations don't *need* to result in zero; sino in constast they could result in *any* equation. zero is just as good as one; or, any other number. any number is just as good as any liear, quadratic, or any number of terms in real, imaginary, or otherwise numbers. it really doesn't matter. zero is defined by everyone individually -- including things that we do not think of as conscious havve their constant set to whatever. saying that all must equal to zero is as undefined as saying the sum of +Infinity and -Infinity should sum to zero. not so, in fact I say that it could be any number, number, funcion or even a concept itself, like Infinity, a hero, an inspiration, a muse, or an abtract idea or in spiration.

the      end

#### 2023-02-17 12:08 - followup: chris is the number 57

I was looking at the timestamp up there, and 11:57 reminds me of a foothill transit that passed all the time often taking me home, and often times with chris. I also remember in one of my programs, I calculated him to be 57 and me 69 -- and I don't remember why, but I always associated 1157 with him. strange memory.

### 2023-02-17 12:12 - I associate chris with saturn as well

there are a number of people in my life that are strangely saturnian. the saturnian energy also feels like tibetan energy, and I think it comes out of the earth and there are particular places where that energy is strong and it dramatically increases people's attraction power.

the uninitiated, because attraction is so fast, they tend to see the same life and history repeated over and over in Time because they don't have any new inputs. they have a culurally constructed reality, which keeps the different villages separated from each other. it's a lot of micro groups, and these groups try to get smaller all the time, all the way down to one person. however, the culture, keeping them repeating the repetetive let's say frequency, hum, or buzz of a culture group from experiencing anything new, sort of exist in a sort of stasis.

anyway, these saturnian people have a very distinct set of qualities: they often times have tremendous imaginary capacities, but they don't use them. they're complete automatons, living in a reality of their own creations. whatever it is, it's got to have really high graphics.

why, they don't use their impressive imaginations to actually create what they want, I don't know, however my guess is that their fears and inadequacy, self-deprecation, and I -- I don't really know. you know, this one just totally doesn't understand to me. like, you know I would say man, with those graphics do something awesome? it seems that most of these especially imaginative types also don't like tesla, and have even gone so far as to make an electric car to kind of re authorize the name a bit. I detected it also in dr. adams as well as jason (and obviously chris).

what I think it is, is a sort of jealousy that they can't use their imagination to do anything really significantly positive with it, because then there's always a falldown later. speaking from their perspective:

    I can only think of really gross, awful, pleasurable, (desirable things that I would *only* to happen to me), or mundane, fearful, lacking engineering application, (not to be taken seriously), or nothing signficant, not worth it, too hard, (something for someone else to do because it's so obvious), or something I'm jealous someone else is doing, or something I'm envious to have, etc. -- and so, I cannot *possibly* allow myself to experience that *really* great thing. there's *no way*, it could never, *e-ver* be manifest as something *that* good -- you know, not for me.

prepare to die :) you ready for your wildest imaginations to come to life? ready to experience your imagination? let's keep mine blank, shall we?

### 2023-03-11 16:01 - why not art versions

one thing that really grinds my gears about things like movies and songs is that they can only "remaster" or (whatever it's called for film) -- when, it feels like pieces of art should be treated more like software. like, what movies and songs were treated more like plays. each production increases from the previous one. different things are kept and different things are slightly altered, see what the audience's response is, story holes filled and audio/dialoge tweaked, etc.

so, then imagine for a moment a great movie that you've seen, where you think they did a great job, but it'd be nice to have another exactly the same (dialogue and everything) but in HD and better audio. nowadays, with CG and everything, it's not inconceivable to have the original actors looking the same as in the original version. for example, imagine "star wars" with actors that looks like leah and hamil (sounds like a play, even) as they did back 50ya -- you know, I'm sure it's even possible to use the original voiceovers and everything so that the actors can be overdubbed with the "proper" voice (and all sorts of other hollywood magic) to make the original experience better by recreating it in a slightly different (but improved way)?

this rant extends far beyond art and all the way into law and politics, so I'll spare you the rant -- but I'm sure you couldr imagine it. it just really annoys me that so many things in our everyday experience *could* be better, but we consider them "set in stone" (ie. not rebuilt until quite a disaster occurs)
