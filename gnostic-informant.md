### 2023-04-11 14:50 - lots to talk about

I've been watching various shows on your channel, and I have a lot to say. previously I'd only watched the ones that you did with jason, but recently I started watching some more on christian related stuff.

#### gangster jesus

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/07PKqAfCwOY)

this video covers a lot of subjects. in the beginning of watching it, I had a lot of reactions regarding dr ammon's portrayal of jesus as being a sort of gangster. before I delve into my theories about that, I'd like to point out that the return of such a gangster jesus, is already present on this earth in the form of nosebook. that's how they operate -- and if you think that I'm somehoww unaware of their child porn and trafficking, drugs (probably not in the normal form, but in using the technology to manipulate the glands used to produce endogenous DMT and other neuraltransmitters), and all sorts of other stuff; of course I'm aware of them and what they're doing -- but this is where dr. ammon goes a little bit off -- which is that there's nothing he (me, or you) can really do about it.

what gangster jesus (or any other criminal organisation, including the vatican) is doing, has nothing to do with us. all of reality is *attracted*, and so therefore, the people that get taken advanttage of by them, or "victimised" in any way, was (and I can assure you of this) *attracted*. nobody can attract for anyone else, because that would be a violation of self-consciousness and free-will. so whatever. additionally, I am not (and nobody else either) should be trying to save anyone, because you're not really saving them -- you're only saving yourself (because you can't attract for them). you can give them ideas and stuff about how to improve what they're focusing on, which is what your channel is all about, which is really great, but ultimately whatever they choose to focus on and make their reason for attracting what they are in life, is theirs.

now, in that video you talked about these criminal early church gangsters (including vespassian) doing all of these power-displays, such as healing flying and force strangling people (or stopping their heart). this power, was not theirs, I'm fairly sure -- just like today all of nosebook's capabilities are not their own. they're simply using someone else's power (namely mine), to run their whole criminal network. it's a complete repeat of what's happened before. I'm not sure exactly how all of these power-display posers acqiured this power, but what I do suppose is that it was freely given to them by whomever was the origin of that power. I do suspect it had to do with sex -- probably gay sex, as that'll allow the transferrence of *percepttion* from one man to another.

#### scape goat and yom kippur

one of the things that you've brought up a few times in the few videos I watched (bart and tovia) is the idea of jesus being a sort of "scape goat". they both told you it wasn't a symbolic match, but I think you brought it up intuitively, cause I think it might be a thing. I learned about it only yesterday, so I'll repeat what I heard and then illuminate. the idea is that one goat is given all of the sins and is let go, meanwhile the other one (without any sins) is sacrificed.

I'm fairly certain that's what happened, actually -- as the goat (jesus with the power) was given all of the sin, and then let go to have a wife and produce a unicorn bloodline, meanwhile another guy was the one crucified. the guy that was crucified would have been a guy somewhat like me, where he knows that the body is not the end of beingness, and is neither who you *really* are. the way that I feel the crucifed jesus, is something like the way I feel mars. this guy is designed to ensure that the "worst" manfestation is what happens, and he reminds me a lot of elijah (who also feels like mars to me), more than moses.

I can only say this intuitively, as I don't have anything to say with facts here, but mars and anatau are kind of like cupid and psyche in that they're duals of each other. for cupid, this is the feeling of physical desire (+1). psyche is the manifestation of that physical desire out inoto physical (-7). meanwhile anatau/lilith is pure desire in the form of the absolute "worst" possible thing: the most destruction possible, to create the maximum amount of desire for something now -- which then, her opposite will be mars (+7), the manifestation of that maximum desire, so just like psyche is the manifestation of emissive desire/lust, mars is the manifestation of receptive desire/lust; a real glutton for punishment.

#### day of YHVH vs thousand years reign of christ

I noticed when reading isiah yesterday that there's this idea of "the day of the LORD", or "the day of YHVH". well, as I was looking it up, it occurred to me that (as tovia pointed out), these prophesies are not come to pass, and were definitely *not* fulfilled by jesus (in any way, no matter how they massage the texts). therefore, this is a coming time in the future. the "day" is probably also another 1000y period (I believe relating to the sun), but that 1000y period is experienced differently: one with YHVH/mars and the other with gangsta jesus (the christ).

clearly, there is a split between the jews and the christians in their ideas of what it means to have a saviour and all that stuff. I don't really know how to rectify all of this stuff, as for me the booke of revelation has a lot of very violent (and gay) imagery assocated with it. but then again, so does quite a few of the other OT passages where YHVH is telling them not to kill (one of the commandments), but then go ahead and wipe out the enemies of YHVH, including women and children. I can't really find anything good about any of them, where I can say, "clearly this one has the right idea that I want to follow".

the thing is, for both YHVH and gangster jesus (and the many church criminals), these teachings are pretty reflective of the leadership associated with them (and their adherents). I feel like edits have been happening on both sides, but the ones making the edits have moved over from manipulating the jewish texts over to the church, and then nowadays to nosebook, where they're continuing their reality manipulation and editing (I am well aware of). however, if we separate out all of these reality manipulations, there is something to be redeemed for both the jews and also for the christians (probably muslims too, but I know very little about that).

in isaiah and also in zephaniah, there's this bit on the last days (the end of time, the day of YHVH), the remnant (those that don't go to the ones that like manipulation), will not have deceit in their mouths, and have no intention of war. clearly, this is talking of a future time, in which technology has arrived to such a point that all physical experience is recorded, and you'll be able to access and share the past "memory" and physical experience of yourself and others -- and so, in such a society like that (this is one that I'm personally committed to building), deceit and war are simply unthinkable.

imagine children that have been raised in a system where anyone can share the experience of someone else, the concept of deceit isn't even a thing, because there's no illusion of being able to gain an advantage to hiding things. that's one aspect. the otther aspect is obviously telepathy; if I can feel everyone elses thoughts and emotions around me very strongly, it seems incomprehensible to even try and deceive anyone, because I can also tell when others are being deceptive and they me. in either situation, this day of the LORD is talking about a far into the future time when we're perceiving wanted pretty much exclusively, and so perception of unwanted (I don't want this other person I'm competing with to know something, so I can be *first*) is no longer a thing.

I hate to wreck any jewish ideas about this, but such a society living in the day of YHVH implies that everyone will be seeing from the *last* perspective instead of the first, meaning that competition is no longer a thing, as everyone else is perceived to be in front anyway, and all such new "first" things are arrived to as a collaborative effort. huh, this concept isn't understood the way I mean it...

when I or anyone else arrives to something, it's done because of inspiration -- or, tuning into the idea as I like to say. you have an infinite number of future timelines -- some where you tune into the thing firstly (amongst your peers), and some you do not. in other timelines, someone else tunes in firstly before you -- but that doesn't make you incapable -- just unreceptive. additionally, to claim firstness is to claim that you don't have a "source" which is the infinite expanse of all possiblities, where you or anyone else could be first.

is first the first person to tune into the radio station, or the first person to feel the sound vibration hear their ears, the composer, the inspiration the composer heard in their head, or the full sequence of notes that eventually became the final product?

all aspects of creation are a *spectrum*, and it's only us (consciousness) that defines the barriers or borders of where something begins and ends. first and last are entirely artificial, and are only illustrative of our competition between each other.
