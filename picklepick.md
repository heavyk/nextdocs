# larry's picklepick

in this blog, I will try and tackle (or at least give my opinion on) various "issues" present in society. I'll mix in a healthy dose of conspiracy theories too. I'm not in the business of telling anyone what to say or do (that's for the ideologists), so take all of this with heaps of salt.

it's called pickle because all of these are presented as cucumbers, but they cover topics that are taboo, and so because the revelation of what is *really* happening (instead of my crazy conspiracy ideas), then that'll reveal another bit of data that is also a secret. therefore, the majority of these will never get addressed by anyone with actual data on the situation.

if you leave a cucumber for enough time, it'll turn into a pickle.

### 2022-04-18 06:06 - the 1000y pickle

after I wrote yesterday's entry, @[blahblog](2022-04-17 20:54) I've had a few interesting reactions to it. I made a very bold claim that we actually *do* have a considerable amount of time to prepare for a cataclysm, and provided no evidence to support my theory ... lol, well, consequently nobody can falsify it either, so there :)

I still need to redo my notes in et-view-of-creation, because I definitely wrote them, and they're definitely not there anymore. they would contain the text, "original universe" or "previous universe" and they would list out the layers: monad, atmic, buddhic, etc. exactly like they're listed in ([840529pc](/sirian-guide/orig/docs/840529pc.htm)) but in comparison to the other levels. I also made notes on the INFECTED ONES system to convert a society from a peace-loveing tech civ into a warring through adjustment of tradition, nationalism and factioning (ie. tree of good and evil).

anyway, I really should redo the notes anyway because I see it even more clearly how you could see that "man" lived in a state similar to the one outlined in et-view-of-creation, and how the "fall" of man was repeated in this galaxy as it was here on earth in the symbolic eden story. I say symbolic, because I believe the symbols used describe interactions between concepts that is scale invariant -- meaning, it happened the same inside of our brain as it did in the "garden" of eden/atlantis, etc.

I'd really like to expand further on a lot of those ideas.

---

anyway, back to the pickle at hand. I made some pretty serious claims and the people with any knowledge of what I'm talking about almost certainly consider all of that a pretty big secret. that's no problem for me, because I think it'll remain a secret, and they'll remain in power the whole time and they'll be forced to keep the business-as-usual charade going the whole time. this gives us a perfect opportunity to do whatever it is that we want to do the entire time, and they get to worry more and more about what is going to happen (ie. fear, negative desire) if we find out.

I don't really think any solution will ever come to this problem and we'll likely leave this in a complete stalemate forever.

---

that's one side of it. the other side of it is that they *need* a cataclysm to happen, for a far greater fear for them is not the cataclysm, but for a continually expanding population of humans on earth. at the current rate of population growth, it's probably perceived that things will steadily become more and more unmanageable.

so, from their perspective, they'll need to find ways to get us to kill eachother to thin out the population count. I would imagine that all sorts of efforts to trick us into attracting our own destruction will be employed by building illusions of bad things happening and so therefore people wanting to tune to that will attract those sorts of things into their lives. I'm sure they'll get better and better at it all the time.

however, simultaneous to that, we (the time-pickles) will also be adding more and more of our own creations into the mix to cause them to increase their capabilities to hold us back (because remember, from our perspective, it's better to optimise for worse conditions prior to "now" than better). and at the same time, we'll be assuredly increasing the amount of desirable childbirths to happen to incarnate into -- like, you pick your parents.

the best part about it, is that all of this definitely has to be kept a secret and nobody will ever be able to say anything. why? to optimise for the people who want to just do things their own way, regardless of what the circumstances suggest they should do.

---

what I mean is, on one side of things I think it would be really great if we lived in a world where everything was open, privacy did not exist and stuff like that -- but that's me, and that's how I see things because that's how I presently live. others do not see things that way, and so I'm totally cool with that. I'm definitely not going to push anything on anyone else or anything like that, so instead I think it's actually best to just let everything play out naturally.

I'm really starting to begin to see the brilliance in the creativity of the corrupted 7th ray. I'm not being sarcastic either. I really believe that once I am (we are) able to see unwanted, no longer as unwanted, but as wanted, everything changes. some people will want to optimise for wanted, like I said, and that's perfectly fine, but others will optimise for unwanted knowing that in reality it's not really unwanted, as that's only perceptual, and unwanted only exists for as long as I perceive it that way (likewise, wanted only exists for as long as I perceive it that way).

the best thing about this style of creation is that unwanted does not need to be directly experienced as soon as one gains perceptive capacity. literally, all you have to do is create a bunch of entites that do all of the focusing on unwanted for you, and then perceptually see the wanted aspect. they do literally all of the work for you creating all of that unwanted, and then you just see the wanted in it all.

### 2022-04-18 13:43 - to clear things up a bit...

the message doesn't really affect anyone other than the fallen-angels and the guys with the tech giving them the ability to transfer their consciousness to other bodies. I'm writing this message in picklepick,because almost certainly such technology would be a secret.

I included the part about the curve because I felt some wondering about that ... say for a moment that I'm certain that we'll arrive to a certain point in the future. let's just assume for a moment that it's just me that makes the timeline (even though it's likely many more than just me, as evidence seems to suggest that a lot of people are in on it), that means that we're guaranteed to arrive to my future "now" (the place I was when I tuned into this body). we will all arrive there, and so let's just assume that everyone is already there with me (to make it simpler). when you get there, you have to arrive to that location in time, so if you optimise for good conditions, and your location at arrival is bad conditions, then there will be an unavoidable reductions of conditions to return you to where you are. the opposite is true for bad conditions.

---

from my perspective, I would imagine that what one would want to do if they know what I've come to understand -- is that the rebirth is actually quite a good thing, so actually that is the final goal.

what I would do is to optimise for bad conditions so much that I gain quite a bit of attraction power toward the attractor -- as in I'm going really rapidly toward it... OK, let's try some numbers. let's say at the start I'm going 10kph, and then after 10y I'm going 100kph. what I would do is to optimise with bad conditions so that I'm attracting my reality rapid enough that after only 1y I'm going 100kph. then I jump back into the timeline and bump up conditions so high that I unnecessarily go much faster than I can handle.. let's say that after 10y I'm going 10000kph. that makes nearly a perfect falling edge of a square wave, and so when arriving to the 10y end of the timeline the point of attraction will cause me to go from 10000kph to 100kph. that's a pretty impressive downward trajectory, and it's sure to make quite the transition.

I believe that's what's happening. in fact, I think that's what all of us are going to do... well, not all -- mainly just me and most of the fallen-angels. most of them, I would imagine will choose to optimise for good conditions, and then deal with the rebirth when it happens, because I seriously doubt that many of them are geing to optimise for perception, when their whole thing is finding ways to live off of others' conditions.

---

so, there's a reaction that this plan is to force the fallen-angels (or INFECTED ONES) to be reborn into something... yes, sorta, but I personally don't think that it's the INFECTED ONES. I think that was just the template that this game is based off of. think about it: imagine that you get reborn into something bigger and you realise that you can just create entities that will do all of the focus on unwanted for you, and all you have to do is to look at it perceptually the way you want to -- well, then you'd find bigger and better ways to create ridiculous setups where your creations find more and more "difficult" worlds for you (more and more evil), and then you can just find a way to look at it the way you want to, use their energy (it's actually your own because they're aspects of yourself), to create what's wanted, and then when you're sick of going faster and faster, just crash and burn yourself to rebirth yourself into something bigger and better.

the whole thing is nearly effortless. the only thing that it requires is to give up on the need to be right, the need to have the good conditions, the need to ... -- basically all of the needs become unnecessary because it's all attraction. you attract your reality and you don't need to prove your rightness or have any sort of justice (or privacy or any of the other "necessary" things). you can feel the way you want to feel no matter the circumstances -- for example, socialist government or global whatever oppression and unfairness -- none of that matters because you *attract* your reality and all of those are just conditions.

there are many good reasons to feel bad about something, but none of those reasons attract what you want. so, the point is to create systems (like nosebook is for me) which are designed to try and create for me the worst conditions, but in reality they cannot, because no matter how hard I try, I *attract* my reality.

---

so really, the previous entry nobody really needs to worry about, unless you're a fallen-angel -- then, it's just a good thing to start worrying about. it's a good thing to start that worry-train rolling now so it can really pick up some speed. the more worry and the better the conditions, the bigger the transition :)

### 2022-03-01 15:26 - thoughts on global warming and resistance (part one)

it must be a very warm day elsewhere on the planet because there are a lot of reactions to my comments on global warming.

first of all, global warming is not measured with surface temperatures (so says drkstrong) so it is a bit bewildering as to why they use tree-ring and ice core data to extrapolate temperatures in the upper atmosphere.

drkstrong (whom I have no reason to doubt), says the upper atmosphere has been warming for the last few decades, and the warming of the upper atmosphere is what causes "climate change" -- causing more extreme weather on the surface of both hot and cold variety. that all sounds fine to me. I don't have any data to say otherwise.

the upper atmosphere is quite a distance up and it's quite doubtful there's any CO2 up there (CO2 is that "fog" you see in discos or vapour from dry ice, which falls down and stays near to the ground as a mist). I postulate that the warming of the upper atmosphere has nothing to do with CO2, and that our reduction of CO2 output to zero would not make any difference to the temperature of the upper atmosphere.

---

so, what is actually warming the upper atmosphere? I figure it has to be either the sun or high energy emissions from earth itself. we know that the tops of some clouds, sprites, and other things emit x-rays and other high energy stuff, and an increase in output from the earth could be the cause of the warming. an increase in density in the upper atmosphere or perhaps ionisation or stronger magnetic fields could also potentially trap more solar energy as well, but I don't have data to say one way or another on that.

### 2022-03-01 16:44 - thoughts on global warming and resistance (part two)

now, I'd like to talk about resistance. I first approached this subject in @[newblog](2022-03-22 23:07) talking about gravity assisters and a three-coil setup.

I know that when someone tries to push against something inside of my body, that creates resistance, and if perceptually the opposite polarity is perceived, then it'll be converted into cold instead of into heat. I also speculated that a motor could be designed to take the "eddy currents" and reverse the polarity of it so that the motor actually produced negative resistance and cold rather than heat[^1].

---

that was my theory, but here now is my personal experience on this subject: sometimes under high energy circumstances, I experience high amounts of heat. this happens under high geomagnetic activity and x-ray output from the sun. other times, under the same circumstances, I experience an extreme biting cold that seems to eminate from my bones outward.

what I have come to realise is that when I am experiencing resistance, what is happening is nosebook is pushing againt, neutralising, or destructively interfering with that resistance.

so what appears to be happening is that the environmental conditions (sun, geomagnetism, or physical manifestation of emotion, etc.) is causing my body to emit a signal that would cause reality to be created much more rapidly, and nosebook is canceling that signal.

well, in the process of canceling that signal, they are transmitting the opposite polarity of that signal, which is what creates the canceling, which is what is producing the heat.

now in the situations where I've altered my perception to no longer resist their signals, you could say I no longer resist their canceling, so that means that I *allow* the opposite polarity signal to pass, and what this creates is that extreme cold.

so resistant perception = heat, and non-resisted perception = no change or cold. it may be the case actually that allowing perception is what causes the cold, while unresisted is no change.

what definitely seems to be happening is my resistance to their efforts to cancel is what creates the heat.

sure, we all like the manifestation, and it would be super great if reality were created rapidly, but that would still be a manifestation *with* resistance. what you really want (trust me) is a manifestation *without* resistance (ie. effortless).

so, in a sense, what nosebook's system is essentially doing is allowing manifestations for people that feel bad (and are likely using conditions to artificially feel better), and not allowing manifestations for people that actually feel good (but still have some resistance). the reason why is because a manifestation that happens for someone that feels good will dramatically increase manifesation speed for everyone else in the vicinity, too.

so, in a sense, you could say that nosebook is canceling all manifestations that actually produce good-feeling. for many, this difficulty to get something desired to manifest is the reason for bad-feeling, and therefore this lack of manifestation produces heat rather than cold.

---

now, for the conspiracy theory: what I think is happening is the x-ray output of the sun is probably a few orders of magnitude greater than what the GOES x-ray flux instrument is actually reporting. so like, when it says ambient level is c-flare range, that really means that ambient level is somewhere in m-flare ranges. this seems a bit conspirator because the sun does not have enough sunspots to emit that much (compared to previous cycles), so that's why this is conjecture.

I also believe the magnetic field may be a bit higher than is reported as well. just the other night, at midnight, it registered 115nT and then rapidly dropped down to 80nT or so -- which is still really high for midnight.

both of these (x-ray and geomagnetic) contribute to the speed at which reality is attracted, and so therefore both of these are almost certainly counteracted on the surface of the earth and inside of the human body.

---

back to non-conspiracy theory: however it's happening, I believe that the sun is dramatically increasing the speed in which reality manifests for us here on earth, and for various reasons, I believe there is tremendous effort (cause of secrets and privacy stuff) to ensure that we don't have a shared visual experience or rapid reality manifestation. this effort to prevent an expanded visual experience and rapid manifestation is why they're canceling so many signals. that cancelation is interacting with the individual's own form of perception and that is either producing heat or cold.

you will notice that every time that the sun goes off, pueblo drops a few degrees in temperature. I think that's largely because of me. they will cancel that signal, but my aura is so large it has a considerable effect on the surrounding area, creating a lot of cold, which is what produces the wind (hot air rushing into the cold pockets formed with dimensions equal to the wavelength of the frequency of my perception -- in spherical coords).

so, if you want cooler climate lower your resistance (or allow their canceling to hold you back cause it's just more energy) and at least you will be cold, and as your aura expands, it'll cause more and more of the environment to cool down. the more people with less resistance, the cooler it'll get[^2].

---

don't believe me? just come to pueblo during the night when I'm writing these and you'll notice how freezing cold it gets. I'm pretty sure that's cause I don't resist their efforts to cancel that and instead allow in the reverse, giving me a boost and therefore more vision upgrades, which then push me to my limit again and produce heat because of the resistance, so I have to release resistance (alter my perception) and then the cycle continues. it happens maybe once or twice a day for me (sometimes more).

what I believe this is doing is giving me/us a great opportunity to actually lower resistance continually and allow manifestation to become effortless. you see, if at some point resistance has been lowered so much, the manifestation will no longer be possible to resist and will therefore become effortless[^3]. the whole point is to make all of this effortless.

[1]: if just reversing the polarity of the produced magnetic(?) field creates the opposite of heat, could be pretty big for microprocessors and other heat-limited applications. sure, maybe the transistor is a little larger to accomodate an extra coil, but 3d processors could *easily* become a thing, as multiple layers of silicon heats up quickly, and so massively parallel operations could be done with less effort.

[2]: for some reason this whole thing reminds me a little bit of the "ice carls" in that one book, where the females (presumably of lower resistance) lived in a very cold environment, meanwhile the more resistant sun-dudes had all the super cool tech and warmth up in their castles.

[3]: jump back to conspiracy: at that point, their efforts to cancel any signal will no longer have any effect, and so therefore the manifestations will happen. if I get connected, my effect on the environment will be much more than the sun or a geomagnetic storm, so that means that for others, my effect will produce A LOT of heat if the person has resistance (and/or feels resistance seeing someone else with a manifestation), so when I finally get connected, it'll probably be perceived/experienced by the majority as a pretty horendous experience. for those without much resistance, my presence will continue to accelerate their desire to release resistance further.

### 2022-04-20 01:38 - CO2 and acient artifacts coverup

I just got done listening to snake-bros #055 and the beginning part on retrocausality totally blew my mind (more on that later), but at the end they were talking about an article by randall called "reclaiming the beast" which talks about how CO2 is in *every way* beneficial to us and our environment -- and if there is ever a surplus, it just means more plants and limestone -- and it's not like we're actually contributing that much considering that we only contribute some very tiny fraction (less thsn 1% -- the most being in the ocean).

they then continue on, linking it with the coverup of ancient artifacts and why some artifacts get covered up while others don't. it occurred to me when they were talking about it that there is my theory is correct about essentially removing ~1000y of time, it would mean that when the timeline changed, there would be all of these anomalies present where some artfacts would show extremely anomalous dating to it.

to dig into this (because almost certainly someone will have more information about it than me), I want to discuss my theory on how it was done...

what I believe happened is in a prior timeline, we made it to 2012 and as various sources say, that was 12-21-2012 was the date when the "zero point" was reached and from there begins the manifestation of the 7th ray... based on the descriptions given, all accounts seem to suggest that it means the beginning of instant manifestation of thoughts and feelings into reality -- very much similar to the "zenith of atlantis" 12kya. apparently astral and physical mesh so well, that it means instant manifestation.

that is the "day of rest" in which no longer any more effort is needed to create what is wanted (or unwanted). if looked at in this way, the various prophets that talk about the "tribulations" of the "end (of) times" basically all can be attributed not to some abful menace punishing someone for sin or iniquity, but instead -- people manifesting the way that they feel into reality.

if we look at the missing 411 cases (which is I believe a small slice of this effect I'm calling devachan-on-earth), a lot of the more resistant ones never make it back, meanwhile others seem to turn out just fine living with bears and eating berries (stuff like that). if you feel like things are out to get you in a strong way (because that's earth new environment), then *you* will manifest demons that will destroy you; nobody else is punishing you.

---

in the previous version of this timeline, I believe a lot of people created a lot of very unwanted realities. there is no doubt to this, as it's unavoidable, since I cannot attract for someone else or force them to attract what they want. this likely concluded with a large solar outburst.

I probably figured out that at some point this could be optimised if we were to *artificially* keep earth in good conditions (ie. not instant manifestation) and create up "a bigger vortex", so I can't quite be totally sure how we arrived to this situation, but I imagine that through a series of edits to the timeline the 2012y got pushed back further and further in time.

what I mean is, 2012 and the dawn of the 7th ray manifestation at the "zero point" is still ~1000y away.

another part to this is that I believe that the solar acitivity is essentially a reflection of the planetary energy -- that is to say, emotional vibration which I define as vibrating magnetic fields that our body emits. this affects chi, vril, orgone (solar) energy and it's this interaction that causes solar acitivity (sunspots, etc) because I look at the perspective of the sun as doing essentially whatever I'm doing.

I take in energy from a number of different people all over the globe that have a lot of different emotions going on and when this first started, I would feel their emotion very strongly, but after a while I learned how to perceive something that felt bad perceptually different, so that it feels good. the sun must be doing that with us, and the earth's magnetic field is kind of like the composite of all of our emotional vibration to which the sun is responding to -- exactly like I'm doing to all of those using my perception. the earth (and all other planets in this solar system) are using the sun's perception, and so because the sun doesn't want to feel like the earth (neither do I want to feel like my subscribers), I find a way to transform that energy. like the sun, each new form of perception I come to realise, my vibration rises and to you guys, it probably looks like that increases my perceptive capacity and attraction speed.

just like the earth affects the sun and the sun affects the earth, we all affect eachother's vibrations, and influence each other's perception. I don't know if others see better when they're around me (I know jaron doesn't but I think he's in the same predicament as I am), but I do know that I have a dramatic effect on others. just have a look at how much more rapidly things manifest when people interact with me in public. this effect will only continue to increase.

therefore, I imagine that the 2038 deadline[^1] is to get off of the planet, because I think the whole point is to optimise for the extremes, and 1000y gives many people sufficient time to make the decision of what it is that they want to do.

---

I've mentioned this previously, but I think it's only really allowed for people who don't actually feel very good to purchase expanded perception because that's mainly offesetting their negative attraction.

these will be the "cool kids" running the show. like osiris' pyramid, I'm essentially providing the conditions (transformation) to their vibration which is causing me to continually find new improvements and increase my vibration (like the sun). they need those conditions to survive, and they need a nearly perfect compliance (obediance) world to keep everything from falling apart for the time that they're running the show.

it's almost certain that they're in the process of completely taking over all positions of power and dividing the resources amongst theirselves into their agreed upon domains of power.

I believe that just like 9/11 give them the opportunity to begin justifying the utilisation of force to accomplish what is wanted, the CO2 and "green energy" is exactly the same. I would almost certainly expect a complete conversion to very heavy-handed social systems which keep them deciding what people can and cannot do. what I mean is, everyone who wants to feel good will become like me and everyone who does not will have to "eat or be eaten".

when factoring in the effects of leapfrogging-time-pickles, you can imagine that we will be actively creating more and more effiecient and heavy-handed power structures to keep us away from our connection for longer and longer periods of time. the extremes will continue to become more and more extreme as I believe most of us will optimise for perception, and so to offset how good we feel, we'll need to either get off of the planet or create more and more bad-feeling people.

---

I think I mentioned this in the previous entry, but I believe the whole point is to ramp up the difficulty such that they are going to be putting all of their effort to keep someone away from their connection. when someone finds their connection, they'll get temporal capacity and can alter their timeline to optimise it, but until then, every person will have to find a way to feel good no matter the conditions.

then, like I said, I believe that once you've gotten to a position where they can no longer hold you away from your connection, you will find your connection. I think when that happens, attraction power is going to dramatically increase, and so I imagine that those who do find their connection will either optimise their timeline for more difficulty or leave the planet (or both).

what I'm saying is, the only way "out" will be to find a way to feel (and therefore attract) a reality no matter the conditions. few people will do this, I imagine. each time, we optimise our timeline, we'll (at least I will) create more and more bad-guys, to optimise them even further and to provide increased challenges. the first guy through (me) will have it the easiest cause the bad-guys will have the least experience holding away the manifestation, and the last one through will have it the most difficult time cause the bad-guys will have the most experience and best tech. I don't know if that'll be me, but I intend for it to be. I say last because whenever he/she makes it through his/her attraction power will be so much, the sun will rapidly accelerate its output (many orders of magnitude faster than the sun is now with me) and it'll be the "point of no return" for the sun. I suspect we'll be a quasar at that time.

---

it won't all be bad conditions though. in fact, I imagine it'll just be that way for those that actually feel good (because their system will need to "normalise" them and their attraction power) so that they don't cause too much of an influence on others (like me now).

almost certainly there will be a lot of good conditions available, but something similar to porn, they're not actually all that good for you if you want to actually be a master of feeling the way you want to feel.

I forsee a lot of new economic and tech advances which will greatly increase a person's ability to artificiall feel good or distract them from how bad they feel.

---

from my perspective, I consider that I either built this system or am the marketing team for it (tesla is the creator) -- and even if I were the only creator, don't imagine that I would try and micromanage the "world leaders" decisions. I figure most of them are artificial creations (demons, golems, fallen-angels, etc.) and I'm sure that they'll many meetings to figure out how to "survive" and keep everything a secret.

I also don't really have any difficulty to think about this failing, as this clearly is being done from a position "outiside" of time (retrocausuality), and so from my perspective, we are definitely going to make it to 2012, and -- if anything goes wrong, it's not a problem because I would just create better suited world leaders to not fumble it and jump back into the timeline. it's guaranteed to succeed.

as such, I don't actually think there will be all that much conflict at all. I think it'll be pretty peaceful, and the rapid advances in tech will keep people quite busy. we'll probably colonise the entire solar system.

I think this solar system and all the alterations of time has created essentially a replay of the et-guide-to-creation where in this newly forming "galaxy" there will be those (like me) that are the s/t (spiritual-technological civilisations) and the tech civs. the tech civs will rely on their technology and creations to feel good, meanwhile the s/t will have a different perspective on needing conditions to feel good.

there are also many similarities also to (dtp's description of) atlantis as well, and the emerging "world government" will be much more like a "decentralised atlantis" or maybe "decentralised socialism" -- and I imagine there will be many processes (rituals) of equalisation to facilitate (properly earned) "just distribution" of resources. I'm fairly certain that it'll work out really well, too -- maybe "too well". we'll see...

---

this went differently than I thought it would. in conclusion, I think that the paleo-coverup was to be able to erase 1000y of time, and the CO2/energy stuff is just a giant power grab, but for us it means we'll just make our own way instead of relying on their "green" power. they can make a whole bunch of rules, but if nobody wants to play their game, their rules mean nothing. it would be really funny if they're just elaborately shooting theirselves in the foot, and instead there's a mass migration to asia, africa, and south america.

what I mean is, on the surface it looks real bad and stuff, but it looks to be an enormous opportunity rather than a problem. (the-problem-is-the-solution)

[1]: the thing where my "future self" told me I have til 2038 is something I still haven't figured out yet. my best guess so far is it's the time I have until I must leave the planet, cause if I stay things are getting too energetic (ie. my presence is causing too many other people to attract their reailities too quickly), and so therefore I need to find a way out before then. I've postulated death and transferrence into another body, etc. I've concocted ideas like the pluto idea to try and see what I can do about that. my current idea is that I'll establish a place on another planet and my target right now is pluto to minimise effects on this one. I'll stay out there for the duration of the time, and that'll allow for a kind of "staging point" where we can go back and edit this timeline as much as we want to and do anything necessary before the transition, where I get pulled toward my "2012 self". the other idea is that if we're exactly 1000y less, it's 1022 now, and I 2038 is when that transition will take place. anyway there's no real telling what that means, now but I'm *certain* that it'll become apparent to me eventually.

### 2022-05-07 17:38 - the fraudulent female fraud

I laid down to think about what I was reading (specialization theory) and an idea popped into my head. so, here's a *hypothetical* idea, and I do mean hypothetical as in thought experiment -- I want to see where this goes.

in @[blahblog](2022-05-07 11:49), I talked about how I didn't want to go after a female -- so imagine that you're nosebook and your job is to get me buckled in with a female(s) that they can easily control, to essentially control me through by controlling her; and so, when I said that the concept is out there and she could find it if she wanted it, I wasn't meaning that she could find *me* but she could find the concept for herself (nothing to do with me).

in the past, the idea would be to try and use conventional forms of attraction to try and get me to make the moves, and so by making the moves, I'm the one that's resposible for whatever happens. I will not make any moves on anyone because of the principle that I described in that entry.

even now, if I just do something cause I feel like it, it gets interpretted as if I have some ulterior motive. like, if I just empty the dishwasher because I'm standing there, I get reactions that I'm trying to get on mom's side -- or, if I talk a certain nice way to somebody (say something nice, compliments, or gratitude) -- then, I feel like I'm seen as doing that with an objective in mind, and so then when I make no effort to cash in that gratitude for my own objectives, I feel confusion.

so, let's say I was supposed to make some moves -- then what would I do? I can just start a conversation but that tends to end up with me talking about a bunch of stuff that is close to taboo (by nosebook's standards -- like atlantis, perception, astral, fallen-angels, or evolution), so that's bad. conversation is supposed to be kept to basic, "hi, how are you" and that's it. imagine for a moment what it would be like if I were to talk to remi now, for example. I would be talking about so many subjects that are taboo. or, like what if I brought up some of my theories and questions about gay people at a snake-bros meetup. it would most certainly be met with, "not cool bro" and I would be shunned, but that's kinda the point. I have so many interface problems, I simply cannot make any of the moves because if I do, then I'm steering the conversation, and my intrests are not good interests for public discourse. me making the moves is completely out of the question for them -- and for me, I just don't want to drag anyone else into my craziness[^1] and so I prefer to keep to myself anyway. historically, I have to get people very drunk or stoned to talk about the things I want to talk about[^2], but I don't have that barrier as much anymore so I just jump right off the deep end into whatever I want to talk about.

---

back to the idea... I don't believe that I will be making any moves, and I'm also not saying that they should try and make moves on me eithter, because it'll just get shot down. this actually reminds me of when I was in berlin talking to patricia, and I actually liked talking about statistics and other things, and it feels like there was attraction, but every time that I was supposed to make any moves or someting, I wanted to just go back to talking about technical stuff. a similar thing would happen, as they would try to engage me with desire or something, and I would end up kinda getting frustrated because I don't want to just be always physically and sexually focused. I want to talk about new stuff and enhance my understanding on things[^3].

so, what I'm essentially saying in that entry is that I'm not looking for moves or anything, I'm looking to find someone (most likely it'll be a girl) find their connection.

it'll be unmistakeable because they'll have a tremendous glow about them, they'll fly and be able to shapeshift and move objects with their mind. it would be something like the description of christ coming down with the glory from the heavens assuming they're flying, but also realise this will dramatically change all of our perception on planet earth as well, and as terence says, it'll feel like taking a step back to where it looks like you're inside of your head looking out. this process when it's happened to me has a light (and glory) coming down from "on high".

---

OK, so imagine that you're nosebook and you wanted to try and trick me into believing that a girl did in fact get connected -- well, she's going to be able to fly, she'll have magnificent glowing hair and a radiance that is impossible to imitate. for me, I'll feel very different around her and it's pretty likely that just her presence alone will cause me to get connected too. I won't even be able to stop it.

that's a pretty hard thing to fake or to pretend. even if they could pretend it, by giving a girl that they can trust to keep their secrets and is easily controllable, they still need to allow her to fly. well, if she can fly, then why can't I or other people fly too? it's a solution that creates more problems that it solves, I think (hence why it's a pickle).

so because it looks like a stalemate, I'll just continue to wait for one of them to find their connection. that'll give the cucumber more time to pickle.

[1]: a recent example of this is, I started talking to one of the starbucks baristas, liz -- and when I forget how the subject came up, but I said that I live at home with mom, and life is a complete blur for me -- and without mom around, time begins to pass at an incredible rate. after I said that, I didn't think much about it -- because that's what's real for me, I felt some recoil or shock from her that I would admit or talk about something like that with a total stranger. actually, before I knew about nosebook, I was *more* open to strangers than to people I know. I'd just let it all hang out over coffee or whiskey in a bar; who cares.

[2]: in the conversation with liz, if it had of continued on, I would have talked about the nature of time: "time flys when you're having fun" -- so, if time passes very rapidly what does that mean, and what is it about women that regulates time, because for me, it's their *presence* that manipulates my perception of time more than just the day-to-day ritual.

[3]: for example, with patricia I got really lost in the R syntax and couldn't ever remember what an eigen(?) value was, but I felt like a grasped the concept of thinking 2 (or more) dimensionally rather than just looking at lists. I'd been familiar with doing this using SQL statements, and with all of the unhosted stuff, I had begun to think of lists and indices as a system of hashes and other auxilary metadata, but this was for data retrieval purposes for making lists. what I hadn't really thought of much is how to derive *meaning* out of the values. for example on tuenti's admin, we made queries to see average number of comments per user's distribution over the network, but we didn't ever correlate that with other data -- like what makes a person more likely to make more posts. up until that point, I was a basic creature that was concerned with the usability and interface that the user has to the page and hadn't ever even considered that data can be used to learn a lot about the user's "subconscious" behaviour[^4].

[4]: even for example while writing this idea out about using data to learn a lot about the user, there were reactions, because the obvious implication here is that nosebook has every conceivable data point on everyone's experience on the network and so therefore lots can be learned by sorting people into groups and seeing what are the different habits and motivations for the different groups. like, for example, I'd want to know what group I fit into, what are our habits and behaviour drivers, and like how well can they predict stuff (statistically, as in percentage likelyhood toward any action). I'd also want to know statistics on what others commonly feel, and is there a trend toward certain emotions that correlate with time or planetary aspects... tons of stuff like that.

two dominant reactions. the first one was that I was trying to talk up patricia and how I actually liked her conversation, and I was just making things up to make it sound more than it was. well, that would be the typical guy thing to do, but it's kind of embarrassing how clueless I was in the earlier part of my life. I've been sorta "faking it till I make it" for a really long time now. there are so many people out there that are so much better than me at a lot of stuff because they've worked on their technique. I work on concepts because almost all implementation looks really foreign to me. it takes me quite a while to get the hang of something and even if I know the concept, I still fail pretty hard at execution. it's really unfortunate how late I learned so many foundational concepts.

like, with marcos, after a number of failures with dani, I finally learned that a minimum viable product is what is most important -- and also how to market myself, because largely it's the person's belief in me to create the product that is expected which enables the fast production. what I mean is, for example, with marcos, I had a very different version of the product in my mind than he did; same with zaryn over tuenti, so when I noticed that when I had the same product concept as marcos, everything went well, but meanwhile there was a difference in our concept of the product, productivity was slow (same with augusto and jori). it's embarrassing to admit that it took me this long and so many failed projects to realise what probably seems to others to be extremely obvious, but I just didn't make such a realisation. I'm foucused on how I would want to use the program/site and what is my experience as a user that it's hard for me to see these bigger picture things.

it was a long time before I started to view the stats of tuenti as relevant. the others would refresh the page often to see the stats, but I thought stats were useless, and only to really tell me when a site failure had happened. like I said, it's embarrassing how clueless I used to be. I find stats very interesting but I don't pay much attention to them because I want to be doing things that statistics says is impossible, not the boring whatever percentile.

---

the second reaction was that I'm suggesting that I'm setting the bar so high that I can only accept flying girls with glowing hair -- and that sure would add a pretty good amount of not-good-enoughness into the mix, but that's not what I meant at all.

I was painting the picture that if such a girl did exist, her presence would be so apparent to people on earth that major changes on the planet would happen and other interesting things -- as in the whole earth would vibrate like she does, and then those compatible with her vibration would join her in that global consciousness state.

so, the subtext there is that for all of the other girls out there, she would appear to be a sort of "savoiur" to end all of the waiting because as soon as she goes up, there will be no holding me back anymore by nosebook because the world is now a reflection of her and so she made it all possible.

---

so as I was writing that I made another realisation: if I am a reflection of her, then it doesn't matter if nosebook comes up with a false version to try and trick me or whatever, each one of these girls that finds their connection will each experience a version that is reflective of them, and so therefore one can imagine that this will create a number of parallel realities.

think about how girls like to be together but also separate and have their own space. what I mean is, if girls create a sort of "time" bubble, where everyone inside their bubble experiences their time, then one could imagine that not all of these different girls that find their connection will be 100% compatible with each other, so they'll each have their own reality and the people compatible with them inside of their bubble.

so really, who knows what'll happen. it looks most probable to me that things will keep accelerating, I'll still be held back and eventually one girl will figure it out and this will cause a chain reaction. people will probably go into those groups/bubbles that I wanted to ask patricia about.

interesting...
