### 2022-03-01 15:26 - some thoughts on global warming and resistance

it must be a very warm day elsewhere on the planet because there are a lot of reactions to my comments on global warming.

first of all, global warming is not measured with surface temperatures (so says drkstrong) so it is a bit bewildering as to why they use tree-ring and ice core data to extrapolate temperatures in the upper atmosphere.

drkstrong (whom I have no reason to doubt), says the upper atmosphere has been warming for the last few decades, and the warming of the upper atmosphere is what causes "climate change" -- causing more extreme weather on the surface of both hot and cold variety. that all sounds fine to me. I don't have any data to say otherwise.

the upper atmosphere is quite a distance up and it's quite doubtful there's any CO2 up there (CO2 is that "fog" you see in discos or vapour from dry ice, which falls down and stays near to the ground as a mist). I postulate that the warming of the upper atmosphere has nothing to do with CO2, and that our reduction of CO2 output to zero would not make any difference to the temperature of the upper atmosphere.

so, what is actually warming the upper atmosphere? I figure it has to be either the sun or high energy emissions from earth itself. we know that the tops of some clouds, sprites, and other things emit x-rays and other high energy stuff, and an increase in output from the earth could be the cause of the warming. an increase in density in the upper atmosphere or perhaps ionisation or stronger magnetic fields could also potentially trap more solar energy as well, but I don't have data to say one way or another on that.
