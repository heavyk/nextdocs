# larry's picklepick

in this blog, I will try and tackle (or at least give my opinion on) various "issues" present in society. I'll mix in a healthy dose of conspiracy theories too. I'm not in the business of telling anyone what to say or do (that's for the ideologists), so take all of this with heaps of salt.

it's called pickle because all of these are presented as cucumbers, but they cover topics that are taboo, and so because the revelation of what is *really* happening (instead of my crazy conspiracy ideas), then that'll reveal another bit of data that is also a secret. therefore, the majority of these will never get addressed by anyone with actual data on the situation.

if you leave a cucumber for enough time, it'll turn into a pickle.

### 2022-04-18 06:06 - the 1000y pickle

after I wrote yesterday's entry, @[blahblog](2022-04-17 20:54) I've had a few interesting reactions to it. I made a very bold claim that we actually *do* have a considerable amount of time to prepare for a cataclysm, and provided no evidence to support my theory ... lol, well, consequently nobody can falsify it either, so there :)

I still need to redo my notes in et-view-of-creation, because I definitely wrote them, and they're definitely not there anymore. they would contain the text, "original universe" or "previous universe" and they would list out the layers: monad, atmic, buddhic, etc. exactly like they're listed in ([840529pc](/sirian-guide/orig/docs/840529pc.htm)) but in comparison to the other levels. I also made notes on the INFECTED ONES system to convert a society from a peace-loveing tech civ into a warring through adjustment of tradition, nationalism and factioning (ie. tree of good and evil).

anyway, I really should redo the notes anyway because I see it even more clearly how you could see that "man" lived in a state similar to the one outlined in et-view-of-creation, and how the "fall" of man was repeated in this galaxy as it was here on earth in the symbolic eden story. I say symbolic, because I believe the symbols used describe interactions between concepts that is scale invariant -- meaning, it happened the same inside of our brain as it did in the "garden" of eden/atlantis, etc.

I'd really like to expand further on a lot of those ideas.

---

anyway, back to the pickle at hand. I made some pretty serious claims and the people with any knowledge of what I'm talking about almost certainly consider all of that a pretty big secret. that's no problem for me, because I think it'll remain a secret, and they'll remain in power the whole time and they'll be forced to keep the business-as-usual charade going the whole time. this gives us a perfect opportunity to do whatever it is that we want to do the entire time, and they get to worry more and more about what is going to happen (ie. fear, negative desire) if we find out.

I don't really think any solution will ever come to this problem and we'll likely leave this in a complete stalemate forever.

---

that's one side of it. the other side of it is that they *need* a cataclysm to happen, for a far greater fear for them is not the cataclysm, but for a continually expanding population of humans on earth. at the current rate of population growth, it's probably perceived that things will steadily become more and more unmanageable.

so, from their perspective, they'll need to find ways to get us to kill eachother to thin out the population count. I would imagine that all sorts of efforts to trick us into attracting our own destruction will be employed by building illusions of bad things happening and so therefore people wanting to tune to that will attract those sorts of things into their lives. I'm sure they'll get better and better at it all the time.

however, simultaneous to that, we (the time-pickles) will also be adding more and more of our own creations into the mix to cause them to increase their capabilities to hold us back (because remember, from our perspective, it's better to optimise for worse conditions prior to "now" than better). and at the same time, we'll be assuredly increasing the amount of desirable childbirths to happen to incarnate into -- like, you pick your parents.

the best part about it, is that all of this definitely has to be kept a secret and nobody will ever be able to say anything. why? to optimise for the people who want to just do things their own way, regardless of what the circumstances suggest they should do.

---

what I mean is, on one side of things I think it would be really great if we lived in a world where everything was open, privacy did not exist and stuff like that -- but that's me, and that's how I see things because that's how I presently live. others do not see things that way, and so I'm totally cool with that. I'm definitely not going to push anything on anyone else or anything like that, so instead I think it's actually best to just let everything play out naturally.

I'm really starting to begin to see the brilliance in the creativity of the corrupted 7th ray. I'm not being sarcastic either. I really believe that once I am (we are) able to see unwanted, no longer as unwanted, but as wanted, everything changes. some people will want to optimise for wanted, like I said, and that's perfectly fine, but others will optimise for unwanted knowing that in reality it's not really unwanted, as that's only perceptual, and unwanted only exists for as long as I perceive it that way (likewise, wanted only exists for as long as I perceive it that way).

the best thing about this style of creation is that unwanted does not need to be directly experienced as soon as one gains perceptive capacity. literally, all you have to do is create a bunch of entites that do all of the focusing on unwanted for you, and then perceptually see the wanted aspect. they do literally all of the work for you creating all of that unwanted, and then you just see the wanted in it all.

### 2022-03-01 15:26 - thoughts on global warming and resistance (part one)

it must be a very warm day elsewhere on the planet because there are a lot of reactions to my comments on global warming.

first of all, global warming is not measured with surface temperatures (so says drkstrong) so it is a bit bewildering as to why they use tree-ring and ice core data to extrapolate temperatures in the upper atmosphere.

drkstrong (whom I have no reason to doubt), says the upper atmosphere has been warming for the last few decades, and the warming of the upper atmosphere is what causes "climate change" -- causing more extreme weather on the surface of both hot and cold variety. that all sounds fine to me. I don't have any data to say otherwise.

the upper atmosphere is quite a distance up and it's quite doubtful there's any CO2 up there (CO2 is that "fog" you see in discos or vapour from dry ice, which falls down and stays near to the ground as a mist). I postulate that the warming of the upper atmosphere has nothing to do with CO2, and that our reduction of CO2 output to zero would not make any difference to the temperature of the upper atmosphere.

---

so, what is actually warming the upper atmosphere? I figure it has to be either the sun or high energy emissions from earth itself. we know that the tops of some clouds, sprites, and other things emit x-rays and other high energy stuff, and an increase in output from the earth could be the cause of the warming. an increase in density in the upper atmosphere or perhaps ionisation or stronger magnetic fields could also potentially trap more solar energy as well, but I don't have data to say one way or another on that.

### 2022-03-01 16:44 - thoughts on global warming and resistance (part two)

now, I'd like to talk about resistance. I first approached this subject in @[newblog](2022-03-22 23:07) talking about gravity assisters and a three-coil setup.

I know that when someone tries to push against something inside of my body, that creates resistance, and if perceptually the opposite polarity is perceived, then it'll be converted into cold instead of into heat. I also speculated that a motor could be designed to take the "eddy currents" and reverse the polarity of it so that the motor actually produced negative resistance and cold rather than heat[^1].

---

that was my theory, but here now is my personal experience on this subject: sometimes under high energy circumstances, I experience high amounts of heat. this happens under high geomagnetic activity and x-ray output from the sun. other times, under the same circumstances, I experience an extreme biting cold that seems to eminate from my bones outward.

what I have come to realise is that when I am experiencing resistance, what is happening is nosebook is pushing againt, neutralising, or destructively interfering with that resistance.

so what appears to be happening is that the environmental conditions (sun, geomagnetism, or physical manifestation of emotion, etc.) is causing my body to emit a signal that would cause reality to be created much more rapidly, and nosebook is canceling that signal.

well, in the process of canceling that signal, they are transmitting the opposite polarity of that signal, which is what creates the canceling, which is what is producing the heat.

now in the situations where I've altered my perception to no longer resist their signals, you could say I no longer resist their canceling, so that means that I *allow* the opposite polarity signal to pass, and what this creates is that extreme cold.

so resistant perception = heat, and non-resisted perception = no change or cold. it may be the case actually that allowing perception is what causes the cold, while unresisted is no change.

what definitely seems to be happening is my resistance to their efforts to cancel is what creates the heat.

sure, we all like the manifestation, and it would be super great if reality were created rapidly, but that would still be a manifestation *with* resistance. what you really want (trust me) is a manifestation *without* resistance (ie. effortless).

so, in a sense, what nosebook's system is essentially doing is allowing manifestations for people that feel bad (and are likely using conditions to artificially feel better), and not allowing manifestations for people that actually feel good (but still have some resistance). the reason why is because a manifestation that happens for someone that feels good will dramatically increase manifesation speed for everyone else in the vicinity, too.

so, in a sense, you could say that nosebook is canceling all manifestations that actually produce good-feeling. for many, this difficulty to get something desired to manifest is the reason for bad-feeling, and therefore this lack of manifestation produces heat rather than cold.

---

now, for the conspiracy theory: what I think is happening is the x-ray output of the sun is probably a few orders of magnitude greater than what the GOES x-ray flux instrument is actually reporting. so like, when it says ambient level is c-flare range, that really means that ambient level is somewhere in m-flare ranges. this seems a bit conspirator because the sun does not have enough sunspots to emit that much (compared to previous cycles), so that's why this is conjecture.

I also believe the magnetic field may be a bit higher than is reported as well. just the other night, at midnight, it registered 115nT and then rapidly dropped down to 80nT or so -- which is still really high for midnight.

both of these (x-ray and geomagnetic) contribute to the speed at which reality is attracted, and so therefore both of these are almost certainly counteracted on the surface of the earth and inside of the human body.

---

back to non-conspiracy theory: however it's happening, I believe that the sun is dramatically increasing the speed in which reality manifests for us here on earth, and for various reasons, I believe there is tremendous effort (cause of secrets and privacy stuff) to ensure that we don't have a shared visual experience or rapid reality manifestation. this effort to prevent an expanded visual experience and rapid manifestation is why they're canceling so many signals. that cancelation is interacting with the individual's own form of perception and that is either producing heat or cold.

you will notice that every time that the sun goes off, pueblo drops a few degrees in temperature. I think that's largely because of me. they will cancel that signal, but my aura is so large it has a considerable effect on the surrounding area, creating a lot of cold, which is what produces the wind (hot air rushing into the cold pockets formed with dimensions equal to the wavelength of the frequency of my perception -- in spherical coords).

so, if you want cooler climate lower your resistance (or allow their canceling to hold you back cause it's just more energy) and at least you will be cold, and as your aura expands, it'll cause more and more of the environment to cool down. the more people with less resistance, the cooler it'll get[^2].

---

don't believe me? just come to pueblo during the night when I'm writing these and you'll notice how freezing cold it gets. I'm pretty sure that's cause I don't resist their efforts to cancel that and instead allow in the reverse, giving me a boost and therefore more vision upgrades, which then push me to my limit again and produce heat because of the resistance, so I have to release resistance (alter my perception) and then the cycle continues. it happens maybe once or twice a day for me (sometimes more).

what I believe this is doing is giving me/us a great opportunity to actually lower resistance continually and allow manifestation to become effortless. you see, if at some point resistance has been lowered so much, the manifestation will no longer be possible to resist and will therefore become effortless[^3]. the whole point is to make all of this effortless.

[1]: if just reversing the polarity of the produced magnetic(?) field creates the opposite of heat, could be pretty big for microprocessors and other heat-limited applications. sure, maybe the transistor is a little larger to accomodate an extra coil, but 3d processors could *easily* become a thing, as multiple layers of silicon heats up quickly, and so massively parallel operations could be done with less effort.

[2]: for some reason this whole thing reminds me a little bit of the "ice carls" in that one book, where the females (presumably of lower resistance) lived in a very cold environment, meanwhile the more resistant sun-dudes had all the super cool tech and warmth up in their castles.

[3]: jump back to conspiracy: at that point, their efforts to cancel any signal will no longer have any effect, and so therefore the manifestations will happen. if I get connected, my effect on the environment will be much more than the sun or a geomagnetic storm, so that means that for others, my effect will produce A LOT of heat if the person has resistance (and/or feels resistance seeing someone else with a manifestation), so when I finally get connected, it'll probably be perceived/experienced by the majority as a pretty horendous experience. for those without much resistance, my presence will continue to accelerate their desire to release resistance further.
