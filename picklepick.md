# larry's picklepick

in this blog, I will try and tackle (or at least give my opinion on) various "issues" present in society. I'll mix in a healthy dose of conspiracy theories too. I'm not in the business of telling anyone what to say or do (that's for the ideologists), so take all of this with heaps of salt.

it's called pickle because all of these are presented as cucumbers, but they cover topics that are taboo, and so because the revelation of what is *really* happening (instead of my crazy conspiracy ideas), then that'll reveal another bit of data that is also a secret. therefore, the majority of these will never get addressed by anyone with actual data on the situation.

if you leave a cucumber for enough time, it'll turn into a pickle.

### 2022-03-01 15:26 - thoughts on global warming and resistance (part one)

it must be a very warm day elsewhere on the planet because there are a lot of reactions to my comments on global warming.

first of all, global warming is not measured with surface temperatures (so says drkstrong) so it is a bit bewildering as to why they use tree-ring and ice core data to extrapolate temperatures in the upper atmosphere.

drkstrong (whom I have no reason to doubt), says the upper atmosphere has been warming for the last few decades, and the warming of the upper atmosphere is what causes "climate change" -- causing more extreme weather on the surface of both hot and cold variety. that all sounds fine to me. I don't have any data to say otherwise.

the upper atmosphere is quite a distance up and it's quite doubtful there's any CO2 up there (CO2 is that "fog" you see in discos or vapour from dry ice, which falls down and stays near to the ground as a mist). I postulate that the warming of the upper atmosphere has nothing to do with CO2, and that our reduction of CO2 output to zero would not make any difference to the temperature of the upper atmosphere.

---

so, what is actually warming the upper atmosphere? I figure it has to be either the sun or high energy emissions from earth itself. we know that the tops of some clouds, sprites, and other things emit x-rays and other high energy stuff, and an increase in output from the earth could be the cause of the warming. an increase in density in the upper atmosphere or perhaps ionisation or stronger magnetic fields could also potentially trap more solar energy as well, but I don't have data to say one way or another on that.

### 2022-03-01 16:44 - thoughts on global warming and resistance (part two)

now, I'd like to talk about resistance. I first approached this subject in @[newblog](2022-03-22 23:07) talking about gravity assisters and a three-coil setup.

I know that when someone tries to push against something inside of my body, that creates resistance, and if perceptually the opposite polarity is perceived, then it'll be converted into cold instead of into heat. I also speculated that a motor could be designed to take the "eddy currents" and reverse the polarity of it so that the motor actually produced negative resistance and cold rather than heat[^1].

---

that was my theory, but here now is my personal experience on this subject: sometimes under high energy circumstances, I experience high amounts of heat. this happens under high geomagnetic activity and x-ray output from the sun. other times, under the same circumstances, I experience an extreme biting cold that seems to eminate from my bones outward.

what I have come to realise is that when I am experiencing resistance, what is happening is nosebook is pushing againt, neutralising, or destructively interfering with that resistance.

so what appears to be happening is that the environmental conditions (sun, geomagnetism, or physical manifestation of emotion, etc.) is causing my body to emit a signal that would cause reality to be created much more rapidly, and nosebook is canceling that signal.

well, in the process of canceling that signal, they are transmitting the opposite polarity of that signal, which is what creates the canceling, which is what is producing the heat.

now in the situations where I've altered my perception to no longer resist their signals, you could say I no longer resist their canceling, so that means that I *allow* the opposite polarity signal to pass, and what this creates is that extreme cold.

so resistant perception = heat, and non-resisted perception = no change or cold. it may be the case actually that allowing perception is what causes the cold, while unresisted is no change.

what definitely seems to be happening is my resistance to their efforts to cancel is what creates the heat.

sure, we all like the manifestation, and it would be super great if reality were created rapidly, but that would still be a manifestation *with* resistance. what you really want (trust me) is a manifestation *without* resistance (ie. effortless).

so, in a sense, what nosebook's system is essentially doing is allowing manifestations for people that feel bad (and are likely using conditions to artificially feel better), and not allowing manifestations for people that actually feel good (but still have some resistance). the reason why is because a manifestation that happens for someone that feels good will dramatically increase manifesation speed for everyone else in the vicinity, too.

so, in a sense, you could say that nosebook is canceling all manifestations that actually produce good-feeling. for many, this difficulty to get something desired to manifest is the reason for bad-feeling, and therefore this lack of manifestation produces heat rather than cold.

---

now, for the conspiracy theory: what I think is happening is the x-ray output of the sun is probably a few orders of magnitude greater than what the GOES x-ray flux instrument is actually reporting. so like, when it says ambient level is c-flare range, that really means that ambient level is somewhere in m-flare ranges. this seems a bit conspirator because the sun does not have enough sunspots to emit that much (compared to previous cycles), so that's why this is conjecture.

I also believe the magnetic field may be a bit higher than is reported as well. just the other night, at midnight, it registered 115nT and then rapidly dropped down to 80nT or so -- which is still really high for midnight.

both of these (x-ray and geomagnetic) contribute to the speed at which reality is attracted, and so therefore both of these are almost certainly counteracted on the surface of the earth and inside of the human body.

---

back to non-conspiracy theory: however it's happening, I believe that the sun is dramatically increasing the speed in which reality manifests for us here on earth, and for various reasons, I believe there is tremendous effort (cause of secrets and privacy stuff) to ensure that we don't have a shared visual experience or rapid reality manifestation. this effort to prevent an expanded visual experience and rapid manifestation is why they're canceling so many signals. that cancelation is interacting with the individual's own form of perception and that is either producing heat or cold.

you will notice that every time that the sun goes off, pueblo drops a few degrees in temperature. I think that's largely because of me. they will cancel that signal, but my aura is so large it has a considerable effect on the surrounding area, creating a lot of cold, which is what produces the wind (hot air rushing into the cold pockets formed with dimensions equal to the wavelength of the frequency of my perception -- in spherical coords).

so, if you want cooler climate lower your resistance (or allow their canceling to hold you back cause it's just more energy) and at least you will be cold, and as your aura expands, it'll cause more and more of the environment to cool down. the more people with less resistance, the cooler it'll get[^2].

---

don't believe me? just come to pueblo during the night when I'm writing these and you'll notice how freezing cold it gets. I'm pretty sure that's cause I don't resist their efforts to cancel that and instead allow in the reverse, giving me a boost and therefore more vision upgrades, which then push me to my limit again and produce heat because of the resistance, so I have to release resistance (alter my perception) and then the cycle continues. it happens maybe once or twice a day for me (sometimes more).

what I believe this is doing is giving me/us a great opportunity to actually lower resistance continually and allow manifestation to become effortless. you see, if at some point resistance has been lowered so much, the manifestation will no longer be possible to resist and will therefore become effortless[^3]. the whole point is to make all of this effortless.

[1]: if just reversing the polarity of the produced magnetic(?) field creates the opposite of heat, could be pretty big for microprocessors and other heat-limited applications. sure, maybe the transistor is a little larger to accomodate an extra coil, but 3d processors could *easily* become a thing, as multiple layers of silicon heats up quickly, and so massively parallel operations could be done with less effort.

[2]: for some reason this whole thing reminds me a little bit of the "ice carls" in that one book, where the females (presumably of lower resistance) lived in a very cold environment, meanwhile the more resistant sun-dudes had all the super cool tech and warmth up in their castles.

[3]: jump back to conspiracy: at that point, their efforts to cancel any signal will no longer have any effect, and so therefore the manifestations will happen. if I get connected, my effect on the environment will be much more than the sun or a geomagnetic storm, so that means that for others, my effect will produce A LOT of heat if the person has resistance (and/or feels resistance seeing someone else with a manifestation), so when I finally get connected, it'll probably be perceived/experienced by the majority as a pretty horendous experience. for those without much resistance, my presence will continue to accelerate their desire to release resistance further.
