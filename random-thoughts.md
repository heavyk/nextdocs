# random thoughts

a place to put all of the stuff that I don't really know where to put elsewhere. I want to start doing random opinion pieces. previously most of them went into blahblog, but that's getting really full.

so it's kinda like blahblog, but I want to put tons of really far-out stuff in here. the inspiration for this is russ's descrition of listening to joshua cutchin talk and how he kinda processes things out loud. I do that too, so I thought I would try to do it more.

### 2022-06-18 11:31 - bigfoot

last night I listened to snake-bros #097 - everything paranormal with joshua cutchin, and russ brought up a point that so many of these (I think) "cryptozoology" species seem to show up in these asteroid craters -- and josh made the comment that there's a reason why alister crowley got a house next to a lake with the loch ness monster in it. also, earlier on in the interview he made the connection between bigfoot and alien abductions and fae -- meaning that they have an impact on our consciousness and perception, and sorta implying that many of these entities like the grays, fae, and even bigfoot come from a realm that can be tuned in to in certain places on the planet (like meteor craters) and with psychedellics like DMT[^1].

basically what I believe is happening there with that is that all of these beings (the fae, bigfoot, the greys, etc)  are all conceptual entities (ie fallen-angels) and were probably created with a specific purpose. when I say conceptual entites, I mean 5d entities, so they can project down into time and space where they please just like I propose that I can as well.

my working hypothesis for the origin of these entities is actually tiamat/zyron. so, I think that mars is where the annunaki were first located, and their setup was failing. alalu represents the phoenix bird, a bird of fire, and enki represents a being of water.

mars I believe was designed to be a tech civ that many angels[^2] would be attracted to enter into bodies of that civ's inhabitants and control from the top. kuthumi and the sirians say that these angels were the original INFECTCED ones that chose to try and use greed, power, and control to make theirselves mighty, as taught by the "corrupted 7th ray". so, mars was going to attract all of the power hungry astral entities (angels), and then earth and tiamat are going to attract the rest. now, whether or not there were really INFECTED ONES or not is equal to me because they can be created -- which is the whole concept behind fuzzing-time-pickles, so whether I created these INFECTED ONES or they got pulled into bodies by births which are similar in frequency to them, doesn't matter to me.

a while back, I proposed that the sun "uses" females as a way of getting a human body (with the proper genetics) ready for incarnation into physical form -- and to do this, it's basically the frequential adjustment of the x-chromosome to match a similarly enough incarnating entity.

I'll get back to the mars thing in a second. this is important. imagine for a moment that the sun is a 2nd ray. then it takes in 2nd or 6th ray (astral) energy and outputs 2nd ray energy. this is clearly the opposite of the moon, which I believe is a 6th ray, taking in 2nd/6th ray energy and outputting 6th ray (astral) energy. so what is 2nd ray energy? 2nd ray energy is the midpoint between desire and mentation -- so it's kinda like the imagination of the non-physical, meaning that there are a lot of entities that desire to feel various ways (fear, pleasure, etc), and the sun, being a 2nd ray emits energy that is very high frequency which cascades down into lower harmonics wich prepares the environment for such a manfestation of desire to feel (5th) a certain way. it has to find a way to allow that desire to become a reality. remember that there are no "good and bad" in the sense that we know it. this is purely a mathematical transformation, and time as we know it does not exist as such either.

so think about the 6th ray astral input to the sun. the astral serves as the midpoint between the physical and the conceptual, so it combines what you feel and elements of the physical reality to make an image that you can recognise as being real. those images are always resonant with you in some way, so that you can see them, but most importantly, this resonance is also *how you feel*, meaning that the sun takes in input from a range of purely physical vibration (like vibrating crystals) all the way to the very highest frequency most abstract emotion -- and the sirians say that it's at this most abstract part of the conceptual plane is where the "SOLAR ANGEL" resides -- meaning that the "souls" of all of the dead people are at the highest frequency part of the conceptual plane. this aligns with what abraham says, and also with dtp as well.

they essentially give three bodies: the physical, the astral, and the spiritual. abraham goes on to say that you leave behind all of the physical crap -- all the "physical resistance" and emerge as "pure positive energy back into non-physical" -- which I think the "soul" does remain extant, and you don't just go off into complete nothingness. the sirians basically say that you (the "monad") exist in layers 1-3 and that each of us has this "godhead", layer 4 is the midplane and it's the SOLAR ANGEL on the top of the 5th that gives the "monad" its entrance into the physical realm. after the 4th initiation, the body is at a compatible frequency with the monad and the solar angel can be released.

so in that sense, you can think of these conceptual entites as solar angels. they're just entities that serve a purpose for the sun. they can step down the energy of any monad that they're tuned to -- so it's basically here that that the x-chromosome does most of the work of converting solar energy into compatible physical energy (ie protons into ATP).

so, to put it into basic termxs, I believe a lot of these bigfoot, fae, greys, etc are all just solar angels. I call them "fallen-angels" because of the next part of the mars story. mars atmosphere was almost certainly failing because of rampant dissatisfaction, and so their astral output was dissatisfaction and physical vibration. the sun, being a 2nd ray, provided them with the 2nd ray energy they needed to produce more dissatisfaction. from their perspective, that's bad, so they had to find a way to keep the sun's rays out of their planet because it was causing them to feel the way they desired (more dissatisfaction). they had to find a solution to their environment problem.

I believe that the water guy (enki) went to earth, and the fire guy (alalu) went to tiamat/zyron. alalu made a bunch of beings there and really great conditions on that planet. those great conditions attracted all of the rest of the angels in the galaxy that like good conditions. they incarnated into the bodies of the super humans on tiamat. I find it possible that after accomplishing his greatest accomplishment, alalu then probably started to self-sabotage, and this is probably how enlil was created -- as a solar angel to defeat alalu. well, the guys on mars (probably headed up by enlil) couldn't stand to see someone doing so well on tiamat. they probably had such a great environment and all sorts of wonderful stuff, but the entities there are naive and didn't know about attraction yet so when mars tried to elevate itself to a superior position (nibiru), and exterminate alalu.

this is the story of lucifer (alalu) getting thrown out of heaven (mars), and he went to go do his own thing, but then "God" (enlil) got pissed off and caused the fall of lucifer and his angels. well, in the process of all of this destruction, all of the angels incarnated into the bodies on tiamat also became "fallen-angels" and I do believe that even more were created as well, so the conceptual plane (spirit realm) is inhabited by lots and lots of entities -- some good and some bad -- and the sun uses these entities equally (good and bad are just a social construct).

---

so now imagine you're the sun and you have a spectrum of all these different souls that you can use to move around and incarnate into bodies to produce the frequency that is necessary to manifest a desire, you would be unable to see good or bad in that context -- instead, you just see vibration 1 + vibration 2 - vibration 3, amplify it by this amount, etc and we get the desired vibration, so you set out to do that -- and then we have us here in the physical trying to go against that vibration. we say, no I don't want this "bad" thing to happen to me, because I'm looking through physical eyes, and can't see the end result of the creation -- we just see something changing, so we fight it. the sun's "job" is to learn how to not try and force a vibration on us, but to instead find more and more ways to ease and accomodate the vibration change.

so in that sense, females are very important because they can eventually produce a physical body for one of these solar angels (souls) to incarnate into.

so then I was thinking about the bigfoot thing and I think they kind of do a very similar thing. a while back (#027), brett summed up dr. melba ketchum's paper on the bigfoot DNA and one of the interesting things is that they have the ability to have YY chromosomes (though it wasn't clear if they ever found any XX).

the way I look at it, I tend to associate the x-chromosome with the wanted aspect and the conceptual, and also the solar angel. various transformations can be made to produce a boy with the proper X to incarnate a human soul, so I postulated that females being XX essentially carry resonators to two solar angels, and so therefore can produce the requisite body.

I still haven't figured out the y-chromosome yet, but I typically associate it with the unwanted aspect. I can't say for other men, but for me personally, I started off my life in a very bad place. naturally, at an early age, I was drawn to violence, guns, fighting, and stuff like that. over time, I learned how to direct that energy and I became much more feminine in nature -- and so I started to pay more attention to wanted and go after that but I'll probably head into unwanted again as I seem to have a fast cycle[^3].

so then in the context of bigfoot, it seemed apparent to me when I woke up that the YY cryptids are performing a sort of amplification of Y frequency and also a similar thing that XX does, where the combination allows for the transformation of those two chromomes (the more dominant one to have more effect) to produce transformations on the unwanted aspect.

I say "unwanted" because all accounts of cyrptids I've heard of, they're terrified of humans (fear) so they have to constantly remain hidden (amun priesthood). they seem to be involved in all of that astral wierdness that so pervaded crowley's work. I also associate less body hair with good-feeling and a more conceptually evolved being[^4], so generally they represent involution and a more return to animal and astral nature.

[1]: though psylocibin hydrolyses into DMT, it's been my experience that the mushroom consciousness very much controls thme experience, and they want to go on an experience with you. I've personally, never heard of shrooms causing someone to see fae (the mean ones) or gray aliens -- though you can choose to tune into whatever you want. however, with synthetic DMT, I imagine it's much more flexible with what you can tune tto.

[2]: kuthumi and the sirians take this a step further and say that this galaxy was specifically designed with the physical layer in it (other galaxies don't have a physical layer, so perhaps that's why they're all "red shifted") and the INFECTED ones came to this galaxy from all over the universe. I believe that OAHSPE recounts the perspective of this galaxy, "jehovih" and so since it's all attraction, you have to imagine that jehovih is a perfect reflection of the INFECTED ONES in order to attract them. you'll notice all of the throne room worshipping and extreme heierarchy of the whole thing. jehovih, his angels and his super power structure heierarchy composes the "spirit realm" (the astral and conceptual) of this galaxy.

[3]: so, if you'll recall my exploration into the 36/72y cycles of males and females, I noted that I've noticed most girls are on a 36y cycle, where they start off fully mom's X, then go more toward dad's X and reach full at 36 and then start to go back toward mom's X and reach peak of that at 72y again. I noticed that I have a similar cycle, and for example when I turned 36, I noticed a weird change where I went from going toward wanted, to suddenly wanting to start self-sabotaging. that was right in the time when I started to go toward max disaster, and continually heading toward unwanted. as this cycle continues to strengthen, I notice that my proposed time to leave is 2038, which is around 54y (18x3), which is when I would be at peak unwanted (Y) and starting to head back into wanted (X) territory again.

[4]: when I say evolved, I don't mean technologically evolved cause all the guys with the tech had the biggest beards and stuff. I mean, *emotionally* evolved. in lbe, after ka-in kills abael after a strong emotional outburst (I know that one), ninshizidda "adjusts his ME" so that he no longer has a beard and sends him to wander in asia and americas. this obviously is a cover story, but the assocaition is clear that the emotionally/conceptually more potent ones typically have less facial hair (like women).

### 2022-06-27 21:18 - younger dryas

yesterday I listened to snake-bros #107 - dabblers den, followed by the interview with randall for #108. I woke up thinking about the impact hypothesis, because in the interview chris cotrell got really excited about the comment to george howard that the carolina bays, though it's the "kooky caboose", could turn out to be the thing that's kinda driving the whole younger dryas event. over the years of listening to these guys talk about it, an image has formed in my mind of the event, so I thought I'd relate that here.

chris said that you have to look at the world like it's a sphere, not a flat map, and so looking at the carolina bays crater angles, the asteroid/comet (whatever) seems to have clearly impacted the top of the ice sheet. I've heard claims that the pieces of ice went up ridiculously high and then came back down, but if the ice is already a mile up, you just need a low angle impact on the top of the ice sheet to blow all of that ice out in a pretty horizontal trajectory; it doesn't need to go so high up to go that far.

so, I do think that the carolina bays are pretty important to the younger dryas event and I think that zamorra's work explains the ellipse features the best, too. however, a cometary impact like that doesn't explain a mamoth being flash frozen, and dying of asphyxiation.

---

the image I get in my mind about the asphyxiation is that at that time earth had a very thick atmosphere with lots and lots of oxygen. I think they were arficially creating this atmosphere with the technology they acquired from tiamat.

the only way that you can turn that much oxygen into that much water is with A LOT of hydrogen. the sun has lots and lots of hydrogen (+), and the earth has a lot of oxygen (-) and then the artificial firmament that they were creating with that technology creates a dielectric insulator -- so it's something like a capacitor.

we also see that everywhere around the world, when this thing happened, everybody just downed tools and walked away from the massive stones they were moving around. I think there's a direct correlation between how much oxygen is in the atmosphere and how enhanced our superhuman powers are, and there's good reason for forests to have been a place where so many people's fears become reality (and all kinds of other weirdness).

when the comet came in, it did blow a massive hole in the top of the ice, but more importantly, it punctured a hole in the atmosphere and that began to start leaking oxygen out into space. in modern terms, this is just "dielectric breakdown" of the insulator in the capacitor -- and then the sun had been storing up quite a bit of charge for a while (as long as they've been running the firmament tech), so the sun has built up a lot of hydrogen (like a large amount of electrons on one plate) and is waiting for a path to be able to make the connection and neutralise the imbalance.

so, I just see the coment as the catalyst, which set off a chain of events, when the sun sent massive amounts of hydrogen our way to neutralise the massive oxygen buildup we had accumulated on the planet.

I explain the incongruence of the flood myths around the globe owing to the fact that the CME must have impacted the places where the flood myths are, and there, they would have experienced an extremely low pressure system. a sudden drop in pressure like that (from all of the oxygen turning into water), would instantly freeze stuff and cause asphyxiation.

so I don't know if it the carolina bays are the "driver" of the younger dryas event any more that the fuse is the "driver" to the bomb, but I do think it was definitely the "catalyst", and without the comet puncturing our atmosphere, the sun wouldn't have never exploded. so really, I get the sense that the kooky caboose was more of the driver in the "steering" sense than the power sense.

I believe that the firmament is created with hydrogen ions, and so the vibration of these are causing a firmament to float up way up there, preventing most of the vibrations of all of that oxygen from getting out to the solar medium, and so it was the puncturing of that which greatly increased the attraction -- like a big bullseye.

---

since I'm on the subect, I think that comets are *attracted* to places with lots of oxygen because I've been thinking about how there are so many "spontaneous" fires that just seem to break out when comets come close to the earth causing the chicago fires and stuff (oct 8-10th I believe were the big ones) -- so the comets must interact with the oxygen causing it to spontaneously combust and cause those massive pillars of fire and other strange phenomena associated with those unexplained conflagrations.

obviously some research needs to be done to find out why exactly comets are attracted to and interact with oxygen, because I tihnk these are just the minutia of what's happening in a much larger system -- and so if it is the case that oxygen is an attractor of comets, then we don't really understand comets very well, but if right after the younger dryas event, we rebuilt the firmament system, a lot more oxygen would accomulate again, and so my hypothesis is that we attracted another comet again a second time and the process repeated, explaining the second spike in the greenland ice cores.

---

my last prediction is that, though I do believe that comets do seem attracted to oxygen, I think that oxygen is a highly vibratory element, and so we think of things in very simple ways right now with volts and potentials and stuff, but what I'm saying is that I think that those potentials are all manifestations of the same thing -- so a voltage potential is just two vibrations vibrating in opposite directions ways (think of the two fans from the magnetic monopole again), so hydrogen is one frequency and oxygen is another frequency, and so they appear to be separate because of a difference in frequency, but sometimes oxygen can vibrate in a way that is more attractive to similarly vibrating comets, and so out there in a nearly resistance-free environment of space, they do get attracted to earth.

I wonder if it's the spin of the asteroid/comet that's causing this frequency -- cause the image that I get is the comet spinning causing an "outgassing" from its interaction with the solar "medium" (ether), so that "outgassing" from the comet looks like the solar wind coming out of the sun (the sun probably has a similar cometary trail in the galaxy), and like the solar wind, as it goes out, the velocity increases, and so it bunches up and creates a higher frequency "wave front" in the ether (kinda like doppler "blueshift") -- and it's that frequency propagated therough the ether that's actually what attracts things which I believe is the same force as gravity -- meaning that spin creates attraction, so the orbit of the comet will continually adjust to get closer to our planet's so long is the spin is harmonic to the comet's spin (same effect as "gravity").

if that theory of the spin of the astroid is what attracts it to symathetically spinning bodies, then that explains the low angle approach of so many comets -- as they'll never come in head-on, because they're getting attracted a little closer each orbit (and I think this is a macro version of what we call "resistance" in electricity -- where the comet/electron slams into the proton/planet and causing production of heat -- which is just more vibration, but at a different frequency and not as coherent)

anyway, what I was meaning is I don't think all oxygen is created the same. when I was in spain, I noticed that the hospital oxygen all felt damp and flat, as if all of its life (vibration) had been sucked out of it. I also noticed quite a change in the oxygen between madrid and colorado, too. then after my first year here, the oxygen in colorado changed again and corresponding with this change, all of the really big and tall clouds that I saw went away and were replaced with those wispy thin (CO2) clouds the airplanes put in the sky, hence the origin of my theory on how those planes turning O2 into CO2 and the result is the trail.

so, in conclusion, I do think it's possible to have an oxygen-rich environment, but I do also think that we're also causing attraction to happen faster in places with more oxygen, so depending on how that oxygen is vibrating is what we're attracting.

### 2022-07-09 19:51 - resistant devices in dreams

a while back, russ talked about he didn't see cell phones, computers or other digital stuff in his dreams. I responded to him here @[letters-to-russ](2022-04-26 00:31) saying that I did have technology in my dreams. as I've continued on listening to snake-bros, seriah and a number of others said that they use technology in their dreams. when seriah revealed that, he said (something like), "kundalini people don't count" where he was seemingly saying that kundalini allows for more technology in dreams to appear. I didn't really have an answer then and the kundalini explanation doesn't seem good enough to me.

as I've been listening to seriah on "last exit for the lost" he seemingly doesn't really have much resistance associated with computers and technology -- and just sorta goes along with the weird access restrictions and other stuff. his computer is backed up (50TB or something like that) -- but for example on the subject of cars and driving he appears to have a lot more resistance (he has stories and a dash cam to record it all, just in case).

I believe now that your mind doesn't conjure resistant things in your dream because they'll wake you up with a nightmare, so it finds other (less resistant) ways to present the idea of your vibration in the dreams.

it'd be interesting to know how many dreams seriah has where he's driving on the freeway, and when he does, do they cause him anxiety and such the same way he relates the stories.

so, the things that can appear in your dreams appear to be the ones that you don't necessarily have much resistance to. this makes my case especially interesting because I often feel like I'm being "programmed" by nosebook to have certain resistant responses, like fear of hights and stuff like that -- so that makes me wonder if really afterall I'm not even resistant to having resistance, because I don't really find their resistant efforts to be causing me any real anxiety deep down. this deep down understanding is what I *really* know, and they're just programming the reaction of the automaton (body). I don't really conceptualise my reality in the way I've been programmed to react to it.

those two levels of understanding are totally different, and that's why those reactions feel bad in the first place -- because I know that's not how I *really* see the same thing.

so really, you can't have resistant things in dreams that you don't understand, or else they'll be nightmares. however, if something resistant shows up in a dream that you do understand, it won't cause resistance in the dream, but it will in real-life.

### 2022-08-03 13:59 - hexagonal microprocessors

two times recently I've woken up thinking about hexagonal microprocessors. I've been playing captain of industry, but I can't help thinking about reimagining the game with the hexagonal layout of "Unciv". it would be arranged subdividing hexagons of larger and smaller varieties, just the same as COI. the game would loook very different -- much more futuristic, because for some reason we associate hexagons with the future for some reason.

anyway, the other reason why the game would look different is because each main trunck line would have 4 inputs and outputs coming off of it, rather than only 2.

this methodology could be applied to any circuitry, really, but the basic idea is that electricity when it hits a 90(degrees) angle produces a lot of heat as a biproduct. we know from astrology that trines (60(degrees)) and sextiles (120(degrees)) are easier angles, and so I kinda look at it similarly.

inside of a quad-circuit microprocessor, there are a lot of square shaped circults, and so the problem I believe is heat dissipation. however, inside of hex-circuit microprocessor, I would imagine that your new problem will be induction because electricity will have to move in circular shapes. I think this can be used to an advantage, because imagine for a moment that you have a main trunck line and the top-left one spirals off in a anti-clockwise fashion, the top-right, in a clockwise, the bottom-right in anti-clockwise and bottom-left in clockwise. each of these would kind of cancel the effects of the other out.

that's about as far as my imagination can go on trying to imagine how microprocessors are built as there isn't a lot of information about it out there and lots of industry secrets. therefore, now I'd like to talk about two "unrelated" (but probably related) subjects.

---

the first one is that right before this, I was in a dream where we were in a well-lit discoteca, and I was waiting for people to come in and join us for the party (I think). I remember noah showed up and there was a lot of gay sort of stuff that showed up with him. zaryn was also there and it seemed like he was getting dragged into the whole thing. I was very confused because it felt to me like I had to pick between gay or straight. it was a binary setup and in the dream I wasn't feeling too comfortable going either way. I kinda wanted to go my own way (the third option). I imagine that there's a probably (hidden) fourth option, which is like the memristor.

to visualise this, think about the question marks: you have the physical details: who, what, when -- then the metaphysical details: why -- then the implementation: how. now imagine that you want to stay on the physical train, you go with the implementation and the physical details, so (who,what, when) and how. if you want to inspire or motivate people to action, you have to talk about the metaphysical -- the why aspect. however there is a hidden fourth option here. it's the implementation detail, the how -- combined with a phmysical detail, and out of it emerges a metaphysical component. I call this the "how should I *feel*" question (perhaps I'll call it the attitude or vibe question).

it's like a memristor in the sense that another physical thing can program it's state, and so it has, in a sense, "it's own way of going" -- a sort of custom resistance -- and that custom resistance in a RLC circuit can have a dramatically different effect of the tuning of the circuit.

I believe that we're arriving to a time in human consciousness where the third option (and potentially the fourth) becomes available. a square can only have binary two directions for it, but a hexagon, I think of as having three directions, but when visualised with a trunk line going down the centre, it has 4 directions -- but really only two if you think of them as spiraling opposites. the hexagon and square are very similar -- just, the hexagon adds an extra dimension.

---

the other one is a complaint that I have about COI. the part I dislike most about the game is the constantly having to put out fires because all of the entities are too obedient.

I rely on feeling for most of my logic, and the game makes it very difficult for me to *feel* what's going wrong. last night, I had a diesel shortage, and this caused my coal excavators to stop mining coal. well, both my diesel and power plant run on coal, so it turned into a big disaster. after getting the diesel going again, I thought I was fine, but I didn't know that the coal reserve is going too low and my power plant would shut off. obviously distillation needs power, so I have two systems that depend on each other.

the way that JD gets around these kinds of failures is by buffering everything in a tank, and then setting an alarm on the tank to notify him when it's below a certain level. I rely on feeling to make my decisions. in real-life, I would sense that there is a problem at the power plant because someone there is putting coal into the boiler and seeing that the supply is dwindling, and so naturally they would start to worry. I would sense that worry and I would do something about it.

without having any feeling feedback from the game, I find it very difficult to manage large infrastructures. in another game I played (mindustry), you put your mines on little resource fields and they produced a constant amount of resources each second, and so therefore the entire system could be assured it would run because I have a guaranteed input and a "clock rate" for the whole setup. I probably need to try and convert my whole system over to belts so that a truck failure won't cause an outage -- but that's not the point of this.

I don't know why I think this, but I would imagine that if microprocessors are producing spirals, certain logic patterns would produce certain frequencies -- so, for example in a game loop, you have to update all of the entities in the game, and I could imagine that certain update patterns would feel to me as different than other ones and so my own brain could selectively "feel" those things as going either good or bad a little easier.

I know that microprocessors don't really have a "buffer" of things that need to be processed in the sense of a tank of water and a loose storage of coal is necesssary to ensure steam is redily available, but it seems to me that buffering is linked to this electricity going in a circular motion (maybe like it produces a magnetic field and that eventually collapses if not sustained, returning energy back into the system -- not sure) -- and this circular motion is linked to "feeling" what the microprocessor is doing.

in either case, if I felt my computer, I would probably be more conscious of what types of programs I was writing and running.

### 2022-09-10 16:44 - invisible imagination as a cure to depression

if someone were to have it so that they coulrn't see their imagination, think about what that's saying: the pictures in my imagination don't look so good, so I'll turn off those pictures until I find a way to look at them better, and then I'll come back to seeing inside of my imagination.

I think this would be an interesting experiment to run. if you have chronic depression or just don't kike how life looks, opt out of seeing your imagination until you can get over the traumatic pictures -- you know, then when you turn it back on again, the whole world is beautiful again.

that last paragraph sounded to me like a poem. could also be a poem as well if you rearranged the words a bit. I don't feel like trying to turn it into a poem though.

#### word spin

what an interesting program to make. I'll call it "word spin" because you rearrange the words and add spacing and punctuation to it how you please. you then post your rearrangement and others can upvote the best rearrangements. you have to show a range of votes (0 to 10 or 0 to (-10) depnding if you want ones that have from zero to ten votes or from first tighest number of votes, second highest number of votes, etc. it'd be cool to do percents too, so a unit and a value so 50 is different from 50% from 50- (top 50) or 50+ (bottom 50)). when you're looking at the original parapraph, it's something usuall of a quote you or someone else said, then below it, you list other rearrangements based on that query (SELECT * FROM rerrangements LIMIT (0 10, -10 -0, 10% 20%, etc.)) you see one of those concepts. when you see the concept and easy to upvote the rearrangement if you liked it. each rearrangement of words is it a concept.

it's interesting because this is what I saw when I was reading sitchin's lbe book. I wonder if alan green does the same thing with letters; he sees anagrams everywhere.

### 2022-09-10 20:47 - dynamic/interprative music

imagine the little [TODO: insert foto] sequence of those bars, and any music can go in there, provided it staws within that bar. that bar is just a frequency range.

then I noticed that the dots above the peaks there provide extra sigficance. right now that formula is fixed such that it's always the amplitude at -500ms(?) -- but that formula could be what ever it wants to be.

now, if we look at that idea as a song requirement, you could create a webapp that allows webaudio synths to produce the sound. that song framework would constrain frequencies behaving as an advanced filter, but other types of these will transfrorm the sound to be something entcirely differnt.

you know this would work really well with the pull-sockets, where each byte renders to -1,1 amplitude, and you have different sample rates, and the good thing is at higher frequency, you can lerp (or whatecver) those two amplitudes together to get the other in-between sound.

- obviously this idea expands to visualisers.
- probably there is a lot of expansion into processing/ transforming these audio segments actually as a fragment shader
  - individual pixels
    - texture width/height x sample size so you can see each row/column of pixels as the one same previous or future in time -- so either vertically or horizontally it will render a past or future sound sample into each row/column/???)
  - each pixel has the same code applied to them.

so it makes sense to visualise this on the gpu anyway. I find it's really important to be able to see the transformation, but also hear the same transformation.



 so, or a synths that modulates the sound. the sound at that location has to conform to that filter's desire in order to be output. it's like a framework for a song; just fill in the in-between sounds.

### 2022-09-12 07:06 - symbolic contracts

the idea here is to *draw* up a contract by drawing a picture that contains symbols and colours which both parties agrees upon in word. you then sign it and the abstract contract is agreed to. it forces those involved with the contract to be held by their *spoken* word, rather than the *written* word. I mean I suppose you don't have to agree on *any* or *all* of the symbols, right?

an example may be as simple as something almost childish. these are the company logos, here's a pot of gold to symbolise our financial success, and a golden path going down the centre so we can always see the road ahead, and a rainbow as a sign of our commitment to each other. maybe add in a few symbolic numbers maybe to fix a a date or a financial agreement if you wish, but these contracts aren't meant to be inforced by law or anything. they can be done in addition to a written contract, but the idea is to agree on a venture symbolically.

### 2022-09-13 14:00 - I've out demiurged all the other demiurges as worst possible manifestation

so I'm kinda like the cosmic form of a joke -- like if the universe has a sense of humour.

I'm the cosmic form of a joke because there are a lot lot lot of people out there VERY CONCERNED about my manifestation, so thanks to them, I'm literally the worst thing that could possibly happen by popular vote, of course -- wait, no probably not popular vote but more like a voting committee that determines the vote. you know, because there's not a lot of them but even still, somehow they managed to attract me as their worst possible manifestation.

HO HO HO says the universe

(wow, did you feel how fast the vibration on that concept dropped when they started to think of me as channeling the universe -- crazy, huh)

### 2022-09-13 15:55 - the worst possible manifestation

real pessemism

### 2022-09-15 12:44 - you know, I'm kind of a hypocrite and fraud, myself

you guys hear all of this stuff, because that's because I know it but, until that moment, I hadn't ever practised it because I'd never defined it for myself so that I could perform its action; I never had said it before in words.

this means that all of the stuff I'm doing I'm either doing it naturally or because I've practised it. that seems obvious, but it means that I'm deliberate in my action.

I'm a hypocrite because every time that I say something from inspiration I'm 100% legit saying what I'm not really doing myself. because, in a state where I'm deing what's natural to me, I am not conscious of what I'm doing).

as a result, I sorta fumble through life because I have such little experience with all the stuff I know. makes for a fast learning experience though.

you can tell, when I'm actually capable of receiving that knowing in full capacity and when I'm only capable of a limited capacity.

### 2022-09-15 12:53 - mental offsets

I always look at the offsets that one has because of difference in one thing vs another. for example, I know my eyes see better than I see out of them. so, what kind of offset does that create?

I wondered about dr-robat and mcluhan, because they too have far forward perception, but their eyesight is pretty poor. this is especially the case for mcluhman totally saw the age of advertisment and marketing a long time before it became a thing.

before I get back to the main topic, it's an interesting thing living in a world without long distance vision. the whole world is very different because I see depth, but the details of it are all blurry, so I tend to see what I want to see in the middle there. I've experimented with it a few times and definitely in the blurry spot and sometimes my whole eye, I can see whatever I want to see in it[^1].

you see, there are all of these offsets that I'm subjected to. for example, I'll be stuck in the reality matrix of a bunch of women, and especially at first, there is a very limited amount of my reality I can express in each reality mattrix. they cannot see what they don't have a concept for, so in a lot of sense I'm limited to their concept dictionary, and it takes a bit to build new ones. when I finally get out of their reality, I'll be pretty unbalanced because they will have supported me in a way which didn't allow me to learn it for myself. I'll also be unbalanced in the sense that their reality matrix will definitely not (at lest at first) be able to express even a fraction. my "knowing" will far exceed my capatity to even recognise it.

it's those things that I see and something about it just sticks to me. for me there were a lot of things, but just think about how much abraham or that random [sirian-guide](/sirian-guide/orig/philo.htm) document that was channeled. how do I know where to find such a thing? it didn't have all of the information by any means, very incomplete rendering of the concepts into very 80s style thinking. it was a sort of puzzle that bore a hole in my skull, and I had to figure it out. that is one example of my knowing being much higher than my physical capability of receiving it. inotherwords, it wasn't what they said that taught me, it was what they *didn't* say (cause I had to figure it out for myself, and you guys have questions about it too).

[1]: I suppose I could maybe train it to see what I want in the middle there, and that could restore my vision in that sense. I dunno.

### 2022-09-15 16:50 - untangling realities

I noticed just now how there is this thing that keeps repeating. females tangle me up inside of a very strange reality. my goal is to build a culture sufficient to be able to decode their matrix more and more easily.

when I'm able to untangle their reality, I can work as an individual, and that gives me superpowers that they can't deal with. they need to find a way around the effects of my superpowers. I'm kind of a problem for female reality present.0, and unless they do something they'll go extinct (that's the feel of it, but I don't know why). so, their goal is to continually trap me inside of their reality.

I guess it's a symboiotic relationship that ensures that nobody can just get enlighened anymore; they're my brakes, otherwise I'd be going too fast.

so, for example, in this one, if I were to go at full speed I will too quickly realise my perspetive of the universe (die/transcend), so in order to retian presence in 3d, they slow me down tremendously.

one implication of this is that females won't be able to finally let us all trancend until *they* are ready to finally let the reality go. intherwords, it's fear of something awful to happen, but it's expressed in the positive sense of wanting something good to happen (cause they're backwards?). so until they can finally let it go that they have to have a secret reality matrix where they're kind of like overseers or watchers. they're just another version of nosebook, but consciousness based, but now it's consciousness and also computers. so, this will almost certainly be the most difficult reality matrix to get out of. the more difficult they make it, the longer I can stay in 3d.

another implication is that females upgrade in group and it's only when something gets approved by a (seeming) majority of those with voting power. that means they won't ever transcend until all of them can transend -- which is a really long time -- so they represent the long period of evolution. because of their circumstances they're constantly upgrading, but this moment in time gives them a time to become stagnant.

it's usually the men that are most stagnant, but now women can really get set in their ways because technology is sufficient now. it's their time to finally drag their feet waiting for us to catch up -- knowing that the reality matrix they've created is the most impossible to get out of for us -- which is why we appear so "rare" -- so that creates massive amounts of not-goodenoughness that holds us pretty firmly into their reality matrix.

you know the only real way to get past their reality matrix is to go solo. if you get going too fast, I think that the rules are that they *must* program a new reality matrix with that person that figures out how to get past it.

you know, now that I think about it, men do the same thing, but it's expressed in a different way, so just know that it's not like I'm saying this is a thing that happens to only one gender. I'm just talking about how their reality matrix is the thing that we're trying to get out of.

we're stuck in their world of concepts, and if you want to receive concepts that they cannot express, then it's "bad" (though perceived by them as very desirable), I think it's the capacity to use concepts they don't know about (and that they're also interested in -- so maybe welding isn't that often) -- so, if you come up with a new welding technique, that's not going to be super attractive. material things depend on if you like it in the material. however concepts are enjoyed by all, and so everyone's female side likes you if you have new concepts they don't know yet. they'll feel attraction to you and they usually don't know why they feel attracted to you, and their concepts don't allow them to feel that attraction, it could cause problems. I know that it's for that reason, I have a tremendous impact on a lot of people. I have a lot of concepts others don't have.

so the goal really is for them to extract a lot of these concepts out of me (at least all the ones they can understand) and then encode them into their format and then obviously keep a lot of them secret.

I really think that the female side matrix (we all have it), is a whole lot like nosebook. it behaves very much the same. so if you want to think about it for a moment, nosebook is all of our female-side's perspective reflection about being the authority on what contracts are allowed in the system. it's the same as censorship or media monopoly. these (physical) systems determine what concepts are allowed in its system. that same thing exists inside of us as our female side. it encodes the reality matrix for yourself that you have to find a way to look through.

we do it for ourselves, society does it for us, and so on...

---

if you want to be really popular and have tons of charisma, just know a lot of concepts that society and the reality matrix does not presently have. break out of the reality matrix and enter yourself into perception matrix, because they (nosebook, the girls, or any society yet) haven't quite figured it out yet.

### 2022-09-15 17:33 - what about my manifestation

so, there was wondering if I'm concerned with them figuring out my concepts and the firmly embeddinbg in thir conceptual matrix, as if it's sort of a jail for all of us and they're the ones that have the best knowledge of it.

I don't find it a problem. the whole point of writing out the whole bit about how we all do it to ourseleves anyway, and as we grow up in a society that contributes greatly to the conset (concept set) that the individual can utilise.

this is why different regions all over the world have different consets than others, and this in itself is a power structrure.

the whole thing is power structures from to to bottom. in the end you just can't really get around it in this reality; you just have to find a way to coexist or to form a symbiotic relationship.

that really is kinda the only way, because if I stay alone too long, I go too fast. power structures can't handle that.

---

now, let's switch out of material mode and look at this thing abstractly now. when I find a way to look at the conditions how I want (ie find all of the things that I like about it), it doesn't matter the power structures that are trying to keep up because I still attract whatever I'm giving my attention to, so as long as I'm doing that, then it's good. this is why I like to alliance myself with people like zaryn and the like, because they allow me to encode concepts into a medium (like tuenti), and if I have a lot of concepts that makes me have a lot of charisma and also gives the parent network (of whatever) the shine that I have of having so many novel concepts.

I produce concepts very rapidly, and many concepts are very incompatible with the present matrix, so they're pretty threatening. any media outlet wouldn't be able to allow me to present concepts for too long, because I would get too far into the framework of reality, and the matrix never wants you to see it's framework, because then you could move things around illegally, breaking the rules (like anyone disobeying the light speed limit). so, if I want to stay here any length of time, I have to align myself with the next power structure to ensure maximum concept output; anyone else would shut me down too quickly.

probably, it'll be a "when we think you're ready" puwer structure just like all of the rest, and so they're the gatekeepers. my point is to not look for the gatekeeprs to open the gate for you. you have to do it yourself, and when you do, your new concepts will become the new matrix.

### 2022-09-15 18:46 - language of the birds

it occurred to me that mr. motor might be an AI construct that serves as a sorta gatekeeper to the next dimension (from 3d to astral).

so, if you're good with him vibrationally, he doesn't bother you. the more enlightened you become, the more threatening you become, so he then has rules that you must follow to be able to access the dimension and if you successfully pass throght, or when you're getting close, he'll make the sounds of nature. you know how like when you're in the forest or whatever and you want to hear some really scary stuff, you start to hear it -- it's the most irritating thing of the environment. in a forest it's animals and an omnious feeling. in the city, it's motor and city sounds.

he's just the gatekeeper or, perhaps you may even think of him as the "ruler" of the astral. if you're doing well, he'll send nice birds and stuff, but if you're naughty, he'll send happy bird over for a conversation.

he must have been so annoying, nosebook had to absorb him, otherwise he would have been bothering them, so by giving him a platform to express himself, they can restrict his annoyingness from their group. they have the motor cure.

### 2022-09-16 11:46 - why don't DJs use three tables?

I was watching (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_POraCozbQY)) and her style is a bit different in that she dosen't use the crossfader but crossfades a spectrum of frequencies at a time, so I was wondering why not do a third table?

one table is the stable beat, then two are switching off adding to the song. the stable beat doen't have to stay constant the whole mix, as it can be swapped out who the two flashy ones are doing something else.

#### 2022-09-16 13:34 - update

imagine that each table had a list of frequency ranges and for each frequency range, a transformation/filter is applied to it before the sound makes it to output.

this makes it easy to ensure the more constant one is only inputting the frequencies he needs to.

### 2022-09-16 13:47 - you know my form of perception is just the feminine form of thought?

all I did was figure out how to see through through their reality. their reality is really slow moving. you know how science moves forward as a procession of funerals, the feminine form of thought, though there are variations, especially regional, the feminine form of thought evolves very very slowly.

anyone who wants to see really well has to give up on their difficulties with the feminine form of thought. there is a way for a man to acquire feminine form of thougt and use it from a masculine perspective. you'll find out that perspective is neither masculine or feminine. concepts don't have gender or race or anythming like that. those are just attributes of the physical environment they were manifested into.

inotherwords, I think like they do, but I don't have many of the limiting ideas that come along with it. that may be because of logic. logic is kinda like the unlocker to the feminine form of thought. I can analyse something rationally and decide if I like the improvement or not. the conclusion after analysis is always very pragmatic. efficiency over flare.

then to integrate a little bit of flare, I just have an open mind and not to much inhibitions. the only things that can happen to me reflect how I feel. that's also difficcult for some, but once I got my ability to feel the way I wanted, I don't have to worry about bad situations anymore cause I just feel the way that I want. there is nothing more theatric inducing than two people interacting that feel VERY DIFFERENT.

### 2022-09-17 17:50 - the coming individual perspective
#### why I am, and am going to be the biggest hipocrite

the way that I see myself is just the first of many such people that will begin to realise that thy are the universe. prior to this, I don't think anyone has ever been able to do this in the conscious perspective. you'll notice that I can only not hold back relating it, but it's there when I'm sober too. so, you know it looks like I'm a pretty big hypocrite.

the next thing that will be I will be talking about the coming individual perspective, which is on its way to universal perspective, and I'll be talking about it while in a relationship. I'll be a pretty big hypocrite.

#### so what is the individual perspective?

it kinda starts out with "that's not my problem"
I don't really know what else though. it's hard for me to encapsulate but basically it's the universal perspective but from the perspective of the individual. I'll try and figure out better ways to indentify the individual's perspective.

#### doesn't look like there's anything I can do about that.
#### can't do much about that

this concept works well with, "<it|that>'s not my problem"

### 2022-09-18 12:44 - I figured out why higher dimensions feel so slippery

I wondered why people were having such a difficult time when I smoke. the sense that I get is that there's no accurate physical translator for those concepts, so nothing is rendered (rathar than some ambience) and because their brains don't have a concept to render that into space, it feels like you're falling and can't find your orientation (kinda like when really drunk).

one thing would be to render the concepts on top of a backdrop so that high-frequency space is covered over. once you get used to seeing black space in your imagination, it becomes a super great help. I didn't realise that my smoking gives you guys an opportunity to use your feelings more than the pictures. that's pretty awesome, actually.

also, I noticed how they felt like static electrdicity does. I've been getting these pictures of entire microprocessors actually created and rearranged on the fly because the entire circuit of the microprocessor was just a static electricity structure.

this may be how dimensions are encoded, in static electric structures, and that's the kind of grid that goes around the soft flesh pulling the bulk matter toward the verticies (like each vertex is a gravity sphere).

### 2022-09-18 12:59 - another observation about female hierarchy and competition

notice how girls are all hyper attentive to each other that they nocice each other's failures a lot, and so because of it they all are in constant competition (competing men do the same thing). the more "perfect" (less failures) that you are, the higher up in the class system of the female hierarchy you go. come to think of it, the female mindset is most notably aryan. it's kind of a funny thing to think about the idea that the "aryan" race was just an externisation of inside mental system out into a culture and people groups.

you could consider to female groups and cliques to be very similar in migration patterns to the "lost tribes of israel" and all of the others (germanic, goths, huns, persian, etc.) lot's of factioning structures. what keeps them together in these groups is their falures and the other girls in the group are also OK with that type of failure.

### 2022-09-18 15:48 - the one

I noticed that every time that I figure out how to leave the feminine matrix, they want to reintroduce it. so, if you like female companionship, you have to subscribe to their matrix. I can live inside of their matrix and not be so affected by it because my definitions of their concepts differ greatly (rather, their symbolic action potential and meaning). as I get better definitions, their reality matrix starts to slip, and I gain power over the reality matrix. they obviously don't want reality to completely disolve (many strong opinioned females are firmly grounding us in reality -- so it's good). it's kind of like an anchor in that it has to be heavy enough or hook on to a rock to keep the ship stable.

the one is the most stable.
the one is the source (universal) perspective.
the one is the fastest and also the slowest
the one is a twinkle away (however long that could be)
every one is "the" one

---

so what I'm saying is, it's possible to continually create more and more dimensions. as many as can yield an actual different perspective on the same thing. so, it's possible for every "the one" to create their own dimension. the more attractive "the one" (everyone) is, the more their dimension will collide with others. the only way is to go up (no conflict) or different (conflict) when making a new dimesion.

what's nice about this setup is that nobody has to be locked in to any reality matrix, and reality matrixes will all have their own trajectory. for those that are attracting a disaster, I would strongly think about the feminine reality matrix your plugged in to (created by both males and females), so that the intended manifestation is actually something those contributing the most votes can believe.

coming soon: design your own 4d space to your own liking and others will join you there.

#### random thought: it's likely we'll specialise in perspcetives

[this COI idea](/captain-of-industry.md#progression-of-points-of-view) really illustrated this for me, so many people will begin to look at things from a singular perspectives in one of the 7 planes of perception (right now this is only possible in 3d, 4d, 5d).

so, what I'm saying is that team building is always the same and it's that like minded people clump and work well together, so eventually we'll all take part in one of those dimensions for as long as we retain an "individual" perspective (I am a person, I am a concept, a person is a concept, a trend is a concept) so if I lose that, I go non-physical.

so let's say that manouvre is the final boss; what you want to have, is the individual perspective all the way until you're riding the wave back to the source, then it's good to be water my friend. what I mean is that once I've gotten past the "point of no return" I have to see myself as the thing I'll turn myself into. if I think I'm a galaxy, I'm a galaxy. if I'm a person, I become a brand new person (in that plane of perception). I just keep going until one day I realise that I am the universe and from there I cannot avoid the manifestation anymore -- I'm going to see that perspective.

from that point on, I've completely lost control. it's only navigation left to do now. I'm probably pretty free floating now. I haven't lost all density yet though as there are still a lot of things that keep me to the earth; so, from that perspective you could say that I can't really lift off until all of my earthly "karma" is worked out.

### 2022-09-18 16:57 - two perspectives

so, one of the questions that I picked out of the atmosphere was, "OK, what will the next feminine matrix be like?" and honestly I hadn't really thought of it before but it would be nothing like anything a man can dream up (usually performance or goal oriented), but I didn't really have an answer.

the word that came to me (along with a whole concept) was the concept of nurture. imagine that there are only some things that are deemed worthy to nurture. meeting that requirement (of defining what is worthy of nurture), then they enter into their own reality and at first everyone will have the seed concept (of what is worthy of nurture), and but some people will grow to become the polar opposite on it before anyone figures out what it really is.

it's funny, the image this gives me is that these feminine reality matrixes are all based on concepts that we're not likely to contemplate. as long as that reality node stays in place, the curtain is still in front of it. it's a sort of "guess what" game, and the more complicated ideas to guess are things like universes and galaxies (or an atom). oh man, that's the worst joke the universe could play on itself, which is to jump into a guessing game where the concept is not something bigger, but something more elemental, like an atom or a proton. at the end of the "simulation" you have to figure out that you are a X and then from there you manifest yourself at it. imagine how difficult it will be to come to realise you are the universe when you start out with the perspective of an atom. you have to find a way to transcend conceptual barriers. sounds dangerous.

---

a manifestation is ready when it looks inevitable.
now, whether you're ready for the inevitable, or not,
is another thing.

### 2022-09-20 00:41 - if I compliment myself, right afterward I prove my own compliment to be (or not to be) correct

marc said this and I thought it was a funny way to say that concept. I've noticed in my years that the universe tends to try and make it so that I'm always right -- so, without even thinking about it, whatever I believed would sorta start to happen.

what's interesting is that when he said it, I flashed back to my days playing counter-strike, and I had a similar thing happen, where every time I looked at my score and said, "wow, that's a really good score" that proved to be the start of an epic losing streak. it happened pretty much without fail.

I don't have a conclusion there, but it was an interesting past memory. as an aside, it's really easy to mess me up because I'm so easy to get to believe in something (within my capacity to believe it), so for me, it's not so hard to get outdone by those sorts of word traps.

you know another thought that's related to that is also when I was younger, I thought I was invincible, and mom thought it her duty to obliterate that pride from me. so she wanted to often point out when I'm not invincible. I didn't lose it all the way obviously, but that left a habit of noticing the failures a lot and so looking at successes (or even complimenting myself about them) was kind of shameful because I shouldn't be invincible (cause having like a 22-2 score is basically invincible).

there's also (for me at least) a lot of the "I have to lose some time too; I can't win *all* the time" -- but this quality about me is largely hidden because I don't really like to win all that much. in fact, I kind of even like *not* winning now.. not when I was young.

I might think on this more because I do really wonder why I could feel that sense of calling my destruction by noticing my superiority. that's a really not good feeling to have. OH, it's still residual from the meditations where I was strongly attracting superiority complex emotions.

### 2022-09-20 10:15 - electrostatics and gravitation

or, the masculine force as seen through electrostatics.

yesterday, I had quite a few reactions to when I said that tesla's technology is like feminine thought, and also significant reactions were felt where I said that nosebook also pretty well matches feminine thought. combine that idea with another thing that I said yesterday(?) is that I find it interesting that the "aryan" mindset has completely externalised their feminine thought into self-produced egregores. we made our own feminine thought our reality that we're fighting against. ok, enough of the past. though it doesn't feel so good, you'll see resonances of those concepts in the explanation.

---

I like to think of electrostatics as any bit of "charge" that an atom has. charge is actually vibration, and so all atoms all resonate at a very high carrier frequency that all atoms resonate with, and that keeps them alive and together. I believe it's a very high frequency that comes out of the centre of the galaxy, and it's basically like us: a planet with something very energetic inside of it. all planets have them. stars, are all about hydrogen, but a planet is involved with the denser than hydrogen stuff. the hydrogen is the solar stuff that gives you superpowers, which is what we want to avoid. we're going the 110% certified materialistic route. my plan is to develop tons and tons of non-singularity technology (because it's 100% materialistic and doesn't require the sun (feminine energy) to operate).

I think it'd be awesome to be able to fly. the fed guys don't like that because then you could go *anywhere*, but I think they don't like that because they don't have a way to block it, but with this, you do. you kinda make your own force fields and stuff, so it's actually more of a "pushing" technology. to attract, you have to vibrate your atoms similarly to the other atoms that you want to attract. no need for the sun at all. the sun, the ether and all that stuff are neatly *not needed* to do really amazing things.

so after I want flight and force fields, I would want something else like levitation and consciously making my atoms vibrate slightly different to something in my environment causing it or me to float and approach/repel the similarly vibrating atoms. that means that we can also do all of the PK stuff and we'll do it consciously with our minds, just by changing the vibration of the atoms that compose our body.

you thought maybe you were going to see too much well...

it's going to be pretty helpful to be able to "see" those atoms vibrating.

lofty goal,
so we'll see what happens.

the funny thing is,
in this world,
there's no opposition to you;
if you do them the masculine way.

I want to see
if that holds true
with technology as well.
I suspect it does.
