### ray relationships

the sirian guide talks a lot about rays. they define a person as being of a ray type, but also say that we have all ray types. they describe the rays in very physical details (organs and energy centres), but when describing the people, they dscribe them with words like "will to manifest" or how things relate to another...

so, to me each of the rays, is just a form of perception. here are some examples

#### 1st and 7th rays

the 1st ray will look at something from a desire or will perspective, yet a 7th ray will look at the same thing from the opposite -- "what's it's purpose", "what does it do", or "how does it work". they're the same perception, just looked at from opposite ends. the 7th ray looks at the thing and determines the will or the purpose, therefore discovering the underlying desire of the creation, whereas the 1st ray does not see a thing; it just wills/desires to interact with a thing that does not yet have a physical representation.

#### 3rd and 5th rays

the 5th ray will look at something in the form of concepts. each concept is kind of like an aspect of something, and those aspects conduct theirselves according to some logic or behaviour. the 5th ray will enumerate the aspects, looking for the logic, while the 3rd ray will take the logic and find aspects that fit the desired behaviour/logic/archetype. they are the same thing, looked at from opposite directions.

#### 2nd, 4th, and 6th rays

these rays combine two energies. the 2nd combines the 1st and the 3rd together. the 6th combines the 5th and the 7th together, and the 4th combines physical (5-7) and non-physical (1-3) together. said another way, you could see the 2nd as expectations -- a mixture of desire and beliefs/logic. or, you could see the imagination as a mixture of concept/emotion and physical attributes (colour, sound, sensation, etc).

I call the 4th ray "source" because it's basically what I imagine the word we use to say "source" or "God" to be. it's a layer that mixes a physical expression that is so abstract that it's difficult to put into physical terms (ineffable), along with a lot of non-physical stuff (thoughts, logic, beliefs, etc). that's these spiritual experiences are often encountered with DMT, a naturally occurring compound, recently called the "God Molecule". those kinds of "ineffable" experiences (or super high planes on meditation) are basically this plane of perception -- it's difficult to even find concepts which can relate these experineces, and out of them, often times many new concepts are born or rediscovered.

personally, I'm just starting to get used to 2nd/4th/6th ray energies. I'm naturally pretty good at 6th because you will notice that my imagination always perceives the optimal or best form -- and in that sense I'm an eternal optimist. I've learned to be pretty good at 4th ray, and the large part of this document is to begin to activate my 2nd ray perception, as it's by far my weakest aspect.

so, the best way that I can describe 2nd and 6th's interactions is with some examples. the 6th ray is the product team, and the 2nd ray is the sales team. the sales team's goal is to produce an image in the imagination of the perceiver about how well one thing relates to another. as more things are perceived to "satifsy" the deficiency of another thing, the more momentum grows.

I picked the sales team to show a more physical aspect of it, but now however another example could be my memory of terence mckenna. he was very much a 2nd ray in the sense of describing how things relate to each other in poetic form conjured images in people's minds, much like a sales person does when trying to sell a product. their whole goal is to make it feel like it all fits together. this is then tranmitted into the imagination (6), and produces in each person, according to their own conceptions, their own interpretation of the thing. it's sort of like poetry, a love song, or a good story, in that it could mean a lot of different things to many different people. they're very charismatic people.

I'm very charismatic, I've noticed but not for the same reasons. I pick things apart like a 7th ray does, always looking for the purpose or the underlying desire behind the physical thing/action/words, and those get summarised and condensed into concepts for me. I work from the bottom up -- somewhere beteen a 5th and 6th ray, however a 2nd ray works more from the top down.

think, for example if you were a CEO or someting (I always use zaryn as an example for this image), and he wants a thing, but he has no clue how to make it happen in physical implementation. what he has to do is to find a way of making this idea feel possible to the people who will implement it. he has a specific idea of how he wants the different parts to interact ... like access levels, security clearances, or sales tiers ... and those parts need to work together to create the ojective. in order to get this done, he uses that charisma of producing the image in the imagination of everything working together in order to motivate the action.

for now, that's the best I can do. I'm like a 6th ray, taking physical data, and concepts which eventually builds a mental model of how the parts work together. from that I can then show how it all relates and resonates together. this document is an example of that. a 2nd ray does exactly the same thing, but looking at it from the opposite direction -- the best examples I have are zaryn and terence.

### origin of the moon

> The planet [earth] had actually been aborted once before the remains of which are the moon.

### the monad and the soul

it seems that monad is the word that they use for "source" -- a very high frequency form of consciousness not having physical or material qualities.

> The SOUL is to the MONAD as the physical vehicle is to the SOUL. It is made up of a Deva, originating from the sun, that gives its essence so that the MONAD can incarnate into the physical and gain experience. The MONAD can only send itself downward to the point of the SOUL level. At this point, the SOLAR ANGEL collects the MONADs energy, circulating the energy through its essence, then redirecting it into the vehicles that make up the personality.

the SOLAR ANGEL (SOUL) is the top part of the conceptual/mental plane, meaning that the sun provides a conceptual form for the source to incarnate into.

further evidence that the "monad" is just their name for "source" is that in describing the 4th plane, they say that the top 3 rays are the monad:

> The BUDDHIC PLANE, being the second plane from the MONAD, is the receiver and transmitter of SECOND RAY energy from the MONAD. The vehicle thereon is to the MONAD as the emotional or ASTRAL body is to the SOUL.

so, in the non-physical planes of perception, the first three rays compose non-physical (vibrational) reality. those forms then get reflected into their physical counterparts at the midpoint (I've called this source (4)).

apparently, they say that the 2nd layer combines the will to manifest (1) with the mentality of the manifestation (3), and this is transmitted down to the soul which seems to be at the top of the 5th which then connects down to the astral... I think that's confusing.

> the union of the three fires (fire by friction [energy from the earth] = THIRD ASPECT/RAY, solar fire [energy from the soul] = SECOND ASPECT/RAY, and cosmic fire [energy from the monad] = FIRST ASPECT/RAY) within MUN.

it doesn't really say it explicitly, but the "MONAD" appears to be  parts, the father/source/brahm, the soul, and body (experience). the atmic (3) plane is described as being the monad (non-physical) equivalent of the physical (7) plane. or, said differently, "the program, the user, and the environment".

### summary

all of this is pretty complicated. for me, it sounds much easier to say that you take desire (1) to manifest and the logic (3) by which it can manifest (beliefs, expectations, etc); those resonate with eachother in the relational (2), which then reflects through the midpoint source (4), and down into the imagination, producing a combination of mental images (6) that produce physical sensation or reality (7) or a concept or emotion (5). much easier :)

### FIRST RAY life wave

> The SECOND COSMIC RAY is the quality of love and wisdom. You will notice that these two concepts are indeed difficult to concisely and accurately define. There is no one word or succinct phrase to readily convey to anyone else what one thinks love or wisdom means. That is because Love and Wisdom are qualities of Consciousness and therefore, their meaning will vary according to the state of conscious evolution.
  
> Because of this, the THIRD RAY, or mentation, is developed within substance and evolving life waves first. This is so that the consciousness will have a mind to use in developing love. The correct blending of manas and love results in wisdom. Both of these are required before there can safely be a FIRST RAY life wave. Power cannot be safely given to corruptible entities.


what it's saying is that love and wisdom... for now, let's skip defining what love and wisdom is.. let's just say they're the thing that powers life and effective operation of life.

so what they're saying is that when life first begins (sounds like they've done this a few times), they say that 3rd ray aspects are presented first... probably to gain some experience. so like think about primitive animals -- they learn by experience, and a dog can be trained and "learn" to behave in ways based on experience. the reasoning that occurs as a result of that and the mental constructs in which life is understood allow for the formation of "wisdom" -- that is, the understanding of how things actually work together. wisdom sees past the illusion and sees the power (desire) behind the creation or action.

once one can truly see things for how they really are, one can finally perceive what they are calling "love" -- the motivation for *life* -- that is, the wanted aspect. in abraham terms, "finally able to see you for who you really are" or "able to see the wanted aspect without any resistance to unwanted".

it's only then, when able to perceive the wanted aspect can the FIRST RAY life wave occur. this is a clue. they're saying that on our planet it has not yet happened. another clue they give is when they say that the earth is going through it's third initiation -- that is when it becomes fully concerned with the mental(ity) aspect to reality. the third ray triad has saturn and thoth. thoth is credited as saying "the universe is mental" -- or "what you think and feel creates your reality" -- or, your reality is a reflection of how you conceptualise it to be.

they said that the FIRST RAY triad first appeared millions of years ago and was retracted 75kya because we simply did not understand (that is have a way to mentalise) their presense. likely in the same way that we experience too much pleasure = pain -- or, too much desire = fear.

I don't believe that this "FIRST RAY life wave" will appear anytime soon. rather, I think instead, we're going to be doing the "THIRD RAY life wave" right now.

the other day I was [thinking about a possible fifth ray triad](sirian-guide/triad#family-ties-and-a-hidden-5th-ray-triad), and I noted that if we think of vulcan not just as a ground, but also as a kind of opposite polarity female.

females transmit and receive on their ray type. men, it seems transmit on their ray type and receive on the opposite. it also says that allayandra (+7) is mentally connected with jeortau (+2), and anatau (-1), and in her presence, he can wield energy as if he were a first ray male (+1). I then noticed that vulcan (-5+) receives on 5 just like a female, but does not transmit on (5). instead he transmits on (3). that means, in a virtual triad of vulcan, jeortau, allayandra -- in the presence of anatau, he is a (+1) and vulcan is a (-+3), and jeortau remains (+2). in this virtual triad, vulcan is now behaving like a (-3) female -- or unessa.

this brings me to the THIRD RAY triad of saturn (+-4), unessa (-3), and thoth (+7). unessa here in this virtual triad is played by vulcan, leaving a missing FOURTH RAY ground of and thoth. everyone wants to be thoth -- so there's no short supply of him.

in the earth changes section, it says that sanate kumara is going through the third initiation. I didn't know what sanate kumara is so I looked it up and he's a blonde dude with whispy hair and magnificent eyes. they seem to be calling him "earth". see for yourself..

> Such a time is upon you. Sanate Kumara is about to undergo the THIRD Cosmic initiation. (Third as is relative to his class of entity) You will recall that this initiation marks a major increase in Spiritual consciousness. It is the one where upon the SOUL comes in control of the personality. This initiation marks the first initiation that brings in higher energy from an outside source. After this initiation, Earth will become what is referred to as a Spiritual or Esoteric planet. Heretofore, that has definitely not been the case.

OK, what we can draw from this is that the planet itself is going through the third initiation, and this third initiation will bring down the FIRST RAY life wave (I guess)

> At the consummation of the third initiation, ... this energy has been combined with the SECOND ASPECT/RAY within the consciousness of the MUN. This brings down the "fire" from the MONAD which is of the FIRST ASPECT/RAY.

we're in a SECOND RAY (solar) system, so that means the second ray will be the sun herself. so now we have our new FIRST RAY triad for the FIRST RAY life wave.

- allayandra + anatau (+1)
- sun (-2)
- opposite polarity vulcan (-+3)

I can't say that I fully understand it. I just have this document and my intuition to go on, but what it looks to me is another strange polarity. the sun will be playing the part of jeortau (+2), which means she still receives (2) energy from somewhere -- but then that would make her a second female in the triad.. so, it looks to me like just an opposite polarity triad, where vulcan plays the female and she plays the male. I can't really say for sure. though, if she's missing the (-2) part, that means a reinvention of the isis, osiris, and ra SECOND RAY triad is next.

OK, I'm so far out here, I'm going to quit now while I'm ahead. I have a lot of similarities to osiris (see yesterday's work on that), but for now... I'm done with all of this solar system stuff.

### 2nd ray conflict

> The SECOND RAY has within its equipment the active intelligence of the THIRD RAY. The FIRST RAY has within its equipment the quality of love and active intelligence, all of which is powered by the relentless pursuit of purpose. This means that the FIRST RAY has all the assets and liabilities of the other two. The quest of mental pursuits is strong within them; so is the desire of and for love but the THIRD RAY attribute harmonizes with the FIRST RAY better and is more useful in the pursuit of the purpose so the FIRST RAY hides and even tries to deny all of the SECOND RAY qualities. Of course, this does not work and creates conflict within.

> The whole of the FIRST RAY triad is influenced by this inner battle. Most overtly affected is Jeortau, a beautiful creature, powerfully driven toward his goal of cosmic Quin; yet he is inwardly haunted by the need to be loved, to socialize as other SECOND RAYs and to be admired for his sacrificial role. He is a dove of peace and beauty at war with his desires and purpose. Actually, he was the most admired, appreciated and loved for the work he did cosmically by the whole of this galaxy; but was never able to accept it as being good enough.

> The THIRD RAY, being concerned with mental action does not respond with as much ardor, enthusiasm or interest to relationships with the opposite sex. This causes difficulty with their relationships within a SECOND RAY system or with a SECOND RAY of the opposite sex.

> SECOND RAY males like to be radiated onto by females and the females like to radiate upon them, therefore Isis and Jeortau got along well.

---

as you can see, a second ray loves to be radiated upon by females, but having also third ray qualities, he is torn because that side "concerned with mental action does not respond with as much ardor, enthusiasm or interest to relationships with the opposite sex."

the other conflict is one of perspective. as I've been listening to the "book of the damned", I've been coming into perspective of this conflict myself. the book does a great job at attempting to categorise and fit all of the things into place, yet fails miserably at relating the things together. the author laments this himself in an ongoing discussion on the "positivist" and the "intermediatist" -- the concept being that all things are a sort of gradiant -- like a rainbow, and we do our best to say, well those wavelengths are red, these are blue ones, and these are green -- and that works pretty well when you have just a pure colour tone. if any mixing happens, it starts to get really difficult to say: does the signal need to just vibrate x times a second to be in the red colour spectrum, or what if the wave quality is one way versus another -- not all sounds are a perfect sine wave tone. so to listen to a sound and say, "ah, that's a 120Hz sound, of course" is totally missing the point. an infinitude of things can be represented in 120Hz...

so then we say, OK, if the sound has a loud cracking sound to it, then we'll call that a snare drum -- but now we've lost the identified "colour" (frequency spectrum) of the sound and are now describing its quality. 

basically, it's next to impossible to put a definite category on something in either time (frequency) or space (waveform). perceiving its qualities in both time & space together, definite points can be placed on the map, but then now it's just another data point.. a bunch of them are in the same general position, but how do they *relate* to eachother?

---

the problem with a second ray in this sense is the constant desire to relate things based on their resonance (feel), while the inner third ray wants to just look for patterns in data and identifiable units.

these two aspects seem to be pretty incompatible.

### 3rd ray conflict

in the first ray triad, sanatau (+-3-+) was paiered with anatau (-1). that means that she powered his creations and his creativity with her desire for the manifestation of those creations.

in my own life, I have noted a tremendous difference in my creative output when someone desires my creation, and someone does not. this is most exemplified for me in tuenti when I wanted to create something that zaryn (+2) did not want. it also manifested in a conflict of creation with dani (+3) and marcos (+3) when we would conflict on the "way" it was to be implemented (dani in the technical sense and marcos in the conceptual sense).

if I wanted to create things my way, I needed to figure out how to power my own creations with my own desire. all I wanted was for them to just desire my creation purely -- and so I was looking for them to play the role of a 1st ray female (-1). obviously that's not cool for a man to play such an attractive and receptive role, so what ended up happening is I would become the first ray female and desire their implementation of that product. they didn't want to fulfil my desire, so things naturally fell apart, because of vibrational incompatibility (this same pattern can also seen with tesla's interactions with morgan over wardencliffe).

a 3rd ray wants an opposite polarity 1st ray to support them -- so, if she's a female like unessa (-3), she desires a 1st ray male (+1). or if it's ra (+3), he desires a 1st ray female (-1). neither of them had what they wanted, so they had to produce what they wanted by forcing the neutral/ground to behave according to their desires (and now the progression of the triads becomes obvious).

so if you begin your perception from the 6th or 2nd layer, you will naturally have the 2nd ray conflict, and those beginning their perception from the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 7th layers will experience this internal conflict of desiring a 1st ray of the opposite sex to power their creativity (the esoteric "grail quest" where the "ark" is the opposite sex 1st ray to empower the process).
