### ray relationships

the sirian guide talks a lot about rays. they define a person as being of a ray type, but also say that we have all ray types. they describe the rays in very physical details (organs and energy centres), but when describing the people, they dscribe them with words like "will to manifest" or how things relate to another...

so, to me each of the rays, is just a form of perception. here are some examples

#### 1st and 7th rays

the 1st ray will look at something from a desire or will perspective, yet a 7th ray will look at the same thing from the opposite -- "what's it's purpose", "what does it do", or "how does it work". they're the same perception, just looked at from opposite ends. the 7th ray looks at the thing and determines the will or the purpose, therefore discovering the underlying desire of the creation, whereas the 1st ray does not see a thing; it just wills/desires to interact with a thing that does not yet have a physical representation.

#### 3rd and 5th rays

the 5th ray will look at something in the form of concepts. each concept is kind of like an aspect of something, and those aspects conduct theirselves according to some logic or behaviour. the 5th ray will enumerate the aspects, looking for the logic, while the 3rd ray will take the logic and find aspects that fit the desired behaviour/logic/archetype. they are the same thing, looked at from opposite directions.

#### 2nd, 4th, and 6th rays

these rays combine two energies. the 2nd combines the 1st and the 3rd together. the 6th combines the 5th and the 7th together, and the 4th combines physical (5-7) and non-physical (1-3) together. said another way, you could see the 2nd as expectations -- a mixture of desire and beliefs/logic. or, you could see the imagination as a mixture of concept/emotion and physical attributes (colour, sound, sensation, etc).

I call the 4th ray "source" because it's basically what I imagine the word we use to say "source" or "God" to be. it's a layer that mixes a physical expression that is so abstract that it's difficult to put into physical terms (ineffable), along with a lot of non-physical stuff (thoughts, logic, beliefs, etc). that's these spiritual experiences are often encountered with DMT, a naturally occurring compound, recently called the "God Molecule". those kinds of "ineffable" experiences (or super high planes on meditation) are basically this plane of perception -- it's difficult to even find concepts which can relate these experineces, and out of them, often times many new concepts are born or rediscovered.

personally, I'm just starting to get used to 2nd/4th/6th ray energies. I'm naturally pretty good at 6th because you will notice that my imagination always perceives the optimal or best form -- and in that sense I'm an eternal optimist. I've learned to be pretty good at 4th ray, and the large part of this document is to begin to activate my 2nd ray perception, as it's by far my weakest aspect.

so, the best way that I can describe 2nd and 6th's interactions is with some examples. the 6th ray is the product team, and the 2nd ray is the sales team. the sales team's goal is to produce an image in the imagination of the perceiver about how well one thing relates to another. as more things are perceived to "satifsy" the deficiency of another thing, the more momentum grows.

I picked the sales team to show a more physical aspect of it, but now however another example could be my memory of terence mckenna. he was very much a 2nd ray in the sense of describing how things relate to each other in poetic form conjured images in people's minds, much like a sales person does when trying to sell a product. their whole goal is to make it feel like it all fits together. this is then tranmitted into the imagination (6), and produces in each person, according to their own conceptions, their own interpretation of the thing. it's sort of like poetry, a love song, or a good story, in that it could mean a lot of different things to many different people. they're very charismatic people.

I'm very charismatic, I've noticed but not for the same reasons. I pick things apart like a 7th ray does, always looking for the purpose or the underlying desire behind the physical thing/action/words, and those get summarised and condensed into concepts for me. I work from the bottom up -- somewhere beteen a 5th and 6th ray, however a 2nd ray works more from the top down.

think, for example if you were a CEO or someting (I always use zaryn as an example for this image), and he wants a thing, but he has no clue how to make it happen in physical implementation. what he has to do is to find a way of making this idea feel possible to the people who will implement it. he has a specific idea of how he wants the different parts to interact ... like access levels, security clearances, or sales tiers ... and those parts need to work together to create the ojective. in order to get this done, he uses that charisma of producing the image in the imagination of everything working together in order to motivate the action.

for now, that's the best I can do. I'm like a 6th ray, taking physical data, and concepts which eventually builds a mental model of how the parts work together. from that I can then show how it all relates and resonates together. this document is an example of that. a 2nd ray does exactly the same thing, but looking at it from the opposite direction -- the best examples I have are zaryn and terence.

### origin of the moon

> The planet had actually been aborted once before the remains of which are the moon.

### the monad and the soul

it seems that monad is the word that they use for "source" -- a very high frequency form of consciousness not having physical or material qualities.

> The SOUL is to the MONAD as the physical vehicle is to the SOUL. It is made up of a Deva, originating from the sun, that gives its essence so that the MONAD can incarnate into the physical and gain experience. The MONAD can only send itself downward to the point of the SOUL level. At this point, the SOLAR ANGEL collects the MONADs energy, circulating the energy through its essence, then redirecting it into the vehicles that make up the personality.

the SOLAR ANGEL (SOUL) is the top part of the conceptual/mental plane, meaning that the sun provides a conceptual form for the source to incarnate into.

further evidence that the "monad" is just their name for "source" is that in describing the 4th plane, they say that the top 3 rays are the monad:

> The BUDDHIC PLANE, being the second plane from the MONAD, is the receiver and transmitter of SECOND RAY energy from the MONAD. The vehicle thereon is to the MONAD as the emotional or ASTRAL body is to the SOUL.

so, in the non-physical planes of perception, the first three rays compose non-physical (vibrational) reality. those forms then get reflected into their physical counterparts at the midpoint (I've called this source (4)).

apparently, they say that the 2nd layer combines the will to manifest (1) with the mentality of the manifestation (3), and this is transmitted down to the soul which seems to be at the top of the 5th which then connects down to the astral... I think that's confusing.

> the union of the three fires (fire by friction [energy from the earth] = THIRD ASPECT/RAY, solar fire [energy from the soul] = SECOND ASPECT/RAY, and cosmic fire [energy from the monad] = FIRST ASPECT/RAY) within MUN.

it doesn't really say it explicitly, but the "MONAD" appears to be  parts, the father/source/brahm, the soul, and body (experience). the atmic (3) plane is described as being the monad (non-physical) equivalent of the physical (7) plane. or, said differently, "the program, the user, and the environment".

### summary

all of this is pretty complicated. for me, it sounds much easier to say that you take desire (1) to manifest and the logic (3) by which it can manifest (beliefs, expectations, etc); those resonate with eachother in the relational (2), which then reflects through the midpoint source (4), and down into the imagination, producing a combination of mental images (6) that produce physical sensation or reality (7) or a concept or emotion (5). much easier :)
