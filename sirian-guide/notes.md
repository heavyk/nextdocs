### the monad and the soul

it seems that monad is the word that they use for "source" -- a very high frequency form of consciousness not having physical or material qualities.

> The SOUL is to the MONAD as the physical vehicle is to the SOUL. It is made up of a Deva, originating from the sun, that gives its essence so that the MONAD can incarnate into the physical and gain experience. The MONAD can only send itself downward to the point of the SOUL level. At this point, the SOLAR ANGEL collects the MONADs energy, circulating the energy through its essence, then redirecting it into the vehicles that make up the personality.

the SOLAR ANGEL (SOUL) is the top part of the conceptual/mental plane, meaning that the sun provides a conceptual form for the source to incarnate into.

further evidence that the "monad" is just their name for "source" is that in describing the 4th plane, they say that the top 3 rays are the monad:

> The BUDDHIC PLANE, being the second plane from the MONAD, is the receiver and transmitter of SECOND RAY energy from the MONAD. The vehicle thereon is to the MONAD as the emotional or ASTRAL body is to the SOUL.

so, in the non-physical planes of perception, the first three rays compose non-physical (vibrational) reality. those forms then get reflected into their physical counterparts at the midpoint (I've called this source (4)).

apparently, they say that the 2nd layer combines the will to manifest (1) with the mentality of the manifestation (3), and this is transmitted down to the soul which seems to be at the top of the 5th which then connects down to the astral... I think that's confusing.

### summary

all of this is pretty complicated. for me, it sounds much easier to say that you take desire (1) to manifest and the logic (3) by which it can manifest (beliefs, expectations, etc); those resonate with eachother in the relational (2), which then reflects through the midpoint source (4), and down into the imagination, producing a combination of mental images (6) that produce physical sensation or reality (7) or a concept or emotion (5). much easier :)
