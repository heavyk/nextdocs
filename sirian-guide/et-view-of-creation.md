### fractal of the whole

in the original creation they're giving here, there is a 7th ray *elder* (first life wave), influences the children (primary triads, second life wave) to do his bidding. this causes a bunch of dissention amongst the creators and then is "thrown out of heaven"

> this myth has been brought down in other cultures and other religions that refers to the discord in heaven and the casting out of Satan, which that is not his name by the way, but it shall suffice so that your consciousnesses can understand.

so the only other reference to satan is in the 3rd ray triad of saturn, venus, and thoth.

according to my own research, I find that the polarity swap makes sanatau the most likely candidate for the "lucifer" that "fell from heaven". I can't be sure though, as it assigns saturn to satan.

one clue to this is that there's a lot missing about a planet between jupiter and mars. they call it zyron, and I don't really understand it well.

the second clue is that they explain that third rays have trouble with relationships with the opposite sex.

> The THIRD RAY, being concerned with mental action does not respond with as much ardor, enthusiasm or interest to relationships with the opposite sex. This causes difficulty with their relationships within a SECOND RAY system or with a SECOND RAY of the opposite sex.

I see two major conflicts:

- ra (+3) is in a triad with isis (-2).
- unessa/venus (-3) and jeortau (+2).

complicating things, jeortau (+3) and isis (-2) got along well:

> SECOND RAY males like to be radiated onto by females and the females like to radiate upon them, therefore Isis and Jeortau got along well.

though, jeortau and ra were supposedly (diplomatic schemes) buddies:

> Due to the closeness of Isis and Osiris, Ra was able to carry out diplomatic schemes with Jeortau all over the Universe.

legends have stories about osiris being destroyed and isis putting him back together. this must have have been done in this scheme by ra.

there are also legends of saturn getting wrecked by by his son, jupiter. jupiter must be jeortau in this case.

there are two destructions of mankind that are listed. the first one happened because the vehicles were "unsuitable" -- but legend tells us that the vehicles were actually too good. they had too good of eyesight, hearing, etc. so a veil was put over their senses. the 

this is interesting because jupiter is in a sympathetic relationship with the sun, and let's say for a moment that jupiter is jeortau (+2), which is the opposite polarity of the sun which is (-2) -- I'm fairly certain. it [fits the triads](triads#family-ties-and-a-hidden-5th-ray-triad), and they say it's a 2nd ray system. so they're linked now.

it doesn't appear that jeortau/jupiter and the sun have the same difficulties they used to anymore.

so let's now assume that sanatau (+-3-+) is lucifer and that planet zyron/tiamat. the sun is (-2) and so she loves to radiate upon jupiter:

- zyron (+-3-+)
- jupiter (+2)
- sol (-2)

this must have caused the conflict.

before saturn was uranus, who was castrated by saturn. uranus must then be sanatau which was the first polarity reversal.

### creators as planets

> And so approximately 5 million years ago this coalition was created. Ships were sent to the Solar System to discover planets that were suitable for the purpose. *With the technology of this civilization, along with the augmentation of that of the creators, all of the twelve planets around Sol could be used.*

> The earth research team continued working with the genetic structure improving and refining the vehicles that would eventually contain the consciousnesses of the infected ones, *as well as have a planetary consciousness of their own.*

so there are 4 triads, (8 males, 4 females). I had always assumed that the planets are all males, while the sun is female, but this sort of implies that the 12 planets originally mentioned correspond to 12 creators.

I had always considered the 4 triads as different conceptual entites that various planets and bodies contained aspects of, meaning that, for example, jupiter/zeus is not the real guy -- but he's an incarnate derivative of one of the 7th ray males. same with vulcan/typhon or sanatau/ptah.

the reason why I say this, is elsewhere it says that the triads are pure energy, and then took on form:

> The preceding descriptions of the entities that made up the Atlantean pantheon were intentional humunized. That is, we pointed out the problems that would be encountered by any entity that attempted to bring into the physical plane of planet Earth, in a physical body contributed by that planet, unadulterated Ray Energy. *These entities were and are pure personifications of their Rays and in the state in which they came to earth*, were not subject to those faults that we used to illustrate. *They were perfected energy manifestations and as such could not occupy what you would call physical matter.*

this is where I got my original idea that these creator triads are concepts which then the planets are tuned to, and the result of these planet's physical transmission with these energies is what influences the solar cycles, sunspots, etc. and is why, in astrology, the angle of the planets are considered relevant to the personality.

### polarity confusion

the other thing is that in another place they call planets "collection points" and suns energy sources:

> The perfect shape in the Universe is a sphere and thus collection points in the shape of spheres were created. On the physical plane you refer to these as planets. Energy sources were installed which you could correlate with suns; quasars

the emitters in their system of polarities are the *males*, and the females, the receptive (collectors). this contradicts their position on the planet 

### the 12 planets

> With the technology of this civilization, along with the augmentation of that of the creators, all of the twelve planets around Sol could be used.

so, there are 12 planets, and then one sun. that reminds me of jesus and the 12 disciples -- which most definitely has to be symbolic of that, but none of the disciples except perhaps john could be considered a female, and definitely none as venus. so, that's out.


quite frankly, I'm stumped by these 12 planets bit. above, they talk about these "creators" as having planetary consciousnesses

- mercury (thoth, +7)
- venus (unessa, -3)
- earth ()
- mars (+7)
- zyron (blown up)
- jupiter ()
- saturn (+-4)
- uranus ()
- neptune
- pluto
- charon (?)
- sun (?)
- moon (?)
