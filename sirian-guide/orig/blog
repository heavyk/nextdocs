				<h2><a href="http://geohanover.com/blog/?p=172" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Visit from the Christ">Visit from the Christ</a></h2>

				<p>Those people who don&#8217;t want to believe in anything feel that the Christ is mythical. Those people who go to various churches talk about Christ but believe that he is impossible to reach. Of course, this goes against the teachings of the Christ.</p>
<p>I spent quite a bit of time in church when I was growing up.  Being an individual that processes and organizes data, I noticed a great many contradictions. The one thing that was consistent was the teachings of the Christ. Those things actually contradicted much of what was talked about in the sermons.</p>
<p>Although Jesus was revered, there didn&#8217;t appear to be any understanding of the message that he presented throughout his life.</p>
<p>For instance, the Christ always made himself available to anyone at any time; he treated everyone as special with unconditional love. Yet the church, and most churches, made it seem that communion with the Christ was out of reach. And the last thing you wanted to do was convey to people that you had ACTUALLY been in contact with the Christ.</p>
<p>Yes, to churches, it&#8217;s all words. It&#8217;s like the scene from Heaven Sent where the angel is in the church to meet one of his assignments and notices that the priest is being harsh with the choir of children. He approaches the priest and calms him with a touch on the shoulder. He tells the priest the voices of the choir sound like angels which he has heard. The priest looks at him like he was crazy. But the choir then goes on to perform the song in a beautiful manner.</p>
<p>All words but no belief. Yet, the Christ was serious when he said he would be there for you; I had my own personal experience about 37 years ago.</p>
<p>At the time, I was practicing hypnotherapy and had a client who was conflicted with what his subconscious mind was trying to tell him. I suggested a hypnosis session to clarify things.</p>
<p>I wanted to record the session but he refused.</p>
<p>A hypnosis session is always interesting as the subconscious mind is infinite. The client was just a regular person. He was not philosophical or artistic. Yet, he immediately starts describing a beautiful meadow with a path. Someone is at the top of a hill on the path. I tell the client to take the path to the person he sees standing there looking at him.</p>
<p>He does this in his mind and then he starts repeating a message for me.</p>
<p>The message is about issues I have been dealing with in my life; issues unknown to the client.</p>
<p>After the message has finished, I asked the client who is providing the message. The client is very upset and says that he isn&#8217;t worthy to touch his sandals. Finally I get out of him that it was Christ.</p>
<p>My client didn&#8217;t know that I had been focusing on Christ for guidance. I guess I was blocking or not recognizing the answers at a conscious level so the Christ used another method to communicate with me. I regret that I did not turn on the recorder for that message needed to be preserved.</p>
<p>The impact was traumatic. With his Catholic background, he couldn&#8217;t accept that the Christ had come to him and worked through him. It was the last time I saw him.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sad really. It should have shown him of great things but his own beliefs were such that the power of Christ directly working through him just didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>I hear from the Christ from time to time. He presented an Easter message that I hope you will read by clicking on the title:</p>
<h1 align="center"><a title="The Power of Creation is Unconditional Love" href="http://www.geohanover.com/docs/140418_Christ"><span style="color: blue;">The Power of Creation is Unconditional Love</span></a><span style="color: blue;"><br />
</span></h1>
<p>Remember the power of Christ is there for you too.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://geohanover.com/blog/?p=136" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to JFK &#8211; Why Was He Killed?">JFK &#8211; Why Was He Killed?</a></h2>

				<p>November 22, 1963 was a tragic day for the United States when the President was murdered in a hail of bullets. Witnesses identified gun fire coming from several directions with multiple shots fired. Yet, almost immediately, a coverup was initiated to hide what really happened.</p>
<p>Why was so much effort put into covering up the crime of the century? What was there to hide?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been 50 years since that tragic day. From the beginning, competent researchers such as Harold Weisberg and Mark Lane demonstrated there was a cover up.  Since that time, many other researchers have sifted through the evidence, at least the evidence that was not destroyed or altered, and come to the conclusion that President Kennedy&#8217;s death was the result of a conspiracy. Even the House Committee had to begrudgingly admit there was a conspiracy. But why the elaborate cover up?</p>
<p>There have been many reasons for the murder of JFK proposed by numerous researchers, however for myself, they didn&#8217;t make sense. Everything that Kennedy supposedly did to aggravate various groups who likely were complicit in the murder could have easily been undone. Why the extraordinary spectacle of a public execution by multiple shooters?</p>
<p>Finally, after 50 years, a book was published that I feel gives the real reason President Kennedy was murdered. The book is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982290268/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0982290268&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=caroscounmusi-20">Kennedy&#8217;s Last Stand: Eisenhower, UFOs, MJ-12 &amp; JFK&#8217;s Assassination</a>.  The conclusion is simple: President Kennedy wanted to reveal to the world the existence of extra-terrestrials, their technology and the fact the government had contact with them.</p>
<p>The book by Dr. Michael E. Salla provides documentation that it was this quest by President Kennedy that got him murdered.</p>
<p>Those of us that were alive when John Kennedy was President remember that the media loved him and actually created an image of brilliance and trust. I can assure you that if President Kennedy went on television and announced to the world that extra-terrestrials existed and were in contact with Earth, it would have been accepted at face value. Not only that, people would not have freaked out because President Kennedy was a trusted man.</p>
<p>Of all the things President Kennedy wanted to do to improve this county, things that researchers have speculated as the cause of his murder, all could have been undone easily. Some probably would have not even been possible due to Congress. In other words, what traditional reseachers have listed as the reasons President Kennedy was murdered make no sense. However, the reason presented by Dr. Salla is one thing that COULD NOT be undone. If President Kennedy addressed the world that extra-terrestrials existed, that we had some of their technology and had on-going contract with species from other planets, it would never go away.  It would also, in my opinion, make the world a better place which I feel is WHY he wanted to reveal the existence of extra-terrestrials.</p>
<p>President John Kennedy was murdered because he wanted to unite the world. It&#8217;s sad that most people will never believe why he was really killed because the disinformation campaigns to hide the existence of extra-terrestials have been effective. I urge you to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982290268/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0982290268&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=caroscounmusi-20">Kennedy&#8217;s Last Stand: Eisenhower, UFOs, MJ-12 &amp; JFK&#8217;s Assassination</a>.

				<h2><a href="http://geohanover.com/blog/?p=114" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Do Extra-Terrestrials Exist? 1947 Roswell Incident says Yes!">Do Extra-Terrestrials Exist? 1947 Roswell Incident says Yes!</a></h2>

				<p>For a long time, there has been the debate of whether or not extra-terrestrials exist. The official line is that they do not. What complicates the official line is the hundreds of thousands of people world-wide who have seen flying vehicles far in advance of human technology. Yet with all the witnesses, the photographs and video, as well as physical evidence from landing sites, the official line is: there is no evidence!</p>
<p>The truth is, there is plenty of evidence in plain sight. However, human nature is to ignore extraordinary happenings. Just look at the way psychic people are treated. When people don&#8217;t want to believe something, they will accept whatever information tells them it doesn&#8217;t exist. They will ignore the facts and in many cases their own senses!</p>
<p>Since it&#8217;s the 66th anniversary, it&#8217;s appropriate to talk about the most famous case of extra-terrestrial contact with Earth; the Roswell, New Mexico crash of 1947. For a short period of time, the military actually told the truth: they had recovered a flying disc. Then, someone up the chain of command decided they didn&#8217;t want people knowing that extra-terrestrials existed and put out the phony story that it was a downed weather balloon.</p>
<p>People accepted such a silly explanation because they wanted to. If they had thought about it, the military identifying a common weather balloon as a flying disc shows great incompetence. When you add to the fact, this particular group of the military was in charge of the atomic bombs, it makes the explanation even more outrageously unbelievable.</p>
<p>So, what really happened? The first story reported was the truth, an extra-terrestrial vehicle was recovered along with the dead alien crew. To make the outrageous story of the weather balloon work, all the military people involved were forced to sign non-disclosure agreements to never tell what they saw. Apparently, President Truman personally requested many of them to never talk about what they saw.</p>
<p>The crash site was scrubbed clean over many days. All the extra-terrestrial material was moved to a secure location. All the civilian witnesses were threatened with death to themselves and their families if they talked. All this has been documented with intense research done by many people.</p>
<p>Most of the witnesses kept silent until their death. However, one brave individual, Jesse Marcel, toward the latter part of his life, talked a little about it. He did not tell all he knew but he did say it was not a weather balloon or anything else man-made. Since he was the base intelligence officer at the time, it got some researchers interested and that&#8217;s why we know today, that a flying disc was recovered around Roswell in 1947.</p>
<p>Since that time in the late 1970s, many books have been written, some good, some mediocre and some pure disinformation trying to claim it was a weather balloon. The best books clearly demonstrate a flying disc of extra-terrestrial origin was recovered and documented by many witnesses who were persuaded to talk.</p>
<p>However, the final affirmation that a flying disc and dead extra-terrestrials were recovered around Roswell, New Mexico in 1947 was provided by two researchers who spent decades establishing rapport and earned the trust of many witnesses. Thomas J. Carey and Donald R. Schmitt spent a great deal of time and money documenting the Roswell crash. They also accomplished something that no other researchers had been able to do; they got one of the principle military witnesses to go on the record as to what he had seen. Their book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601630662/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1601630662&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=caroscounmusi-20">Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the Government&#8217;s Biggest Cover-up (Revised and Expanded Edition)</a>, basically documents just what happened in 1947 when an extra-terrestrial craft crashed. The book provides much new evidence and puts all the evidence together.</p>
<p>But the highlight of the book is the military witness that went on the record. The man was former Lt. Walter Haut, the base public relations officer who was tasked with delivering the crashed disc recovery story to the media. What most people don&#8217;t realize is that Lt. Haut was close friends of the commanding officer, Col. Blanchard. It was at Col. Blanchard&#8217;s direction that the press release of the recovered flying disc was distributed.</p>
<p>As a friend of Col. Blanchard, he was allowed to see what was really recovered. However, Col. Blanchard asked him to promise he would never reveal it as long as he lived.  Lt. Haut honored that promise even though as the years passed, he really wanted to tell the truth about what has become known as The Roswell Incident. In fact, Mr. Haut was the founder of the UFO Museum in Roswell but never revealed what her personally knew. Toward the end of former his life, Carey and Schmitt came up with the perfect solution for him to both honor his promise to Blanchard and also tell people what really happened in Roswell; they suggested that he have an affidavit prepared of what he had seen and have it sealed to be released upon his death. Haut, who was getting elderly, felt this was a good way to do both; to honor his word to his friend and also, tell the world what really happened. The affidavit was prepared and sealed.</p>
<p>Just a few years after the affidavit was prepared, Haut passed away. His family released the affidavit to the public and this amazing testimony is included in Witness to Roswell. There were also very small news articles about the it buried in the back pages of news media.</p>
<p>In sum, it says that Col. Blanchard took him to the hangar where the recovered disc was stored. He saw the alien craft and also, from a distance, saw the bodies of the dead crew.  Yes, the Roswell Incident was an extra-terrestrial event.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601630662/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1601630662&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=caroscounmusi-20">Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the Government&#8217;s Biggest Cover-up (Revised and Expanded Edition)</a> was published after Haut&#8217;s death which allowed the affidavit to be included. It is the most exciting book I have ever read. A true detective story of one of the most meaningful events to humanity. Read the book and you can laugh when someone says the Roswell Incident was a weather balloon. One of the actual witnesses went on the record to tell the truth; it WAS an extra-terrestrial craft and dead aliens were recovered!</p>

				<h2><a href="http://geohanover.com/blog/?p=81" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to December 21, 2012 &#8211; An Energy Cycle Change">December 21, 2012 &#8211; An Energy Cycle Change</a></h2>

				<p>People are wondering what is going to happen on Dec. 21, 2012.</p>
<p>Well, the effects of what is happening are already being felt.</p>
<p>Dec. 21, 2012 is the zero point where the old energy cycle ends and the new one begins.</p>
<p>This new energy will cause changes to take place on the earth.  The planet will reshape itself to harmonize with the new energy. Needless to say, that means volcanoes and earthquakes along with tidal waves. If you happen to be in an area that is going to be reshaped, pay attention; you can leave in time.</p>
<p>The new energy is called the Seventh Ray energy. Look up what has been written about this energy. From the early morning hours of Dec. 21,2012, it will start to build momentum. Things that depend on the old sixth ray energy will begin to malfunction and eventually stop working. You may have noticed in the past few years how many more things are breaking down.</p>
<p>The ramifications for the psychie are going to be just as drastic as the volcanoes and earthquakes. The power of the mind will be amplified for good or bad. Those who are not in control of their thoughts will have big problems over time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s coming. Be ready!</p>
<p>The Master Kathumi has kindly provided some insight and guidance as to what December 21, 2012 really means to humanity and the planet. I encourage you to read these communications in the new section, 2012 Communications.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://geohanover.com/blog/?p=44" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Are OUIJA Boards Dangerous?">Are OUIJA Boards Dangerous?</a></h2>

				<p>I&#8217;ve seen so much garbage about Ouija boards, I wanted to write a post to present my experiences.</p>
<p>Ouija boards have been marketed as a game for probably 100 years. It is a board with letters of the alphabet printed on them. Two people operate a pointer that moves to the letters spelling out a message. Sometimes, a single person can operate it.</p>
<p>Pretty harmless, really. Yet, all the ghost hunter shows act like they are evil.</p>
<p>In reality, most of the messages through a Ouija board are from the subconscious; just a convenient way to have subconscious communication.</p>
<p>Over time though, a sensitive person can actually develop spirit communication because spirits look for such people. If you are sensitive, it&#8217;s going to happen so you need to learn how to deal with it effectively. It&#8217;s not the Ouija board doing it, it is your own talent.</p>
<p>Just as with ghost hunting, if you draw attention to yourself in the spirit world, be perpared to deal with it.</p>
<p>In reality, if you are a sensitive, the spirit world already knows it because they can see your energy signature. So learn what to do so you can benefit from your talent.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t fall for the garbage that ouija boards are evil or cause ghosts to get after you.</p>
