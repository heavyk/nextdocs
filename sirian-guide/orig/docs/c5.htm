   The LAST thing that Leslie Lecron ever intended was for his book to 
   be associated with psychic phenomena. Yet, in his book, I discovered 
   all the tools necessary to open the door to psychic development.
  </P>
  <P>
   I had been fascinated by the concept of reincarnation since I first 
   read of it in 1972. Subconscious communication via the pendulum 
   quickly opened that door. I found out that my subconscious was 
   literally eager to &quot;talk&quot; about previous existences.
  </P>
  <P>
   The practice of deep hypnosis started to build a bridge to the 
   distant past and although I wasn't aware of it at the time, to start 
   the process of developing abilities that I didn't realize I had.
  </P>
  <P>
   The pendulum was great. It was easy to use and I developed a method 
   to reduce conscious interference, or distortion, of the answers. I 
   also developed the ideo motor finger responses where your 
   subconscious raises a different fingers for yes and no. However, 
   Lecron mentioned a more involved method of subconscious communication 
   that he said was very difficult to develop: automatic writing. I was 
   intrigued. The thought of my hand writing by itself, or under 
   subconscious control, was exciting. So, I decided to develop it.
  </P>
  <P>
   I quickly found out that Lecron had not exaggerated the difficulty of 
   developing automatic writing. I followed his directions carefully. 
   Set aside the same time every evening (mine was 7:30 pm) and practice 
   for 20 minutes. Hold the pen and let your hand and arm relax. I did 
   this night after night for days with absolutely no movement.
  </P>
  <P>
   Two weeks passed with no results. I was determined as I have a 
   stubborn streak. I did notice an occasional electric tingle in my 
   arm. I also discovered that I was really tired after 20 minutes. Now 
   how can you get tired when you are sitting down relaxing?
  </P>
  <P>
   After a few more days, I got a little movement. One night, in very 
   tiny script, my name was written. Then nothing again for days. I had 
   been encouraged when my name had written by itself though and I persisted.
  </P>
  <P>
   One night, something different happened. It had been at least a month 
   of nightly practice. I had started the practice and felt the tingling 
   sensation. Then all at once, the pen began to move, drawing vigorous, 
   overlapping circles. It filled up the paper with overlapping circles 
   of all diameters. I stopped and replaced the paper. Again, the 
   circles until the overlapping lines were densely packed. Another 
   sheet with the same results. I believe I filled up four pages that 
   night until the 20 minutes was completed. I was real tired after the 
   20 minutes but I was excited. I didn't get writing but I did get &quot;something.&quot;
  </P>
  <P>
   The writing did not begin immediately but had started 10 or so 
   minutes into the practice session. When the pen began to move, it was 
   a strong movement and I wasn't doing it. I didn't understand the 
   circles. Based on my interpretation of Lecron's book, I assumed that 
   perhaps the subconscious needed to learn to write like I had 
   consciously learned. You see, I thought this was my subconscious 
   writing. However, the development took off in an unexpected direction.
