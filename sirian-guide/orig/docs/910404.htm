  </P>
  <P>
   On the night of April 4, 1991 while driving to the Ozark UFO 
   Conference, a missing time experience occurred. I cannot say that 
   this was the first missing time experience that has happened in my 
   life, although at the time I was not consciously aware of any. 
   However, this is the first one that was structured in such a manner 
   that it would be difficult to overlook. I feel that it was conducted 
   as a learning experience to demonstrate how easy it is to have such 
   experiences and not remember them or to rationalize them away.
  </P>
  <P>
   There are many people who live a dual life but only remember half of 
   it. The half they don't remember involves interaction with 
   extra-terrestrial beings. I am going to present some details of my 
   missing time experience....
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <B><FONT SIZE=4>PERSONAL BACKGROUND</FONT></B>
  </P>
  <P>
   Let me tell you a little about myself. I am a Masters level 
   Psychologist. I have been in private practice, specializing in 
   Hypnotherapy since 1977. Over the years, I have conducted thousands 
   of hypnosis sessions. I have extensive research experience in Social 
   Psychology, both research design and field experience. I am not a UFO 
   researcher and disagree with the methodology that many UFO 
   researchers employ.
  </P>
  <P>
   My first conscious sighting of a UFO occurred in November of 1975 in 
   central Alabama. I was out planet gazing with a refractor telescope 
   when I saw a dull yellow light moving slowly across the sky. I was 
   able to train the scope on it and when I did, the yellow light 
   disappeared. I saw a dull gray disk, a typical flying saucer, with 
   two red lights and two green lights. After verifying that I did have 
   the yellow object in view, I watched it for a few minutes. I was so 
   impressed with the sighting, I wrote up a description that very night 
   and sent it to the address I had for APRO, the Aerial Phenomena 
   Research Organization. In the next morning paper, in the back 
   sections, there was a small article about an FAA observer in Mobile, 
   Alabama who saw the same thing with the same description and could 
   not identify it. Interestingly, my letter to APRO was returned 
   because the organization had moved and forwarding had expired. Being 
   busy in Graduate School at the time, I did not pursue filing the report.
  </P>
  <P>
   In 1989, I had the urge to attend my first UFO conference, which was 
   the Ozark UFO conference. I had never been to, or even thought about 
   attending, such an event. However, the conference served as, what I 
   call, a triggering event. It set in motion the retrieval of memories 
   that had been buried in my subconscious since childhood. Let me tell 
   you that something is well hidden when you haven't had a clue about 
   it for 35 years.
  </P>
  <P>
   So I can pose this question, &quot;How many of you really know 
   yourselves ?&quot; As a psychologist, a necessity of which is self 
   analysis, I thought I knew myself extremely well. I had no idea that 
   I was leading a double life; that there was a whole aspect of life in 
   which I participated that I couldn't remember. I'm sure there are 
   many people in the audience and among the speakers who also lead this 
   double life. Whether you consciously acknowledge or deny it, does not 
   alter the reality of a dual existence. Perhaps something that I say 
   this evening will serve as a triggering event to help you discover a 
   part of life you didn't know was there.

   <B><FONT SIZE=4>DETAILS of the TRIP</FONT></B>
  </P>
  <P>
   Now I want to tell you about my missing time experience. The drive 
   from my home to Eureka Springs, AR takes about 16.5 hours. On the 
   night of April 4th, 1991, it took me about 18.5 hours.
  </P>
  <P>
   It wasn't until Sunday morning, over 48 hours after the experience, 
   that the realization occurred that it had taken an excessive amount 
   of time to travel to Eureka Springs.
  </P>
  <P>
   My first impulse was to rationalize the missing time away by assuming 
   that I had misread my arrival time. However, I had my wife call our 
   answering machine to leave a message for our teenagers as to how to 
   contact us within 20 minutes of the time we arrived. The machine 
   records the day and time automatically and the message was still on 
   the tape when we got home. We had left Pensacola around 9:00 am 
   Thursday morning; the message was logged on the tape at 4:04 am 
   Friday morning.
  </P>
  <P>
   Thus, I really couldn't rationalize away that there was a large 
   segment of time missing. Since I couldn't remember anything definite 
   happening, I attempted to reconstruct the trip.
  </P>
  <P>
   I had decided to approach Eureka Springs from I-40 using ST RD 23. I 
   had used this road to return from the 1989 conference and had found 
   it better than US 65. As near as I can tell, we were on schedule when 
   we arrived at the ST RD 23 exit. It was about 12:20 am. To my mind I 
   drove continuously after leaving I-40, except for a 10 minute stop 
   for gas, but we didn't get to Eureka Springs until 3:38 am.
  </P>
  <P>
   There were a few unusual things about this segment of the trip. The 
   first was that shortly after leaving I-40, we came upon a police car 
   sitting partially in the road with its blue lights flashing. There 
   appeared to be no one in the car or visible around it. Also, I found 
   it odd because it didn't have to be sitting partially in the road 
   when there was space to pull completely out of traffic. I thought it 
   might be a roadblock to check drivers licenses or that maybe there 
   may have been an accident but there were no indications of anything, 
   including the police.
  </P>
  <P>
   Driving slowly, I passed around the police vehicle and proceeded. We 
   didn't see anybody or any indication as to why the police car was 
   stopped. After this point, things got rather weird. I thought over 
   and over to myself as well as aloud that this trip was taking forever.
  </P>
  <P>
   My wife was looking up at the sky and saying that the Big Dipper 
   constellation was not in the right place. She repeated this comment 
   several times. I never have been one to track the constellations or 
   even identify most of them so I couldn't comment as to whether it was 
   or was not. Also, I couldn't look because it was taking an incredible 
   amount of concentration to drive the car. I asked her why she thought 
   it was not in the right place and she gave me a plausible explanation.
  </P>
  <P>
   As the trip appeared to take longer and longer, I told my wife that 
   this was spooky and that this trip was taking forever. I repeated 
   this a number of times. At this point she was looking at what 
   appeared to be a bright star out the driver's side window. I glanced 
   at it and could see it but again, it was taking every ounce of 
   concentration to drive.
  </P>
  <P>
   Finally we arrived at Huntsville, AR. I'll tell you I was thrilled to 
   see that a local gas station was open at that hour in such a small 
   town. I stopped for gas and we got something to drink. This was 
   approximately 3:05 am. We were there no more than 10 minutes before 
   we resumed our trip to Eureka Springs. We arrived there at 
   approximately 3:38 am. I am sure of this arrival time and is the 
   correct amount of elapsed time to drive the 28 miles from Huntsville 
   to Eureka Springs.
  </P>
  <P>
   The missing time sequence appears to have occurred on ST RD 23 
   between I-40 and Huntsville. It should not have taken two hours and 
   forty minutes to drive 50 miles. As a matter of fact, I drove that 
   route to the conference this year and it took exactly one hour to 
   drive from I-40 to Huntsville. I was trying to maintain 55 mph and 
   being unfamiliar with the road, I did take some of the curves a bit 
   too fast. However, even if we add 10 minutes to the trip to negotiate 
   the curves, that still leaves one hour and thirty minutes<b> missing</b>.
  </P>
  <P>
   I could not consciously recall what happened during that missing 
   segment of time because to my mind, I never stopped driving. Whatever 
   happened, I had no anxiety from it and had no repulsion upon 
   re-traveling the route on the way home. I decided to have a hypnosis 
   regression session to see if I could find out what happened. (Yes, I 
   do use the process for my benefit also)
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <B><FONT SIZE=4>A SUMMARY OF WHAT WAS LEARNED FROM THE HYPNOSIS SESSION</FONT></B>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <B><FONT SIZE=4>ABOUT THE MISSING TIME</FONT></B>
  </P>
  <P>
   On April 10, 1991, I had a hypnosis session to retrieve information 
   about the missing time experience. Retrieving this information was 
   extremely difficult. At this point, I am going to present a summary 
   of the session.
  </P>
  <P>
   An encounter with extra-terrestrials occurred. This encounter was 
   conducted so that it would be noticed as a demonstration of how easy 
   it is to overlook missing time experiences.
  </P>
  <P>
   Within ten or fifteen minutes after leaving the interstate I 
   encountered a police car. It was just sitting there with its blue 
   lights on. There was nobody around it. It was rather difficult to see 
   inside of it. I didn't see anybody.
  </P>
  <P>
   When I saw it there I thought that maybe they were having a license 
   check or something although it was rather late to do so. Then I 
   thought perhaps there had been an accident. However, nothing was 
   evident but the police car with its blue lights flashing.
  </P>
  <P>
   The road was a little bit higher than the shoulder. The police car 
   was on the right side of the road, same side we were traveling down. 
   Over on the right side at that spot, there were a few small trees and 
   it looked rather flat behind it. It seems that in recall, somewhere 
   in this area, there was a dirt road that we got off on.
  </P>
  <P>
   I see the vehicle, a flying disk, sitting on relatively flat ground. 
   It looks like the one I've seen in past regression sessions with a 
   ramp coming down from it. Standing by the ramp are a man and a woman. 
   The disk is fairly large; about 25 feet in diameter.
  </P>
  <P>
   I drive down this dirt road a little bit. It doesn't appear to be an 
   extremely long one. I'm not really sure where it was in relation to 
   the police car. It just seemed to be somewhere in the vicinity.
  </P>
  <P>
   So it seems I told my wife that, &quot;You finally got your conscious experience.&quot;
  </P>
  <P>
   It seems like she says, &quot;Yeah, but I'll never remember it later 
   because the perception thing has already shifted.&quot;
  </P>
  <P>
   The duality [of consciousness] is beginning to manifest because there 
   was no real emotion associated with the experience.
  </P>
  <P>
   The man and the woman standing by the ramp are ones I've seen many 
   times in the past.
  </P>
  <P>
   So I park the car and shut it off, shut the lights off and everything.
  </P>
  <P>
   Underneath the craft is a pulsating green glow.
  </P>
  <P>
   We get out and walk towards the craft and are greeted by these people.
  </P>
  <P>
   The woman seems to say that, &quot;We have arranged the experience 
   that you desired.&quot;
  </P>
  <P>
   By this time the duality [of consciousness] is strongly setting in.
  </P>
  <P>
   We all go into the saucer and they close the door, retract the ramp, 
   whatever, I don't know how that works. Apparently the thing takes 
   off, although it is just very smooth. And there are some other human 
   people on board, people that I consciously know, in addition to the crew.
  </P>
  <P>
   There seems to be two pilots, two men in silver suits. They are 
   sitting at a console with a monitor, a large flat screen monitor. 
   They are watching the monitor closely.
  </P>
  <P>
   There is a round spot on the floor that you can see through, see the 
   ground. The saucer is flying through the mountains.
  </P>
  <P>
   The two pilots operate the console and observe the view on the flat 
   screen monitor which appears to be like the forward view, in other 
   words, like a windshield almost, except it's not a windshield, it is 
   a view screen.
  </P>
  <P>
   So what was the point of the meeting ?
  </P>
  <P>
   One point was the conscious cues that it had occurred.
  </P>
  <P>
   It served as an indicator in time that contact had occurred in a 
   manner that was difficult to deny even though my conscious self has 
   tried to rationalize it all away. But it's pretty hard to rationalize 
   away a sixteen and a half hour trip taking eighteen and a half hours.
  </P>
  <P>
   It appears that measure for measure, the positive extra-terrestrials 
   are countering the negative extra-terrestrials.
  </P>
  <P>
   Each of us received information relevant to what we needed to do.
  </P>
  <P>
   We flew a great distance. It seems like we went over to Egypt to the 
   Great Pyramid complex. It was like the big pyramid was transparent. 
   Two thirds down from the top. it was like a sun in there. Brilliant, 
   pure, golden energy.
  </P>
  <P>
   Then we went over to Britain and hovered at a point over the English 
   channel where we could see both the British Isles and the continent. 
   Through the floor viewer, we could see electromagnetic concentrations 
   as being a blue color, medium bright blue.
  </P>
  <P>
   Then we flew across the Atlantic and hovered over New England 
   briefly. Then we went back to the landing site. It was impressed upon 
   me that there was something for me to find there.
  </P>
  <P>
   After returning, in the altered state that I was in, I drove pretty 
   slow. After stopping in Huntsville, I was able to drive normally on 
   to Eureka Springs.
  </P>

   <B><FONT SIZE=4>CONCLUSION</FONT></B>
  </P>
  <P>
   The thing I found most interesting about the Missing Time experience 
   was the extensive rationalizations that my mind constructed to 
   explain it away. After there was no doubt that approximately two 
   hours were missing, the feeling was WOW but the WOW faded quickly. 
   Some strange things happened for several days after we returned home. 
   As for the missing time, within a couple of days, it was just another 
   experience that was never mentioned.
  </P>
  <P>
   Two of the people that I recognized on the saucer, had similar 
   memories to mine of the experience.
  </P>
  <P>
   I learned from the experience that it is easy <b>not to notice</b> 
   missing time. You can have multiple experiences and literally not 
   notice them.<br>&nbsp;
