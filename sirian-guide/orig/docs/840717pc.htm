   <FONT SIZE=4>AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL VIEW OF CREATION - PART SIX</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>PRESENTED JULY 17, 1984</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>My dear children and beloved colleagues, tonight we 
   shall continue the saga of the creation of man. If you will recall 
   from the last time, two separate phases of the overall project were 
   in progress simultaneously. That which we refer to as the Martian 
   Project and the development on the planet Earth.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Tonight we shall attempt to put this information in more 
   detail; in terms of filtering out the INFECTED ONES, the Martian 
   Project was the secondary stage and the development on Earth was a 
   tertiary or end product.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The Earth part was more difficult than that of the 
   Martian Project because life had to be created from the planet itself 
   in order to be assured that once the INFECTED ONES were incarnated on 
   the planet, they would not be able to go out of the Solar System.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And so a specific team was assigned to develop the most 
   suitable body or vehicle to house the INFECTED ONES and to accomplish 
   the purpose of keeping them fixated on the planet Earth.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The Martian phase of the project was designed to serve 
   as a step-down transformer so that the INFECTED ONES that inhabited 
   the higher vibration alien bodies would be altered enough to where 
   they couldn't get back into those alien bodies. And at the same time 
   be altered sufficiently so that they could eventually inhabit the 
   bodies that were being prepared for them on the Earth.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>If you will recall it was said that the planet Mars was 
   much like the planet Earth at this time, which is approximately 
   4,750,000 years ago. The orbit of the planet Mars as well as it's 
   size is similar to the Earth's; the Martian day being just a bit 
   longer. Thus, it was quite suited to serve as a step-down for the 
   INFECTED ONES to eventually inhabit what is now referred to as human bodies.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Large cities were constructed on the planet Mars, but 
   great care was taken so that the INFECTED ONES in alien bodies would 
   not be aware of such structures until the time was right.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In the meantime, a great deal of difficulty was 
   encountered in the creation of the various life forms on the planet 
   Earth; many unsuitable forms were created. The environment of the 
   Earth at this time was quite suitable for the proliferation of 
   whatever life forms were created. As was mentioned before, all types 
   of plant life had existed on the Earth and, except for animal life 
   forms, you could say that it was a paradise.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The orbit of the planet was such that the extreme polar 
   regions were much smaller than they occupy in the present time. The 
   orbit was stable, smooth and symmetrical so there was very little, if 
   any, variation of seasons; a particular spot on the globe maintained 
   the same climate year around. This lack of adversity allowed the new 
   creations to grow and expand much better than anticipated.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>One of the greatest problems initially was 
   over-population as each new life form was created and nurtured. There 
   was no check or balance system yet inaugurated and you could say that 
   nature went wild and deviated along several different lines. One of 
   the biggest variations that is most noted by your science today is 
   the extreme size that some of the creatures reached. Everything, 
   every creature, was very large and this was allowed to continue for 
   the time. There was no need to reverse that trend and the lack of 
   climatic adversity supported such mutations. As each type of life 
   form was created and turned loose, it flourished. Each that was 
   created was more complex than what it was created from. It was done 
   by altering the structure of the chromosomes; the RNA and DNA 
   factors. And each succeeding life form served as the foundation for 
   the creation of the next variation.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This was done, as has been mentioned, to tie the bodies 
   that would become human to this planet; to have a close exclusive 
   relationship between them and the planet. This is why the ancient 
   teachings, the ancient writings, say that man was created from the 
   dust or the mud; this is simply saying that man was created from the 
   elements of the planet.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This creation process took an extreme amount of Earth 
   time. The Sirian volunteers as well as the incarnated creators used 
   up a goodly number of Sirian vehicles in the process. They had 
   continuity of consciousness and other than swapping bodies or 
   vehicles, if you will, never lost consciousness.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>That which became man was created last. It was the 
   epitome of the creation chain and the life form that could be 
   classified as a human in a sense was first manifested 3,000,000 years 
   ago. However this life form was not suitable. It did not appear this 
   way initially and so the Martian phase had already been implemented 
   before it was discovered that the new vehicle would not be suitable. 
   Bear in mind that this was a trial and error process, something that 
   had never been done before. It was engineering not only genetics but 
   consciousness also.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And so the Martian phase was put into operation. If you 
   will recall the clones, the vehicles without consciousnesses, were 
   created and stored on the base at the planet Jupiter; many millions 
   of them were created in this period of time. It was decided that it 
   would be best to have a lot of extras rather than not enough. These 
   vehicles were ferried to the planet Mars and stored there awaiting 
   final activation.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The plan was as follows: The vehicles would be set up on 
   the planet and they were magnetized in such away that if any non-physical
    approached them, they would instantly become incarnated; locked into 
   the physical. The creators had a great number of INFECTED ONES 
   contained and they were to serve as the initial animators of the 
   Martian population. But it was also important to pull in those 
   INFECTED ONES that inhabited the alien vehicles in the Pleiades and 
   the other Solar System not yet named on the other side of the Galaxy.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>At this point we shall pause in the tale and take it up 
   at our next transmission. My blessings upon each and everyone of you; 
   go in peace; go in love. Seek your purpose and fulfill it. So Be It.</FONT>
