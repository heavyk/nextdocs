            <p>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=3>Dear children and beloved colleagues it is I, Kuthumi. I 
   come to speak to you tonight on a topic that is of vital concern, a 
   topic that is one of great value to each of you and to humanity as a 
   whole. This is the topic of the <B>life energies</B>. As has been 
   mentioned many times in the past the<B> life energies</B> are the 
   most powerful force in the Universe. They are indeed an emanation 
   from the <B>source</B>: they are the creators: the motivators: the animators.</FONT>
<br>   <br><FONT SIZE=3>The <B>source's</B> energy is differentiated into seven 
   frequencies; each frequency a mixture as well as a pure emanation. 
   For most of you it has been said many times that the energies were 
   not to be trifled with; were not to be taken lightly. This is because 
   of their great power.</FONT>
  <br><br><FONT SIZE=3>In your present technological state, man has devised the 
   means of releasing energy by destroying matter in the form of the 
   atom. The nature of the life energies are even more powerful but they 
   resonate in harmony with creation. Each of you serve as channels for 
   this life force, as each consciousness is motivated and animated by 
   the life force. ...... As .... energy flows, if it is not dealt with 
   properly, physical consequences can result, as well as emotional 
   consequences. Many of you are discovering this now. Much has been 
   said in the past concerning the nature of this energy. It is time for 
   those here that are unaware to be educated as to the nature of the 
   energy and the dealing with the energy. It is also time to use the 
   energy to prevent it from back logging causing the various side effects.<br></FONT>

            <p>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=3>One of the greatest side effects of blocked restrictive 
   energy flow is illness. You see that which you call microbes, 
   bacteria, viruses in reality have no life as such. They are the 
   creation of the psyche. Yes, each succeeding generation creates their 
   own group of microbes and viruses to serve only one purpose: 
   punishment, self punishment to assuage guilt feelings. We can go down 
   through the ages and site numerous historical references to support 
   this contention. For example: the Bubonic Plague or Black Death of 
   the Middle Ages, the Great Influenza Epidemic during the years of 
   World War One, the persuasiveness of polio after that period of time 
   and increasingly cancer and a new one which is not new, but it is a 
   unique creation that is referred to as A.I.D.S. Let us not forget 
   Legionnaires disease either. Yes, the collective consciousness of 
   humanity is creating these diseases and the life energies are being 
   channeled into their perpetuation.</FONT>
  </p>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Have you ever noticed the trend that as one major 
   ailment is conquered another rises to take its place? Think about 
   this and you shall see that it is true. The Great Influenza Epidemic 
   of the World War One years has never been repeated. It was situations 
   specific. It was created by the consciousness of the generation but 
   [ck] killed millions of people and then passed on, yet the microbes 
   or the germs if you will, still exist; they are still as prevalent 
   today as they were then. But the results are not the same because the 
   focus has changed. Health is directly related to the mind and the 
   power of the anti-self.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The physical body is a multitude of consciousness. It is 
   in a true sense a multi faceted organism. Each cell has a 
   consciousness. Each physical body is like a Universe unto itself and 
   you the spirit which inhabits this Universe are as a god. When the 
   god is displeased with itself, illness results in the Universe with 
   the potential for the destruction of that Universe. The transition of death.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It has been pointed out on more than one occasion that a 
   person's attitude determines how long they live and how healthy they 
   are as they live. ...........................</FONT>
