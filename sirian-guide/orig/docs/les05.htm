   <FONT SIZE=4>CENTERS WITHIN THE ETHERIC</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Before getting into the various centers, let us review 
   the function of the etheric vehicle.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>From the soul or SELF viewpoint, the etheric is the 
   vehicle of importance upon the physical plane. The gross body which 
   you see with physical eyesight is an automaton depending totally upon 
   the etheric for life. Also recall that the etheric is principally 
   upon the 4th subplane.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Mun has seven main centers of energy reception, although 
   the seven will differ at different stages of evolution.</FONT>

   <FONT SIZE=3>The preceding is the seven major centers throughout 
   huMUNity in general. When MUN enters the path, the centers below the 
   HEART center send their energy into the HEART center or to those 
   centers above it.</FONT>

   <FONT SIZE=3>Earth Top(at 3rd initiation)</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As the MUN progresses further there is a center that 
   develops between the THROAT and HEART centers, approximately between 
   the shoulder blades, which is a temporary nexus for energy flow. It 
   goes into quiescence when all the head centers are operating. We will 
   call this one the NEXUS center. It serves as a point of intersection 
   for energies coming from the HEART and EARTH centers, going out each 
   hand or into the AJNA center.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Still further along the path, the ALTA MAJOR center 
   becomes active. It is associated with the carotid gland. When the 
   ALTA MAJOR, AJNA and TOP centers become active; what is known as the 
   THIRD EYE becomes functional.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>MUN often confuses the THIRD EYE and the AJNA center. 
   The former is located between the eyes just above the nose and the 
   latter is higher on the forehead. The THIRD EYE and the AJNA center 
   are on a line perpendicular to one that would be drawn through the eyes.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When MUN has completed his MUNship or his evolution as a 
   MUN all centers are shifted to their analogies within the head.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>FUNCTIONS OF THE CENTERS</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The EARTH or KUNDALINI center is the connection to the 
   life endowed in substance itself (sometimes called fire by friction, 
   third logos, third aspect of the trinity, manas &amp;c.) We will call 
   it the energy of the THIRD ASPECT/RAY which is endowed in substance itself.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>For a long period of evolution, this energy is a 
   trickle; only allowing enough to keep the physical vehicle alive. It 
   forms a large flat coil around the base of the spine. Relative to the 
   physical vehicle, this coil covers the whole buttock area and is the 
   primary that powers the &quot;pole&quot; (spine) which stands in its 
   center.(Another tidbit for you lovers of the Tesla coil and other 
   energy devices) As the path is paced, this coil draws more current 
   from the planet and begins spreading its energy to various centers. 
   At the consummation of the third initiation, (The initiations will be 
   discussed in the following section) this energy has been combined 
   with the SECOND ASPECT/RAY within the consciousness of the MUN. This 
   brings down the &quot;fire&quot; from the MONAD which is of the FIRST 
   ASPECT/RAY. Thus, MUN becomes a conscious, functioning MONAD on the 
   physical plane.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The above description is the process that AGNI YOGA is 
   to teach; the union of the three fires (fire by friction [energy from 
   the earth] = THIRD ASPECT/RAY, solar fire [energy from the soul] = 
   SECOND ASPECT/RAY, and cosmic fire [energy from the monad] = FIRST 
   ASPECT/RAY) within MUN. The perfected MUN! This is the process that 
   we are to bring to you.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Blessed be! It has taken so long to be able to get 
   huMUNity ready; to get a unit within huMUNity to respond to the 
   message and be willing to participate in the exercises. And then pass 
   it on to others. We of the Sirian Cortege thank you for allowing us 
   to present this system to you. Your participation; your putting forth 
   the time and effort that is required, has allowed us to bring this 
   through and it will allow it to be presented to huMUNity at large, 
   shortly. We desire that each of you realize that you are performing a 
   vital service for huMUNity and your planet by your participation. 
   Thank you.</FONT>

  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Now for a brief description of the other centers.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The SACRAL center is the center of creativity until MUN 
   paces the path. Its use is that of continuity of the race. When MUN 
   treads the path, he begins to use this energy consciously and it then 
   is transferred to the THROAT center.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The SOLAR PLEXUS center is a massive connection onto the 
   bottom 3 1/2 subplanes of the astral plane. When MUN becomes 
   considerate of those around him and treads the path, this energy is 
   transferred into the HEART center which originates on the BUDDHIC 
   plane and comes through the top 3 1/2 subplanes of the ASTRAL.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The HEART center is used to influence huMUNity and is 
   the center through which the love or the SECOND ASPECT/RAY is radiated.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The THROAT center is used in creative activities.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The AGNA center combines the HEART and THROAT energies 
   within the SECOND RAY and projects this creative energy onto the 
   physical. It combines the SACRAL, THROAT and AJNA for the THIRD RAY. 
   But that belongs to the science of triangles or TRIADS which we will 
   get into later. It also relates the spiritual triad to the life of 
   the personality and is the SECOND RAY center within the head. 
   Therefore it is a very important center for all.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The TOP center, or top of the head, or crown center is 
   the seat of the MONAD and is the FIRST RAY center connected with the head.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The ALTA MAJOR center is the THIRD RAY center within the 
   head. It comes into functioning between the second and third initiations.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>There are other secondary centers that we will go into 
   as the need arises, and you can add them to your diagram.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>INITIATIONS</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>An initiation is a consciousness expansion event that 
   has permanent effects upon the entities equipment. Within the earth 
   system there are nine such graduated steps for the huMUN to go through.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The ceremony occurs on the nonphysical levels. The 
   candidate is presented to the initiator by two advanced huMUN type 
   entities and one deva. A burst of energy is passed through the 
   representatives and then into the initiate for lasting consciousness expansion.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The first initiation is where the huMUN realizes that 
   there is more to living than satisfying his physical desires and he 
   steps upon the path.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The second initiation is where MUN has decided that 
   fulfillment can come only from doing for others and he so often 
   becomes a &quot;busy-body do-gooder&quot;.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The third initiation is where the soul takes complete 
   control of the personality and MUN is not controlled by the 
   elementals within the vehicles. They still try to tempt the individual.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The fourth initiation is where the MONAD takes complete 
   control of the personality, the veil between spirit and matter is 
   destroyed and MUN has direct access to his spirit.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Further information on the initiations will be presented 
   in the future.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>RITUAL OF LIVING</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As the Soul takes control of its outer form, its life 
   and all events, it holds the personality accountable for time 
   allotted to it.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Whether or not you have ever considered this - day to 
   day life is a ritual and best performed rhythmically.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>You arise at some point everyday relative to the 
   rotation of the earth - another ritual - and you release your 
   consciousness at some point in the night. Both of these ritualistic 
   activities are dependent upon the ritual(rhythm and order imposed 
   upon you by the sun and the earth).</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Many of you, as the majority of MUNkind, are mostly 
   involved in economic pursuit in order to maintain money (which is 
   etheric energy) for the ritual of modern living.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>You become so involved within the form of the ritual (of 
   modern existence) that you forget the purpose behind it. And for many 
   the result (money) becomes the purpose. That is the cart before the 
   horse, but it has been intentionally distorted by our Cosmic 
   challengers (and here, I am being diplomatic). May I digress here and 
   say that so often our strongest points and our models for 
   accomplishing &quot;good&quot; are used against us.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>One is allotted a certain amount of time everyday in 
   which he works. After that, the use of the time left is up to the 
   person and his angel(soul).</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Within the ritual of living, one should allot time for 
   physical, emotional, mental and soul to re-create balance and harmony 
   within and amongst themselves. Recreation is or should be a ritual of re-creation.</FONT>
