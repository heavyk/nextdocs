   EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL INTERVENTION: HYBRIDS, GENETIC ENGINEERING AND THE 
   SECRET LIFE
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Extra-terrestrials exist. There is too much documented 
   evidence, too many witnesses, for any rational person to think 
   otherwise. This is a brief summary of the extra-terrestrial groups.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   There are three different categories of extra-terrestrials as defined 
   by myself. The bad guys, the little gray aliens, are the ones you 
   always hear about in most presentations. They abduct and exploit 
   humans. The good guys, called the Peacekeepers, are ones you rarely 
   hear about, perhaps because they look human rather than humanoid, 
   thus, not visually exciting; also contact with them is more difficult 
   to remember and the memories are more difficult to retrieve. I will 
   explain this memory difficulty shortly. With some of the human 
   looking alien civilizations, one could be sitting next to you right 
   at this moment and you wouldn't know they were an extra-terrestrial.
  </P>
  <P>
   The Peacekeepers prevent the bad guys from running rampant exploiting 
   humanity and earth.
  </P>
  <P>
   The final group is composed of disinterested extra-terrestrial 
   civilizations. I call them tourists. This type passes through from 
   time to time and sometimes picks up a human for study. However, it is 
   nothing more than curiosity and they are aware of the planetary 
   rules; human returned unharmed.
  </P>
  <P>
   In all the years I have been attending these conferences, all you 
   hear about are the gray aliens, alien hardware that might exist, 
   abductions, sliced-up livestock and to some extent, hybrids. Never 
   what it all means or what is going on. <B>Today, you are going to 
   hear what is going on from a new perspective. You are going to learn 
   about the neglected aspect of the extra-terrestrial equation; the Peacekeepers.</B>
  </P>
  <P>
   In the short amount of time that I have to speak, I cannot do the 
   subject justice. However, I will talk fast.
  </P>
  <P>
   The story has to begin with fairly modern human history but the good 
   guys have been watching over mankind for a long time and the bad guys 
   have been trying to exploit mankind for a long time. There is a 
   planetary charter enforced by a consortium of powerful 
   extraterrestrial civilizations that states No extra-terrestrial 
   civilization can exploit or directly control humanity.
  </P>
  <P>
   The Peacekeepers' task is to enforce this planetary policy. The 
   loophole in the policy is that anything that has an aspect of human 
   or earth in it is considered a part of earth. The Peacekeepers 
   realized that eventually the gray aliens would figure this out and 
   make their move to integrate themselves into humans as soon as human 
   technology reached the point where they could do so. The key factor 
   is that humans had to provide the means; human knowledge and 
   technology had to evolve to a point that the gray aliens could 
   utilize it for their agenda. The charter specifically prohibits 
   extra-terrestrials from officially providing hardware. They can tell 
   you about, even tell you how to build it, but they can't do it for you.
  </P>
  <P>
   Anticipating this move the Peacekeepers began following genetic lines 
   of human families between 350-400 years ago to find suitable host 
   vehicles to counteract the threat from the gray aliens when the time 
   arrived. Although 400 years sounds like a long time, the average life 
   span of a Peacekeeper extra-terrestrial is 10,000 earth years.
  </P>
  <P>
   The reason for the gray alien hybridization program is that they are 
   a dying civilization. Currently, they live a few hundred earth years 
   although in times past, they lived much longer. Around 15,000 years 
   ago, they lived 1200-2000 earth years. This has been rapidly 
   declining. With their reproductive capacity failing and their 
   longevity diminishing, the only hope they have of continuing their 
   civilization is by creating a viable hybrid with a human. The gray 
   aliens want this planet for their own. If their hybridization 
   programs succeeds, they will fulfill the loophole and have a more 
   superior being than humans but being part human, the planetary 
   policy, and the enforcement associated with it, does not apply.
  </P>
  <P>
   The Peacekeepers solution to this problem is genetically engineered 
   humans who will counteract the gray hybrids when it becomes 
   necessary. Thus, an alien hybrid will not be allowed to dominate 
   humanity because they will be neutralized by a superior, human being 
   that exceeds the capacity of the typical gray alien.
  </P>
  <P>
   It needs to be mentioned that the least sophisticated 
   extra-terrestrial is vastly superior to a human. This superiority can 
   take the form of physical strength but usually does not. The alien 
   technology is superior and their personal electro-magnetic field is 
   so strong that capacities that humans call extra-sensory, such as 
   telepathy and telekinesis, is routine for the average alien. Some do 
   it naturally, others use technology to boost inherent abilities; 
   abilities that humans also have dormant within them.
  </P>
  <P>
   A point I would like to make is that both the Peacekeepers and the 
   gray aliens have bases on earth, usually in general proximity to each 
   other. The Peacekeepers tend to have their earth bases inside of 
   mountains. The gray aliens, have their bases underground or 
   underwater. The level of technology is a deciding factor. The 
   Peacekeepers have an incredible technology and can create bases 
   inside of mountains that have no access unless you dematerialize the 
   rock to get into them. The gray aliens have actually had to have 
   humans build their bases for them.
  </P>
  <P>
   In summary, there are three classes of extra-terrestrials consisting 
   of a number of different civilizations from numerous solar systems in 
   this galaxy, associating with the planet earth. The good guys act as 
   Peacekeepers preventing primitive humans from being exploited. The 
   bad guys, as represented by the gray aliens, are the ones that go 
   around slicing up live stock, an occasional human and doing the 
   abductions that you have heard so much about. Finally, a third class, 
   which I call tourists, have some degree of curiosity about human 
   beings and some degree of contact with them on a research basis.
  </P>
  <P>
   This summary would not be complete without making a definitive 
   statement. The Roswell, New Mexico incident, actually one of several 
   in the Southwest in 1947, DID OCCUR!
  </P>
  <P>
   These crashes were not accidents. They were a direct result of a 
   confrontation between the gray aliens and the Peacekeepers. The 
   Peacekeepers selected remote locations for the confrontations to 
   prevent injury to humans. The Peacekeepers selected land sites to 
   send a message to the humans. I will explain that shortly.
  </P>
  <P>
   Those craft that crashed were shot down, and believe me, the US 
   military, or no other military on earth, has the capacity to confront 
   even the most primitive extra-terrestrial in 1947 or the present.
  </P>
  <P>
   Those crashed vehicles in 1947, as I mentioned, were shot down. It 
   was no accident that they were in the United States. You see, the US 
   inherited more than just the Nazis scientists after World War 2, they 
   assumed the alliance with the gray aliens as well. The Peacekeepers 
   were sending a message to those humans foolish enough to embrace the 
   gray aliens; you may be impressed with gray technology but we can 
   destroy it anytime we want. The Peacekeepers have continued to 
   destroy gray aliens that have violated the planetary charter. These 
   battles, although not frequent, take place from time to time. Some 
   people tend to interpret them as thunderstorms due to the nature of 
   the weapons. A battle took place over the Gulf of Mexico in the late 1980s.
  </P>
  <P>
   In 1947, and whenever possible, some agency of the US government 
   recovered the vehicles and bodies. I would like to point out that 
   there was a response team who was very well aware of what they were 
   doing and very well practiced at retrieving these vehicles and 
   silencing the local population. If you read the descriptions of the 
   threats made against the witnesses of Roswell and it reminds you of 
   tactics of the Nazis, you are right on target.
  </P>
  <P>
   The purpose of retrieving the hardware and dead aliens was to support 
   their new allies by keeping them secret and to find out more about 
   them. After all, no self respecting, live gray alien would allow 
   himself to be disected. Also, getting the hardware indirectly was a 
   loophole too. The humans hoped that they might be able to repair the 
   equipment with the technical advice of the gray's and use it, gaining 
   centuries of technical advancement for quick use. I don't believe it 
   has worked too well due to lack of human technology to implement the 
   advice of the grays. As I say, they can tell you about Zook, they can 
   demonstrate a Zook, they can tell you how they build a Zook, but they 
   can't build a Zook for a human. It is ironic that the gray agenda is 
   hampered by the very beings they wish to control.
  </P>
  <P>
   It is interesting that the witnesses to the Roswell situation were 
   confronted with an issue of national security. The only reason to 
   keep knowledge of the gray aliens a secret for national security 
   would be to hide the alliance that some element of the United States 
   had with them. Perhaps the humans behind this alliance were afraid 
   that every other country would want their own gray alien alliance so 
   they wanted to keep it secret. Of course, the gray aliens have made 
   alliances with whatever human governments they feel will suit their 
   agenda. It is likely that Saddam's admiration of Hitler also includes 
   a gray association.
  </P>
  <P>
   You've heard about the gray alien hybrids many times at these 
   conferences. The gray alien hybrid program began in 1930 with an 
   alliance formed with Hitler which empowered the Nazis regime. I have 
   a great deal of detail related to this alliance but probably won't 
   have time to present it due to time constraints. If I have time, I 
   will give you the history beginning in 1930 with the Nazis. However, 
   the genetic engineering of the Peacekeepers is more important and I 
   will focus mainly on that aspect.
