<TITLE>Life After Death: Knowledge to Dispel Fear - Part 4 by DK</TITLE>
<META name="description" content="In 1985, Djwhal Kuhl, known to many as DK, presented a series of channeled lectures on a topic that most people would prefer not to think about...death. As he so aptly pointed out, it is an experience that everyone without exception will eventually face. The intent of these lectures was to emphasize that life is eternal and what we believe in life determines what we will experience in the afterlife. The message is clear, death is not to be feared, it is a change. It is not an end, it is a beginning.">

  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Greetings to you along the path. it is I D.K., tonight 
   we shall continue our discussion of life after death. We have been 
   debating among ourselves as to the most appropriate information to 
   present at this time. The choice is between discussing belief 
   structures and discussing possibilities that the entity will 
   encounter immediately upon departing the physical vehicle at the 
   passing over. Perhaps we shall present a synthesis of the two.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As we have discussed in this series Western Society has 
   little preparation for the most dramatic and traumatic event that one 
   faces in life, that which is referred to as death. This lack of 
   preparation creates many hindrances, unnecessary difficulties in the 
   evolutionary path of the evolving consciousness.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The entire orientation of how Western Society views the 
   death experience needs to be altered. Death is not something to be 
   feared. It is not something that you elude most of your life but 
   which finally catches up with you. The death experience is a change, 
   a necessary step in the continuing path back to the source. A healthy 
   attitude towards the topic needs to be developed, this needs to begin 
   at a early age.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>One must analyze why we feel badly when someone we know 
   departs physical existence. If this is analyzed it will readily be 
   discovered that it is a personal ego oriented desires that make us 
   feel badly about the departure of another. We will miss that person, 
   that person is not around to be our friend or our loved one. That 
   person cannot fulfill our needs, this is what creates the majority of 
   the grief experience. The grief experience serves no useful purpose 
   for either those still living or the departed one. An entire a 
   complete reorientation of attitudes towards the death experience 
   needs to be implemented.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Death should be viewed simply as a change, simply as an 
   alteration another run of the ladder in the endless staircase leading 
   back to the source. It should not be viewed as a loss or should not 
   be viewed as a calamity; it should not be viewed as a sad experience. 
   Physical existence is but a classroom and as with most classes they 
   must end for a new class to take it's place.</FONT>
