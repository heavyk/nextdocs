    <FONT COLOR="#00007F"><br>The two voice clip recordings took place within 
    15 feet of where the Union attack stalled. In a desperate attempt to 
    reach their objectives, Union troops at this point began digging a 
    tunnel in an attempt to get explosives at the edge of the Confederate 
    defenses however, the Confederates withdrew before the tunnel was 
    completed.. The small tunnel still remains and has a memorial built 
    around the enterance. (See Photo 1)</FONT>

    towards treeline. The stream is about 20 feet inside the treeline.</FONT>
