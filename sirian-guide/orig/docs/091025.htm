            <p>The following series is a recounting of paranormal experiences 
            I've had throughout my life. &nbsp;I offer them to you, for the 
            fun of reading a good ghost story.<br><br>I have never sought to 
            &quot;prove&quot; them, and could care less about so called scientific 
            proof. &nbsp;To the experiencer, the event is proof enough!<br></p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;With wooden doors open and windows raised, we welcomed 
            the warmth that spring evening in 1971. &nbsp;We had quest for dinner 
            and my niece, Jose, was staying over night. &nbsp;A festive mood 
            pervaded the house, music played, my husband, four year-old son 
            and guests barbequed on the patio.</p>
            <p>I noticed Jose hurrying from the quest room, then slowing as 
            she neared me in the kitchen. </p>
            <p>&quot;Would you come into my room, for a minute,&quot; she asked 
            hesitantly.</p>
            <p>&quot;Of course, just let me set this pan off the stove.&quot;</p>
            <p>Inside her room I asked, &quot;What's the matter?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Just listen.&quot;</p>
            <p>We did. &nbsp;It only took a few moments. &nbsp;Pinging began 
            on the glass of the window, even though no glass was exposed to 
            the outside. A screen separated the glass windows from the outside.</p>
            <p>I didn't know what was doing it, but my main concern was keeping 
            the fourteen year old calm. &nbsp;We, my family and I, were accustom 
            to strange events, but this child wasn't.</p>
            <p>&quot;It's probably bugs.&quot; &nbsp;I told her. &nbsp;&quot;I'll 
            lower the inside window, that'll block the sound and then I'll check 
            the outside for you.&quot; &nbsp;I only did this to make her feel 
            more secure.</p>
            <p>I lowered the window then headed for the outside. &nbsp;Jose 
            dogged my heels. &nbsp;Outside we found no bugs - just nothing around 
            her window.</p>
            <p>She gained enough confidence to go back to her room, and I went 
            back to cooking. &nbsp;Less than thirty minutes, she was back and 
            her face was white.</p>
            <p>&quot;Come listen now.&quot; &nbsp;She whispered to me.</p>
            <p>This time there were bangs on the glass window. &nbsp;How it 
            kept from splintering, I do not know.</p>
            <p>&quot;Jose, come help me in the kitchen.&quot;</p>
            <p>She did. &nbsp;All settled down. &nbsp;We ate, joked and had 
            a pleasant time.</p>
            <p>Jose and I were cleaning-up, both standing by the sink, when 
            appeared head-high in front of us, a blue and white paper cup. &nbsp;It 
            casually curved around us and just as casually sank to the floor 
            spilling not one drop of the liquid it contained that looked like 
            iced tea.</p>
            <p>We looked at each other. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>&quot;Well,&quot; I said, not being able to think of any plausible 
            explanation, there being no blue and white paper cups in the house 
            and no tea. &quot;Would you like some tea?&quot;</p>
            <p>She fled back to the quest room and closed the door.</p>
            <p>She would have gone home right then, but her parents were out 
            of town. &nbsp;I sat up all night with her. &nbsp;She left the next 
            morning as soon as she found another relative to stay with.&nbsp;</p>
