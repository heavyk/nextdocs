In 1968, Erich von Daniken published <B>Chariots of the Gods?</B>
   This ground breaking book presented, for the first time on a wide
   scale basis, photographic evidence of extra-terrestrial contact with
   Earth in the distant past. In 1974, NBC television presented <B>In
   Search of Ancient Astronauts</B>, showing much of the photographic
   evidence presented by von Daniken.
  </P>
  <P>
   Of course, he was, and continues to be attacked for going against the
   established presentation of history by showing a worldwide connection
   between drawings, buildings and large scale images that, primitive
   humans as defined by the establishment, would never have been able to
   accomplish. The same gigantic structures and images separated by
   thousands of miles and on different continents.
  </P>
  <P>
   In many, many books since 1968, von Daniken presents the photographic
   evidence with his conjectures. If you never read the text, the
   photographs alone are most revealing.
  </P>
  <P>
   <B>Arrival of the Gods: Revealing the Alien Landing Sites of Nazca</B>,
    just for the photographs alone, is a very worthwhile purchase. It
   has many color, high detailed photographs of drawings and designs
   that are so large, they can only be seen from the air; in some cases,
   from a considerable height. It also has a number of pictures of
   ancient figures, estimated to be 80-100,000 years old that show some
   astounding images.
  </P>
  <P>
   When you look at the numerous photographs of the South American
   region, it is clear why the establishment wants the dots not to be
   connected. The giant figures could not have been created by primitive people.
  </P>
  <P>
   Whether you agree with von Daniken's views or not, it is clear that
   history as presented by the establishment, is not accurate. Since
   academia and science know about all the information presented by von
   Daniken, for them to maintain their position amounts to
   academic/scientific dishonesty.
