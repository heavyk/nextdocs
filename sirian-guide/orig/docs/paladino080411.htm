   Paris, April 11. -- Remarkable reports continue to be published in 
   the French press concerning the eminent Italian medium Eusapia 
   Paladino Scientists, journalists, and other professional 
   investigators of psychic phenomena have all witnessed remarkable 
   demonstrations by her which greatly puzzle them.
  </P>
  <P>
   Anybody who has seen Mme. Paladino would be loath to classify her as 
   a &quot;fake.&quot; She is a woman of more than ordinary 
   intelligence, submits readily to tests and apparently has such 
   genuine confidence in her own powers that it is hard to suspect her 
   of double-dealing. She is a small woman physically, but vigorous and 
   vivacious. Her eyes are dark and lively, her forehead high and 
   strong, her chin shows determination. Her dark hair is turning gray, 
   and over her forehead, like a plume, is a single wisp which is snowy 
   white. She is fifty-three years old.
  </P>
  <P>
   M. Frederic Boutet, a prominent French journalist, tells a graphic 
   story of one of the most recent seances at which Eusapia showed her 
   powers. The seance took place at the house of a friend in a room 
   which had been specially prepared for the demonstration. It was a 
   small, square room, hung with velvet. One of the corners had been cut 
   off by a large black curtain, hung with rings, on an ordinary curtain 
   pole. In this small triangular space, back of the curtain, was a 
   small centre table on which was placed a tambourine. Beside this was 
   a chair on which were a mandolin and an accordeon. In front of the 
   opening, which split the centre of the curtain, was the inevitable 
   table. This was a small kitchen table of ordinary pine. The curtain 
   was in contact with one of its ends.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;Eusapia, with her bent index finger, strikes a few blows on the 
   wood of the table. Like a distant echo comes a knocking in response. 
   The experiment is renewed by several of those who form part of the 
   chain. After that, at the request of the medium, I cut off the 
   electricity. The room is plunged into a reddish twilight favorable to 
   supernatural visitations. The table is again moving. It taps with one 
   of its legs on the floor. One, two, three, four, five. 'That means 
   that there is still too much light, someone explains.' 'No, it is 
   merely to attract attention,' murmurs a lady sitting near me.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;John is coming,&quot; Says another person present.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;John&quot; is the unknown who is Eusapia's familiar spirit.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;We wait. John doesn't come. However, behind the black curtain 
   into the folds of which the groaning medium retreats further and 
   further, we hear the centre table fall over. The tambourine rolls in 
   our direction. The curtain swells out. The mandolin tinkles as though 
   its strings were touched by a swift hand. 'I feel a blow!' Suddenly 
   declares the person seated at Eusapia's left. 'Control,' says she. We 
   are touching her hands and her knees.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;Behind the curtain the centre table, which has been upset, 
   advances and retreats with a shuffling sound. I lean forward to look 
   at it. It stops. The other table is moving.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;'The luminous hand!' Cries a voice. I draw back and gaze with 
   all my eyes. On Eusapia's head, which is almost hidden in the folds 
   of the black cloth, I see a vaguely luminous spot, as though the 
   white wisp of her hair had become phosphorescent. I distinguish the 
   spot, but it in no ways suggests a hand. Moreover, it has already disappeared.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;The curtain waves forward into the room. A young woman sitting 
   near it utters a slight cry. A hand concealed by the cloth has seized 
   her by the arm. The curtain slips along violently on the rings and 
   envelops the medium. The chair behind the curtain is raised by some 
   sort of process, passes through the opening, brushes over Eusapia, 
   and rests on the table. It is almost absolutely dark, and Eusapia, 
   buried in the dark and shadowy folds, is no longer visible.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;Placed around the table were six chairs. In another corner of 
   the room, opposite that cut off by the black curtain, was a lamp 
   behind a red curtain. When the seance began at 9 o'clock, Eusapia 
   took a seat with her back to the black curtain. Behind her was the 
   mysterious triangular space. In front of her was the table between 
   the legs of which she passed her knees. The folds of the curtain fell 
   about her shoulders. Besides Eusapia there were thirteen persons in 
   the room, only three or four of whom were confessed spiritualists.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;Two expert investigators seated themselves on either side of 
   Eusapia. Each of them held one of her hands and she placed her feet 
   on theirs. Five other persons completed the chain. The other members 
   of the party were allowed to remain in the room and look on.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;After an interval of about fifteen minutes Eusapia uttered a 
   slight groan and suddenly requested that a cane chair be given her 
   instead of the upholstered chair upon which she was sitting. Silk is 
   unfavorable to spirits. The cane chair was got from the kitchen and 
   the chain was reformed. The room was still flooded with light, all of 
   the electric lights being turned on. Eusapia requested that half of 
   the lights be turned out. The request was granted.
  </P>
  <P>
   M. Boutet, who was one of the experts holding the hands of the 
   medium, continues his account of what happened as follows:
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;The medium groans again and twists on her chair. Her hair seems 
   to rise on end. The table gives signs of movement. It shivers, 
   creaks, and then rises into the air. &quot;Control,&quot; says 
   Eusapia. 'Nous controlons' we respond together, which signifies that 
   our hands are holding hers and that our knees are touching hers. The 
   table continues to rise. The two legs which are furthest off from 
   Eusapia leave the ground, fall back again, rise another time, and 
   again fall back. At the same time the curtain swells out slightly. 
   The table rises again. This time all four legs quite the ground and 
   fall back to the floor with a noise. Eusapia's hands rest lightly on 
   the table which she seems to draw toward her. Then Eusapia withdraws 
   her hands from the table altogether so that she is no longer touching 
   it except with the folds of her dress, and the table raises itself 
   following the movement indicated by the hands. This experiments 
   suggest the movement of iron following a magnet. This continues 
   during ten seconds.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;'Control,' says the medium. 'Nous controlons,' respond her 
   neighbors with, it seems to me, a little less assurance.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;This is the end of the first part of the seance. The 
   electricity is again turned on. Eusapia groans and covers her eyes. 
   Her hair is in disorder and she seems worn out. She complains of 
   contrary currents which embarrass the experiments. Then, in the 
   fullness of light, the medium, without forming a chain, again holds 
   her hands above the table. The table rises steadily from the floor 
   until it's four legs are in the air. I press upon it, and it requires 
   a considerable effort to bring it to earth again. As soon as I 
   removed my hand it rises again. This time I lie down flat on the 
   floor under it. One of my friends does the same. The table still 
   rises. We seize upon its legs and it suddenly falls back to the 
   floor, one of its feet coming dangerously near the nose of my friend. 
   We both get up confessing, both of us, that it is impossible to see 
   or even to understand the possibility of a trick of any sort.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;At 10:30 the chain is reformed. This time I am seated at 
   Eusapia's left -- the preferred place, as being most exposed to 
   manifestations of the spirit. Eusapia puts her foot on my foot and 
   gives me her hand, but she does not wish me to hold it. She wishes to 
   hold me, and as soon as the light is put out her hand is agitated 
   with continual movement. Her fingers 'play the piano' on my hands. 
   She draws my arm across her knees and does as much for her neighbor's 
   on the right. Table and curtain again begin to give signs of 
   activity. The mandolin rolls behind the curtain, which again envelops Eusapia.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;'Control,' she says. Remembering that the spirit is English, I 
   address him a few words in this language. He rewards me by tugging at 
   the skirts of my coat. Eusapia's hands are placed on her knees one 
   against the other, and in each of her hands are the hands of the 
   controllers whom the spirit now envelops also in the folds of the 
   curtain. Suddenly through the curtain a hand seizes me by the 
   shoulder. I attempt to seize it with my left hand, the right being 
   engaged in the control.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;The hand releases me immediately. For a space nothing happens. 
   Eusapia groans, her hands are unceasingly agitated. The spirit 
   vigorously pulls my hair. 'Look out,' says my self-controller in 
   Latin. And he adds: 'Look out the she doesn't hold both of our hands 
   in one of hers.'
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;The spirit is angry doubtless, for he gives my neighbor a blow 
   in the middle of the back. The table is still moving but the seance 
   is almost over. Eusapia groans. She seems exhausted. The table gives 
   a few more movements. The electric light is again turned on. All is over.&quot;
