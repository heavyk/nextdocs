   <FONT SIZE=4>MEDITATION</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We wish to proceed with instructions for the development 
   of channels for unimpeded energy flow. This will take the place of 
   your present meditation. This is the beginning of a process that will 
   require about three months to complete. It will form a basis to help 
   you to control your own energies upon the physical. Therefore we 
   greatly encourage everyone of you to patiently practice these forms, 
   even if they appear simple or if you have practiced them singularly 
   for other reasons. Each step in this process is a facet of the whole, 
   so give as much attention to that which you do not like as well as 
   the ones you do for surely you wish to be a whole entity.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It will began with a breathing exercise, the explanation 
   thereof following forthwith.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Turn to page 40 and examine the illustration of the 
   seated yogin (illustration not currently available). Give your 
   attention to the IDA which is the clear line, and the PINGALA which 
   is the solid line. Notice that they inscribe each center, each 
   crossing over to the other side as they intersect the SUSHUMNA.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>These intersections become strong blocks for the rising 
   Kundalini and must be cleared before that event. For that purpose, we 
   give this first breathing exercise.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>For the present, see the PINGALA beginning at the right 
   nostril and ending at the left ovary or testicle; the IDA beginning 
   at the left nostril and ending at the right ovary or testicle. Please 
   note the right goes to the left and the left to the right.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>PROCESS</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>1. Close your right nostril with the ring and small 
   finger of your left hand and breathe in silvery CH'I in the left 
   nostril to the count of four. See the energy collect in a spiral 
   around the right ovary/testicle. Breathe out both nostrils to the 
   count of four, seeing the spiral collected around the right ovary 
   shoot up the center of the spine in the color and appearance of 
   lightning. See it go out the top of the head.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Now, reverse the process and breathe through the right 
   nostril seeing its CH'I as a bright red. It spirals around the left 
   ovary/testicle and shoots up the center of the spine in the same 
   color of lightning.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Be sure to force all collected energy around the 
   testicle/ovary out into the base of the spine and out the top of the head.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>WARNING: We are not trying to arouse the Kundalini. We 
   are merely visualizing the energy going up the etheric SUSHAMA not 
   the physical. We must build the structures carefully in mental, 
   astral and etheric matter before bringing it about within the physical.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Do this breathing four times, meaning both sides four 
   times. The exercise can be done up to three times a day. You can also 
   do it before going on to the rest of the meditation.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>2. Go through your polarization building the channel 
   from the CONCRETE MIND to the ABSTRACT MIND, then on to the BUDDHIC.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>At the BUDDHIC, pause, and see a line of energy going 
   from the BUDDHIC, skipping over the MENTAL, going through the ASTRAL 
   and straight into the HEART CENTER from the ASTRAL. The energy begins 
   as yellow and ends in the ASTRAL as bright red and the HEART CENTER 
   is pictured bright red. See this energy forming a permanent link 
   straight from the BUDDHIC. See it nourishing the HEART CENTER 
   over-powering the SOLAR PLEXUS and cutting off its energy from the ASTRAL.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Go back to the ABSTRACT MIND. See a line from it, orange 
   gold, going straight into the ALTA MAJOR CENTER, skipping the ASTRAL. 
   See this energy entering the brain in waves; with it comes long ago 
   memories and super mental faculties and functioning.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>At this point you may descend or assume the polarization 
   to commune with your RAY FORM. After which you would of course descend.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>........Be sure to practice your stretching and 
   movements. If you have a vibrating or massaging machine, use it 
   liberally from your big toes to all over the torso and neck. The head 
   responds better to light sound waves than physical vibrations. But 
   these have to be used with care on the head, lest it activate certain 
   glands that produce substances ranging from sleep inducers to energizers.</FONT>
