   <FONT SIZE=5>INTRODUCTION</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   In 1984, a group of people began meeting to develop Spiritual 
   awareness. They were guided by a group of extra-terrestrials from the 
   Sirian star system. This meeting took place weekly for many years. 
   These are some of the lessons presented by the Sirians.

   <FONT SIZE=5>LESSON ONE</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>POINTS TO BEAR IN MIND</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>1.There is no such thing as inanimate matter.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>2.All things - stuff, entities, Universes, states of 
   consciousness, life - come from the same <B>SOURCE</B>.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>3.You are here to consciously take control of your evolution.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>4.All so-called &quot;truth&quot; becomes relative 
   within and to space/time.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>5.We are going to teach and oversee you in a method that 
   is designed to take you out of the human kingdom into the super-human 
   kingdom. Or stated in a different way - to teach you to be in control 
   of the three planes of human evolution, rather than you being 
   controlled by them.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=3>* * * * *</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We will add to these points as they are needed.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The first part of this course is to introduce you to the 
   structure of the methodology we have decided to use.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>EXPLANATION OF CHOICE</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The Himalayan brotherhood has, within the last one 
   hundred years, given out a structure of the Universe consisting of 
   the septenary plane and subplane system. Within the last fifty to 
   sixty years, they have introduced the septenary ray system. The 
   planes are a matter-spatial qualifying system; the rays are a life 
   and consciousness qualifying system. We will make use of this and 
   other methods given out by Sri Morya.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We deliberately use his methods because he will be the 
   Manu of the coming new age and of the spiritual energy that is to be 
   radiating from the Andes. WE all collaborated before the constructs 
   were given out.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Your physical plane science works from the physical 
   upward; spiritual works are usually attempted from the highest 
   attainable level downwards - we will work on all at once.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As your thinking shifts from the mundane, 
   physically-oriented, and personality-identified self; there will be a 
   great need for <B>BALANCE</B>. You will have to work at balancing the 
   pairs of opposites. You will have to consciously endeavor to balance 
   your spiritual and physical activities. We will instruct you as to 
   how to accomplish this as we go along.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>VERY IMPORTANT FACT</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>You are the thinker. You, the thinker, have projected 
   yourself into three periodic vehicles - mental, emotional or astral 
   and the etheric/physical. The elementals that make up the substance 
   of these vehicles are involutionary and opposed to your evolutionary 
   arc. The conscious state or lack thereof within the aggregate forms 
   you inhabit, OPPOSE every evolutionary step you take. Due to their 
   nature, they can be called the ANTI-SELF.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>EXAMPLES: If you decide to lose weight, you are going to 
   deprive some elementals of their experiences, hence they fight back 
   manipulating the elementals within the desire vehicle to create 
   desire to consume more elementals in the form of food. In some people 
   the substance proves stronger than the will of the projecting entity, 
   so that it carries around with it so many physical elementals that it 
   is detrimental to the incarnating soul. But the elementals haven't 
   acquired a consciousness that can relate cause and effect yet, so 
   they act for the moment. And since you, the incarnating agent, have 
   not yet been taught what you are; taught not to IDENTIFY yourself 
   with the periodic vehicles; the elementals can convince you that 
   their desires and needs are your own.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This becomes even more apparent when you began the 
   cleansing, or reprogramming, of the astral and mental vehicles. You 
   can be seized with illogical fears, doubts, insecurities, and so on. 
   It is important not to identify yourself with these emotions for they 
   are the sum total of the aggregate elementals that make up those 
   vehicles. The reason they fight so is they are losing their structure 
   of service and they learn by doing or serving only. When you evolve, 
   you are replacing all lower vibratory substance with higher 
   vibrations. They are losing their world and not having the faculty to 
   reason, it doesn't occur to them that they can in turn, go to another 
   vehicle to learn. They simply fight you.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The information presented above explains why so many 
   people have such a hard time when they first begin the Path. The 
   elementals are at that time stronger than the people who have begun 
   the Path; therefore they can do more damage....</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Also due to this fact, we will spend the first part of 
   this course getting you to IDENTIFY YOURSELF.</FONT>
  </P>
