   <B><FONT COLOR=#00007F>[EDITOR'S NOTE: THE FOLLOWING IS A VERY 
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL CONTACT EXPERIENCE THAT 
   TOOK PLACE IN 1956-57. THIS IS A TRUE STORY AND VERY DETAILED. IF 
   DETAILS BOTHER YOU, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU AT LEAST READ SECTION

  </P>
  <P>
   I have been asked to write up information about experiences with 
   extra-terrestrials that I began to remember in 1989. The knowledge 
   that it occurred was conscious. Hypnosis was used to retrieve the 
   memories from childhood.
  </P>
  <P>
   The events themselves are probably not important. I feel that it has 
   happened to thousands of people and that is why I am writing what I 
   have remembered. I hope that it helps others to remember. I know that 
   this information, a very real and physical part of my life was 
   extraordinarily blocked for 37 years. For whatever reason, in 1989, 
   it was time to remember.
  </P>
  <P>
   The first recall starts in early 1955, late February or early March. 
   It is still cold in the Connecticut town where I was approaching my 
   third birthday.
  </P>
  <P>
   I am sitting on the edge of the bed. There was a pulsating green glow 
   coming in through the window of my bedroom. Everything was silent. I 
   mean completely silent.
  </P>
  <P>
   I hear footsteps up the back steps and the back door open. I wasn't 
   frightened. In fact, I was very calm, almost detached.
  </P>
  <P>
   The footsteps approach my room and the door opens. Enter a blond 
   haired man and woman. They are wearing a one piece suit that reminds 
   me of my pajamas with the feet built into them. The color is a dull 
   silver. To my child mind, I think they are pajamas. They look about 
   the size of my parents. The woman is somewhat smaller than the man.
  </P>
  <P>
   They are standing there looking at me and I am sitting on the bed 
   looking at them. They approached no closer than 3 feet. When they 
   first come in they said, &quot;Hello,&quot; and they knew my name. 
   They were talking like the New England people with the accent. That 
   is what I was use to hearing.
  </P>
  <P>
   I don't know these people but they seem to know me. I asked them, 
   &quot;Who are you?&quot; And the man says, &quot;We are your 
   friends.&quot; I tell them I don't know them. And the woman says, 
   &quot;You don't remember us, but one day you will.&quot; It seems 
   that the woman did most of the speaking.
  </P>
  <P>
   The following is quoted from the hypnosis session transcript:
  </P>
  <P>
   The woman says that they have come to visit and they will visit from 
   time to time to help me learn big things. It seems that they are 
   talking in words that are understandable to my three year old 
   consciousness. So they are being fairly basic. They say that they are 
   here now because I have reached the triad age, that the age of three 
   is significant for our type and that multiples of three have 
   significant meaning. They're not saying significant, they are saying, 
   holding up three fingers and saying that, &quot;This many is 
   important.&quot; That it's an important number to remember.
  </P>
  <P>
   I asked, &quot;Why?&quot; They say they can't tell me yet but that 
   they are my friends and that we have been friends for a long time. 
   They say that it is time for them to leave, that they wanted to visit 
   and say, &quot;Hello,&quot; and it is time for me to go back to 
   sleep. They tell me not to look at the light outside.
  </P>
  <P>
   So I lay back down and cover up. And, the man leading the way, they 
   turn around and open the door and walk out closing the door behind 
   them. I hear them walk out the back door.
  </P>
  <P>
   I don't go to sleep immediately. I hear kind of a hum and a bright 
   green light momentarily shines through the window. Then it stops and 
   it is dark again except for a dim streetlight. I got sleepy and went 
   to sleep.
  </P>
  <P>
   It seems that these extra-terrestrial visitors had the ability to 
   influence people's decisions and that at the time of that visit, they 
   knew that the family was going to move. Ironically, that move was to 
   be to the Pensacola-Gulf Breeze area. The first place we lived was in 
   Gulf Breeze and that is where I saw the extra-terrestrials next in 
   late 1955 or early 1956.
  </P>
  <P>
   I don't recall too much of the next visit with the 
   extra-terrestrials. I do know that it took place in Gulf Breeze, 
   Florida in late 1955 or early 1956. What is most memorable about this 
   visit is that I could see the ship approaching through the window.
  </P>
  <P>
   Gulf Breeze in 1955/56 was a tiny place and Pensacola Beach had 
   little development. There were some cottages just beyond the turnoff 
   to the Pensacola Beach bridge that my family rented while they 
   searched for a more permanent residence.
  </P>
  <P>
   The cottage we had was in the back with the rear facing the sound. 
   There was a window that I could see Santa Rosa Island and to the 
   right, the drawbridge that connected Gulf Breeze to the island. I 
   really liked this window because I use to watch a tugboat push a 
   barge through the drawbridge every morning and bring it back every 
   afternoon. It was also through this window that I recalled seeing the 
   extra-terrestrial space craft coming in over the Gulf of Mexico 
   beyond Santa Rosa island.
  </P>
  <P>
   What sticks with me about this experience is that the craft, a 
   classic flying saucer, had a shimmering orange glow over its surface 
   as it flew through the air.
  </P>
  <P>
   Between the cottage and the sound, there was a stretch of land that 
   sloped slightly and ultimately went to a small beach with a short 
   pier. It was on the land between the cottage and the small beach that 
   the flying saucer landed. I don't recall the actual landing because 
   as the craft got closer, I stopped watching it. It seems that I had 
   been trained not to look at the power source which could burn the 
   eyes like arc welding.
  </P>
  <P>
   I do know from later experiences that once the craft was on the 
   ground, the shimmering orange faded and the actual metal of the craft 
   was a dull silver color.
  </P>
  <P>
   This was my first encounter with the extra-terrestrials in Florida. I 
   find it ironic that their first appearance was in Gulf Breeze with 
   all the publicity of the Ed Walters' sightings beginning in 1987. 
   However, the Pensacola-Gulf Breeze area has had a continuous stream 
   of extra-terrestrial visitations that extend back to the 1940s. I was 
   told by the extra-terrestrials when I was a child that they had 
   chosen the Pensacola area to concentrate &quot;their people&quot; for 
   ease of visitation. And it is interesting to note the people that 
   have been pulled to this area from all over the world.
  </P>
  <P>
   Anyway, the Gulf Breeze encounter was one of many that have extended 
   over a period of 43 years. Although there were many encounters in 
   between, the next one I shall detail involves a flying saucer trip in 
   late 1956 or early 1957 that picked up several passengers and took 
   them to an extra-terrestrial base in New England.
