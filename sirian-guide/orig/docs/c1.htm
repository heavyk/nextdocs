   I got into channeling 22 years ago before it became a buzzword. I 
   didn't start out to be a channeler, it sort of happened over a period 
   of years. I'm not exclusive or rare as others have the talent as 
   well. However, not everyone that claims to be a channeler really can 
   do it. I don't claim to be anything. I want to tell you how it 
   developed and you can draw your own conclusions.
  </P>
  <P>
   I became interested in psychic phenomena when I was 20 years old. It 
   was summer and I had a student job provided by the state. It was a 
   make work program that paid minimum wage. Since it was made up as a 
   help to struggling students, there was much free time. I decided to 
   spend my time reading after I had completed my assignments for the 
   day. My theme was psychic phenomena.
  </P>
  <P>
   The book that most fascinated me was THE SETH MATERIAL by Jane 
   Roberts. Even though I feel that Ms. Roberts got off the path towards 
   the end of her life, I was always impressed with the early works. I 
   read that book and other related psychic phenomena books from the 
   public library that summer.
  </P>
  <P>
   In July of that year, my father had the first of a series of heart 
   attacks. While I was visiting him in the hospital, I mentioned the 
   topic of psychic phenomena that I had been reading as a point of 
   discussion and he told me about his grandmother, my great 
   grandmother, a topic that had never been discussed with me.
  </P>
  <P>
   It appears that his grandmother, a person who had died years before I 
   was born, was a <B>physical medium</B>. She could make objects move 
   and strange things always went on at her house. For example, rocks 
   would fly up out of the yard and hit the house and all the locks 
   would become unlocked routinely by themselves.
  </P>
  <P>
   When he was 10, my father got the only personal performance from his 
   grandmother that he ever saw. He had heard all the talk in the family 
   about her &quot;strangeness&quot; and he wanted to see it. He 
   pestered her for a long time and she finally agreed to show him if he 
   would never mention it again. He and several of his playmates were 
   present. There was a solid oak table in the dining room that weighed 
   about 300 pounds. She had them stand by the table and they all held 
   hands with her. As she raised her hands up, the table rose off the 
   floor. She told them it would bounce once for yes and twice for no 
   and they could ask the spirits questions. Of course, a child can't 
   think of much to ask and my father regretted that he had not asked 
   anything significant. The table did bob up and down in answer to the 
   few questions that he asked. The other children were too frightened 
   to speak. Then his grandmother said she was finished, lowered her 
   hands and the table resumed its place on the floor. My father said 
   that her complexion had turned pale as if she had exerted a great 
   deal of effort.
  </P>
  <P>
   Such a wild experience and I was hearing about it for the first time 
   at the age of 20. My grandfather, it was his mother, NEVER mentioned 
   anything about her. I surmised that the only reason I heard about it 
   was that my father was ill and I was reading about the topic.
  </P>
  <P>
   My father did have a more serious heart attack a few days later but 
   managed to partially recover after weeks in intensive care. It was 
   that summer that I learned an unusual thing about myself, I 
   discovered I could tell when someone was going to die!
