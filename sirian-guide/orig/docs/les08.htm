   <FONT SIZE=4>THE SECOND RAY TRIAD</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As was mentioned last week, the FIRST RAY TRIAD of the 
   Atlantean pantheon did not manifest among the people after 75,000 
   B.C. Their energies could no longer be tolerated and humanity was too 
   terrified by their appearance. It befell the SECOND, THIRD, and 
   SEVENTH RAY TRIADS to teach and promulgate their mission.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We will describe the SECOND RAY TRIAD next, but before 
   that let us review the SECOND COSMIC RAY.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The SECOND COSMIC RAY is the quality of love and wisdom. 
   You will notice that these two concepts are indeed difficult to 
   concisely and accurately define. There is no one word or succinct 
   phrase to readily convey to anyone else what one thinks love or 
   wisdom means. That is because Love and Wisdom are qualities of 
   Consciousness and therefore, their meaning will vary according to the 
   state of conscious evolution.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Because of this, the THIRD RAY, or mentation, is 
   developed within substance and evolving life waves first. This is so 
   that the consciousness will have a mind to use in developing love. 
   The correct blending of manas and love results in wisdom. Both of 
   these are required before there can safely be a FIRST RAY life wave. 
   Power cannot be safely given to corruptible entities.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Some names of the SECOND RAY are:</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The Motivator</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The Preserver</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The Gluon</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The Christ</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The SECOND RAY TRIAD is made up of Isis, a SECOND RAY 
   female; Ra, a THIRD RAY male; and Osiris, a SIXTH RAY male.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Even though these males are not themselves SECOND RAY, 
   they have been attributed SECOND RAY characteristics because they 
   work with and distribute SECOND RAY energy.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Isis came to this system in a humanoid vehicle that had 
   evolved from a source of which there is no analogy on this planet. 
   She has a body covered with green, gold and blue striped fuzz and two 
   antennae on her head. She is responsible for the &quot;great loving 
   mother and husband myths.&quot; She actively taught and healed humans 
   until her withdrawal at about 20,000 B.C. She is a great peace maker. 
   She exemplifies the giving of oneself so that life can grow and expand.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Ra, being the THIRD RAY of this triad was also the 
   oldest, hence his credit of having fathered the other two. He also 
   kept order within the SECOND RAY organization which amounted to what 
   became known as religion. Ra arrived here in a vehicle that was 
   fairly human looking except that it was transparent. He has a silicon 
   based body which accounts for his glowing like a crystal. He 
   exemplifies the use of mind in organizing the goal of munkind.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Osiris is a SIXTH RAY who, true to his ray type, set 
   about the task with idealistic intensity. He is the great example and 
   motivator in action of the people. His vehicle had evolved from a 
   canine like race. His color is red and white and he exemplifies use 
   of ardent striving or aspiration toward the goal of munkind.</FONT>
