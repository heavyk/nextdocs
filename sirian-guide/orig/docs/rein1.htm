   Robert M. Stone, M.S.

  <P>
   Reincarnation is an ancient philosophy that states the soul is not
   perfect, physical life is the classroom and the soul must return, be
   reincarnated, time and time again until it learns the lessons of life
   and breaks free of the cycle.
  </P>
  <P>
   The concept of Reincarnation has existed for thousands of years. Most
   ancient religions included this philosophy. Even the Christian
   religion included Reincarnation until a policy change in Rome decided
   to delete it in the 13th century. Arthur Guirdham's, <B>We Are One Another</B>
   talks about the last major group of Catholics who supported the
   concept of reincarnation that were eliminated in the mid 1200s.
  </P>
  <P>
   However, Western religious dictates aside, the concept of
   Reincarnation spans the globe and is found in many diverse cultures
   that have no contact with each other.
  </P>
  <P>
   I did not learn about the philosophy of Reincarnation until I was
   twenty years old. Yet, my spontaneous recalls of previous lifetimes
   started when I was a child. I don't remember all the recall incidents
   after all these years but there are several that are still vivid for
   me that I will relate to you.
  </P>
  <P>
   When I was seven years of age, I developed pneumonia. By the time I
   was taken to the doctor, it was serious enough where I was
   hospitalized. I was in the hospital, an old structure built in Gothic
   style around 1919, for close to a week. The first three or four days,
   I didn't even notice the painful IM penicillin shots going into my
   rear. When I finally started to get better, I began to notice and
   soon protested. I got out of the hospital shortly after that, thank
   goodness, but I had a weakness in my lungs that persisted for years;
   it manifested itself as a difficulty in getting a deep breath.
  </P>
  <P>
   Apparently this experience with being very sick and taken to a very
   old hospital triggered my first past life memory although it was just
   a fragment. As a child, I would say the Lord's prayer before going to
   bed. After my illness, when I got to the, &quot;If I should die
   before I wake..&quot; part, a vivid scene would always come clearly
   into mind. I didn't understand what it was but it happened every time
   for as long as I said the Lord's prayer before bed.
  </P>
  <P>
   When I got to that passage of the prayer, a hospital room would flash
   to mind. It was an old room with furnishings like the old hospital I
   had been to with my pneumonia. The scene was the end of a bed with
   adult feet observable under the sheet. The occupant of the bed was
   obscured by a screen which was a pleated white fabric attached to a
   metal frame so that is could be moved. I was facing the bed and could
   only see the screen and the feet under the sheet as well as a chrome
   or shiny metal light in the corner.
  </P>
  <P>
   As a child, I wondered what this was but also, WHY? Since it happened
   every time I said the prayer before bed, I had plenty of experiences
   to analyze. First, it couldn't have been me in the bed because at
   seven, I was not that tall. It obviously was an adult. Second, I had
   been to a hospital before to see my great grandfather but it was a
   more modern building, not this old style as in this memory scene. I
   quickly learned that, &quot;If I should die before I wake...&quot;
   triggered the scene. I could mentally repeat it out of context and it
   would bring the scene to mind. So I knew what triggered it but had no
   conceptual framework for reincarnation and did not find out what the
   scene was until I was 23.
  </P>
  <P>
   After this started, I had at least two memorable dreams that were
   obvious past life memories although I did not realize them as such.
  </P>
  <P>
   Once, when I was 8 or 9, I was having a very vivid dream. There were
   three men being attacked by a group of four Indians. The Indians were
   in buckskins and war paint. The men were in buckskins also. One of
   the men, a tall fellow with a brown beard riveted my attention. He
   had brown hair and blue eyes. This scene was sometime in the 1700s.
   The men were using single shot muskets. I noticed in the dream that I
   was watching the scene but also seeing the scene from the tall man
   with the beard. At this time in my young life, my hair was very light
   brown; actually blond. Anyway, as I begin to see through this man's
   eyes, the seriousness of the situation began to impact me. Everyone
   of the men had fired their single shot muskets and there were still
   four screaming Indians rushing towards them with tomahawks and
   knives. One of the men was frantically reloading, another had pulled
   his hunting knife and the tall man, obviously me, was reaching for a
   flintlock pistol in his belt.
  </P>
  <P>
   When his left hand went to close around the pistol, my left hand
   closed also but when I fingers hit my palm with NO pistol, I woke up
   like turning on a switch. It was as if I were in shock to NOT find
   that pistol which was obviously needed in the situation.
  </P>
  <P>
   I KNEW as a child that this tall man with the dark brown hair and
   beard was me. He was obviously left-handed. Although I started out
   trying to be left-handed, it was socially unacceptable in the 1950s
   and my mother discouraged it. How did I know it was me? Well, I could
   feel it and see the situation through his eyes. What triggered such a
   scene? Well, I was probably prone to it after the pneumonia and my
   favorite shows were Davy Crocket, Daniel Boone and Francis Marion,
   the Swamp Fox. All from that era. Even though the shows triggered the
   recall, the person I dreamed about was not an 8 or 9 year old kid,
   but a full grown adult with a beard. Again, I had no conceptual
   framework for the situation.
  </P>
  <P>
   The last spontaneous recall I will relate happened when I was 16 and
   in the 10th grade. When I entered high school, it was necessary to
   take a language. The only one that appealed to me was German and I
   was very good at it. This was my first year of the language and of
   course, I did not have a vocabulary to speak of but nonetheless, I
   had the following dream one night.
  </P>
  <P>
   The scene was a train station right out of the 1920s. Again, the
   dream started with me watching as an observer. There was a young man
   there, probably in his early 20s, of average height. There was an
   obese woman with two young boys, one on either side, sitting on the
   bench waiting on the train. The young man apparently knew this woman
   because he was asking to borrow enough money for a train ticket back
   to the city where they both lived. The woman was chiding the young
   man for spending all his money at the Oktoberfest and being
   irresponsible. The young man was diplomatically sidestepping the
   chiding and working on borrowing the train fair.
  </P>
  <P>
   As the conversation progressed, I merged more with the young man. The
   conversation was taking place in GERMAN. As I was looking on, I was
   aware of what was being said but as I began to merge with the young
   man, my current self tripped me up. I didn't have this extensive a
   German vocabulary. I didn't know what I was saying; was it right?
   These thoughts quickly ended the dream and woke me up.
  </P>
  <P>
   Again, no conceptual framework for the experience. I was not looking
   for Reincarnation experiences because I didn't know they existed.
   However, they found me. When I STARTED looking for them, I found all
   sorts of interesting things from the distant past.
  </P>
  <P>
   Critics of Reincarnation have many silly rationalizations to explain
   away people's past life memories. In a future article I will address
   them. Basically though, the system of Reincarnation exists. A person
   ignoring it is simply not taking control of their destiny and
   benefiting from experiences in the distant past.
