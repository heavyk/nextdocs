  <TITLE>UFOs in the Gulf Breeze-Pensacola Area: Contact Since1955.Pt7</TITLE>
  <META NAME="description" CONTENT="UFOs have been the the Gulf Breeze-Pensacola area long before Ed Walters took his photographs in 1987. Here, a local resident presents an unusual extra-terrestrial contact experience involving several other people, both local and non-local, that resulted in a trip to an extra-terrestrial base on Earth inside a mountain.">

   As I approach the last section of this series, I would like to say 
   that the information you have been reading was derived from a series 
   of hypnosis sessions between June of 1989 to October of 1990. There 
   were many details and experiences covered in the sessions that were 
   omitted from this presentation for brevity. The information remained 
   consistent from session to session for over a year.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   In presenting what was discussed at this meeting with 
   extra-terrestrials in late 1956 or early 1957, I am going to report 
   an abbreviation of the conversation threads as they developed in the 
   last hypnosis session of the series in October of 1990. At that time 
   I did not know what this information meant because it's meaning was 
   being blocked from my consciousness. It wasn't until several years 
   later that I discovered the details. The content of these last few 
   paragraphs are complete stories by themselves and will ultimately be 
   presented in the detail they require and merit.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   This information can be considered controversial but it is what 
   happened. There is a big debate about the various extra-terrestrial 
   civilizations and there are always supporters for every one of them. 
   So this last section that characterizes a particular extra-terrestrial
    civilization in a particular way is not intended for debate. It is 
   informational only. Everyone is entitled to their opinion.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Continuing the conversation flow: After the topic of the next 
   generation of us, whatever we are and whatever that is, the extra-terrestrials
    began talking about their concern about the genetic breakthrough 
   that the gray aliens had made in Nazi Germany. They said the gray 
   extra-terrestrials had succeeded in contriving a way to make their 
   alien gametes work with human gametes. The goal was a half human-half 
   gray alien with the superiority of the extra-terrestrial portion.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   It was obvious that the gray extra-terrestrials did not have the best 
   interest of humans in mind.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Additional information was discussed, which may be presented later in 
   it's appropriate context, about this topic and then logistic 
   solutions about the situation were discussed but that was blocked 
   from my recall at that time.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   When the meeting ended, we went back to the matter transformation 
   tubes and were returned to our &quot;normal&quot; selves.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The after effects of the process can only be described as feeling 
   like....., the closest analogy, and it is not the best, is like a 
   hangover without the headache.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   We went back to the shuttle which took us back to the flying saucer. 
   The saucer exited the mountain and we were dropped off in reverse 
   order of pickup which is only logical.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   That was the experience one night in late 1956 or early 1957. I hope 
   that you found it interesting and possibly informative.
