   <FONT SIZE=4>A BRIEF HISTORY OF ALIEN CULTURES</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   The planetary system around Sol, as well as its Galaxy in general, is 
   vastly different from other parts of the Universe in that the 
   consciousnesses inhabit bodies of flesh. The extra-terrestrial 
   inhabitants of this Galaxy developed their civilizations to a high 
   degree over millions of earth years.
  </P>
  <P>
   The civilizations had branched off into two types. One type of 
   civilization was highly Spiritually advanced as well as 
   technologically advanced. The other civilization was highly 
   technologically advanced but more materially oriented. Both types of 
   civilizations had billions of inhabitants and a technology the power 
   of which is difficult for an Earth person to comprehend.
  </P>
  <P>
   The Spiritually/Technologically advanced civilizations were by far 
   the most powerful. The high development of Spirituality allowed them 
   to create great powers because they had the Wisdom necessary to 
   justly use such powers. These entities in their Spirituality were 
   united as one.
  </P>
  <P>
   The Technologically advanced civilizations were not as powerful as 
   the Spiritually advanced ones because they did not have the Wisdom to 
   handle such power, but they were vastly powerful compared to Earth 
   standards. They had developed inter-Solar System space travel; they 
   traded amongst themselves in the various Solar Systems. However, due 
   to their line of development, they did not interact with the 
   Spiritually advanced civilizations; they could not handle the 
   magnitude of the energy that those beings radiated. It was too much 
   for their level of development.
  </P>
  <P>
   The Technologically advanced civilizations operated mainly on form 
   and tradition. And the tradition extended back for millennia. In the 
   beginning, they were not war-like because they knew of the 
   destructive results of war. Their greatest pride was their material 
   creations and they had a unilateral agreement amongst themselves that 
   they would not destroy each others creations.
  </P>
  <P>
   Initially there were no positions of power in these civilizations. As 
   in other parts of the Universe, they coordinated themselves with a 
   council system and everyone was equal. With billions of inhabitants, 
   the council served as the representative group. These councils were 
   composed of the wisest of the wise. And in many instances the 
   children of council members, after much training, assumed their 
   parents position. Please note that the councils were made up of both 
   male and female members because there was no such thing as sexual 
   discrimination and there was no such thing as racial discrimination.
  </P>
  <P>
   Yes, among these Technologically advanced civilizations, there were 
   different body types and characteristics depending on the conditions 
   of the Solar Systems in which the civilizations existed. There was a 
   variance from Solar System to Solar System, and in many instances 
   from inhabited planet to inhabited planet within a given Solar 
   System. However, each planet's species was homogeneous.
  </P>
  <P>
   These societies were ordered on material creations or possessions. 
   The inhabitants were considered equal but the material creations were 
   more important. It was the material orientations that opened the door 
   to problems. It started when tradition began to be altered a little 
   at a time over long spans of time.
  </P>
  <P>
   The first error was the creation of weapons of destruction. Prior to 
   this time such was unnecessary because all the civilizations of the 
   Technological group had long agreed that they did not want to destroy 
   each others' creations. They realized that in each of the Solar 
   Systems resources existed that needed to be shared amongst them all 
   and to effectively distribute the resources required the combined 
   efforts of all the Technological civilizations.
  </P>
  <P>
   After the creation of weapons of destruction, a new element was 
   interjected into all the civilizations and it had various impacts at 
   various times; Planetary Nationalism was the rationalization that was 
   used. Weapons for defense; what if another planet or another Solar 
   System decided to steal the resources rather than trading for them? 
   It had never happened before but everyone had weapons which created 
   doubt and distrust. This began to grow on many different planets and 
   in many different Solar Systems.
  </P>
  <P>
   And so the councils of the Technologically advanced civilizations 
   believed it was logical to be cautious; to have weapons for defense. 
   It was authorized that such weapons were to be created and these 
   weapons were indeed powerful. You could look at them in terms of 
   &quot;DOOMSDAY&quot; weapons because they could annihilate entire 
   civilizations and destroy entire planets. Such was the power that 
   these Technologically advanced entities had tapped. But compared to 
   the destruction of planets, the Spiritually / Technologically 
   advanced civilizations had tapped a power that, if misused, could 
   destroy the entire Galaxy. So from an Earth perspective, the 
   Technologically advanced civilizations were potent, but compared to 
   the Spiritually advanced civilizations, they were still a drop in the bucket.
  </P>
  <P>
   Within two generations the order and form of the materialistic 
   civilizations had turned against them. What you would call a 
   military-industrial complex had been created. The people, with their 
   rigidity of form and lack of Spiritual thought, were pushed into a 
   non-thinking role; taught to obey orders without question. The people 
   became less important than material <I>things</I>. With people less 
   important than materials and lacking spirituality, it was just a 
   matter of time before the aggression started.
  </P>
  <P>
   There were many excuses; many rationalizations for what triggered the 
   results. If you study recent Earth history, you will find that Adolf 
   Hitler had many of the same reasons for what he did. And so the wars 
   began. Interplanetary and inter-Solar System wars. In some Solar 
   Systems the planets fought amongst themselves. In other Solar 
   Systems, the planets joined together to attack other Solar Systems. 
   Billions of people were destroyed; numerous planets ceased to exist; 
   entire Solar Systems were destroyed. This went on until there were 
   only two major civilizations left; each on opposite sides of the 
   Galaxy. The shear distance and the need to recover their losses 
   initiated the peace that then existed.
  </P>
  <P>
   After a recovery period of millions of Earth years, the technological 
   civilizations began to consider attacking the 
   Spiritually/Technologically advanced civilizations.
  </P>
  <P>
   It was impossible for the Techs to approach the star systems of the 
   Spiritually/Technologically advanced civilizations but they saw the 
   opportunity to attack in star systems that were remote. One such 
   system contains the Earth.
  </P>
  <P>
   The Spiritually/Technologically advanced civilizations were observing 
   and in some instances aiding the development of humanity. The Techs 
   saw this as the perfect opportunity to test their strength against 
   the S/Ts.
  </P>
  <P>
   This situation started about 15,000 earth years ago. The 
   non-aggressive S/Ts did not bother the Techs when their ships began 
   to approach earth.
  </P>
  <P>
   To be continued..... There use to be a planet between Mars and Jupiter
