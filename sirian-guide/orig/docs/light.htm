  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   If you ever encounter an extra-terrestrial and they point a hand held 
   tube device at you, I would suggest that you immediately take evasive 
   action. You see, it is a sophisticated, powerful multifunction device 
   that, since it can kill, could be considered a weapon although it is 
   rarely used for such purposes.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The device itself is about six inches long, cylindrical with a 
   diameter of approximately 1 &#190; inches in diameter and a black 
   color. Actually, it looks a great deal like a short Mag Light, D-cell 
   flashlight without the head.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The back end is closed and recessed in the front, about &#189; inch 
   is a multifaceted crystal. The crystal is clear with a flat face and 
   eight sides. There is no mechanical activation of the device as it 
   appears to be thought controlled.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The device is capable of many things but I will discuss two modes of 
   which it is capable. One mode projects a dull yellow beam. This beam 
   is a neural disruptor that causes disruption of the exterior skeletal 
   muscles of humans, e.g. the arms and legs. Obviously, this renders 
   the human motionless, yet does not interfere with life functions such 
   as breathing.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Another mode projects a medium, electric blue beam. This beam has 
   physical impact; by impact I mean that it has the same effect as 
   hitting someone with a solid object. The greater the intensity, the 
   greater the impact. Although not used for this purpose, excess 
   intensity can cause mortal damage to a human like any hard, striking object.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Extra-terrestrials use colored light in many different capacities and 
   scales; hand held portable devices and much larger craft mounted 
   devices. For example, the blue beam is used on a larger scale 
   projected from a saucer mounted device. Wide spread dispersion of the 
   blue beam can be used in a tractor capacity. This is accomplished by 
   engulfing the human at a low intensity, increasing the intensity 
   which clamps around the individual and retracting the beam drawing 
   the person in with the beam literally gripping them like a solid object.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Extra-terrestrials are very aware of the effects of different colored 
   light and use them accordingly. As more information becomes available 
   on this topic, I will post it.
