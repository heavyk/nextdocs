   <FONT SIZE=3>It is I Kathumi. I have come this evening to continue 
   our presentation on life after death, with a more detailed discussion 
   of the Astral realm. As you recall from the last time, I mentioned 
   that people of a certain evolutionary character upon immediately 
   passing through the death transition resided in the middle level of 
   the Astral plane, that they created thought forms of cities and 
   carried on a life if you will emulating the one that they left. I 
   also intimated that the key to resolving a fixation on the Astral 
   plane was a resolution of relationships.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>On the physical plane relationships involve two basic 
   factors. The emotional element and the mental element depending on 
   the nature of the emotions and the nature of the beliefs determines 
   to outcome of the relationship.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The emotional element can be characterized as a need to 
   possess, jealousy, exclusiveness, a total preoccupation with the 
   object of the relationship. For you see when the emotions are allowed 
   to function in this manner the entity ceases to be an entity and is 
   indeed nothing more than an object, a piece of property, a 
   possession. Unfortunately in most societies in the world this view is 
   openly fostered. The relationship can be a male-female one, a 
   parent-child, those are the main emotionally ridden ones.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>So what effect does this produce? In Christian culture 
   the discussion has been raised many times, in the Protestant realms, 
   as to what an individual does when he is widowed and remarries? What 
   happens when the three of them meet in heaven? This is of great 
   concern to the consciousness of people who think in terms of 
   possession, in terms of exclusivity. At the middle level that we 
   referred to, it results in emotional turmoil if the non-physicals, 
   the disincarnates happen to join the same thought form say. In most 
   instances this is prevented from occurring by the guides and the 
   teachers who travel the middle realm. But occasionally it does occur 
   and it does result in conflict and turmoil. For the entities on the 
   middle level are indeed emulating their physical lives.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The key to progressing to the upper level of the Astral 
   is to cultivate in a genuine sense &quot;unconditional love&quot;, 
   &quot;unconditional acceptance&quot;. This is a monumental task on 
   the physical plane where expectations and payoffs are the order and 
   the socially accepted norm. And yet if a person begins to overcome 
   the petty emotions of jealousy, competition, ownership and through 
   evolution perceives the person as a person and not as a stereotype or 
   role-model they can progress to the upper level of the Astral plane.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Emotions are still an issue here but at this level more 
   refined ways of dealing with the emotions are studied. Alternative 
   ways of conducting relationships are explored. One can never invest 
   their lives into another's, it does not benefit the investor or the 
   investee. This is a difficult lesson for many entities to learn. 
   Emotions weave the heaviest chains of Karma, excessive hatred, anger, 
   resentment as well as conditional love. Ownership, possession weigh 
   the entity down and retards growth. When an entity passes over with 
   these emotions operating full force they spend for a time a sojourn 
   in the dregs of the Astral, tormented by their own emotional 
   imbalance. The teachers and guides work to rescue these unfortunate 
   ones but many of them can only be reached from the earth plane for 
   the material nature of their fixation orients them more towards that 
   sphere. This fixation works from both directions. As has been 
   mentioned in the past those that excessively mourn the passing of a 
   loved one when it is carried to extremes are really expressing 
   selfishness not love and caring, for the emotion that they express 
   holds the loved one down preventing them from seeking the level that 
   they have achieved.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>At this point it would be appropriate to discuss the 
   concept of suicide as a means of departing the physical. Suicide of 
   necessity involves emotion in some form or other. In many instances 
   it involves frustration and anger, hostility turned against the self 
   which is called depression. The person allows the elementals of their 
   emotions to torment them while on the physical sphere and they 
   unaware consciously of the laws seek relief by killing the body, when 
   the problem actually resides with the spirit itself or the psyche, 
   which is immortal. That unfortunate entity kills himself and 
   discovers rapidly that all the pain, all the turmoil is still there. 
   The difference is that they no longer have a physical body. These 
   individuals in many instances find themselves on the lower level, the 
   lowest level of the Astral again a victim of excessive emotionalism, 
   a victim of ignorance. For you see the emotions are under control of 
   the psyche. The emotions are energy and the energy can be refined, it 
   can manifest itself in a purer form and that is the obligation and 
   the responsibility of the entity while on the physical. It is the 
   only place where the emotions and the beliefs can be resolved. It can 
   not be done at the higher levels, for it originates at the bottom and 
   the path back to the source begins at the bottom.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>One can look upon it as climbing up the rope of the 
   sutrama. If you have ever climbed a rope you see how difficult it is 
   to do so. Climbing the sutrama is in a like sense as difficult. One 
   must start at the bottom and with great difficulty progress.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>One other aspect of the emotions, one that is not as 
   common but a factor non the less, involves emotions directed towards 
   material things as opposed to people. Some individuals have a 
   fixation towards possessions whether it be what you refer to as money 
   or gold or the need to rule over people which is impersonal in a way. 
   It involves power or what they perceive as power or emotions directed 
   towards a particular occupation or physical endeavor resulting in 
   physical outcomes. These individuals have a tendency to fixate 
   themselves even lower than the nightmarish threshold between the 
   physical and the middle and upper Astral. These are the unfortunates 
   whom are referred to as &quot;ghosts&quot; or &quot;haunts&quot;. 
   They are actually on the etheric level just below the nightmarish 
   band between the physical and the middle and upper Astral. These 
   entities can only be reached by those still living where they are so 
   closely aligned with the physical plane. As I said it is indeed 
   fortunate that most people do not orient themselves towards material 
   things. It's unfortunate that in the religion of Christianity the 
   greatest warning was directed towards material things or the level of 
   material things, because the danger of possession of another was not 
   only overlooked but encouraged and the nature of slavery and 
   subjugation of races and certain sexes. This was due to ignorance of 
   the inhabitants at the time when people were viewed as property not 
   as people; when life was inconsequential and the taking of life was 
   common place and almost at a whim. It's unfortunate that thinking 
   people today adopt the creed that has its roots in barbarism and 
   meaninglessness of the individual. That is one of the things we hope 
   to enlighten man to. We feel that that is sufficient information this 
   evening for the Astral.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>There is much that can be said and perhaps we will touch 
   up on several points in the future. It is possible that we shall 
   proceed with the mental level and define it in the near future....</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>...Our blessings upon each of you. And we hope that each 
   of your consciousness will one day accept who you are and enjoy that 
   revelation and know that we are one in our endeavor to bring light to humanity.</FONT>
