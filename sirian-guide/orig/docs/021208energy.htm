<FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>Every time the so called skeptics of 
   extra-terrestrial visitation to this planet bring out their tired 
   refrain that there are no extra-terrestrials because there is no 
   physical evidence, I have to laugh.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>There have been hundreds of 
   thousands of witnesses to airborne alien craft and thousands with up 
   close encounters of extra-terrestrials. Yet authority figures the 
   world over deny that extra-terrestrials exist. Some outright, others 
   with weasel words about how UFOs pose no threat to national security.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>Witnesses are harassed into silence, 
   physical evidence confiscated and witnesses who won't be silent are 
   discredited. The ones who won't be silent and can't be discredited 
   have been killed over the years.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>Why such extreme measures to deny to 
   the general population that extra-terrestrials exist?</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>Sadly, it is all about power and 
   control. The individuals in authority realize that contact with an 
   extra-terrestrial civilization would diminish their power.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>On Earth, power is associated with 
   resources. If you have a desirable resource, something that others 
   want or need to live, you have power. You can dictate the terms of 
   dispensing that resource. If you gauge it or price it, as the case 
   may be, correctly, you can have an unlimited source of power. 
   However, if you excessively restrict or overprice the resource, then 
   people are likely to attempt to take it. So the resource controllers 
   constantly work to get the most the market will bear without the 
   consumers being compelled to take the resource.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>This is the basis of power and 
   control on Earth; resource control.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>So what does this have to do with 
   hiding the existence of extra-terrestrial civilizations?</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>It comes down to one word, ENERGY.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>On Earth, dispensing energy is big 
   business. If you add it all up, most of your income goes for 
   electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, propane, etc. And gasoline. In 
   over 100 years, there has not been one thing done to improve the 
   efficiency of any fuel or electric consumption simply because they 
   want you to use more, not less.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>Most advanced extra-terrestrial 
   civilizations have tapped into the universal energy stream or have a 
   fuel system that is so efficient, there is no drain on resources 
   whatsoever. For example, a number of extra-terrestrial space craft 
   are powered by anti-matter engines that inject a single atom of 
   hydrogen stripped of it's electron to produce vast amounts of power 
   to travel though out the galaxy. Hydrogen is very common.(This is why 
   there are reports of UFOs hovering over lakes)</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>For power more like Earth has for 
   domestic use, a resonance device is used to tap into the planetary 
   energy. This is the same energy that produces the massive power of 
   lightening. The resonance device to run the typical Earth household 
   would be about the size of a quarter. Plug it in and no more electric 
   bill. Put it in an electric car, no more gasoline bill.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>The extra-terrestrial civilizations, 
   who do not operate on the money principle by the way, would gladly 
   share what they consider basic technology such as the resonance 
   device. I doubt that they would want to hand over the awesome power 
   of the anti-matter engine but think of all the benefits the resonance 
   device would have. It would improve everyone's life on the planet. 
   Unlimited free electricity ANYWHERE in the world.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>So, there are two big things right 
   there, free electricity and, with electric cars free &quot;electric 
   gasoline&quot;, that authority figures would want to keep away from 
   people. Sad isn't it.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>Nikola Tesla worked his entire life 
   in an attempt to get the resonance device to people. Of course, most 
   people today don't have a clue as to who Tesla is.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>Nikola Tesla created and implemented 
   the AC power grid that is still used today over 100 years later with 
   no modifications. He invented the radio, which Marconi falsely 
   claimed. You hear about Marconi today as the inventor of the radio 
   but not that Tesla went to court against Marconi and won. He invented 
   florescent lighting and has over 1500 patents for various inventions.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>For Tesla, the AC power grid was a 
   temporary step to get electrical devices to people quickly. He then 
   started working on the resonance device. However, he ran into a big 
   problem. When his chief financial backer, J. P. Morgan, found out 
   what the goal of the research was, he stopped funding and then spent 
   the rest of his life sabotaging Tesla's work. His comment, &quot;I 
   can't put a meter on it!&quot; Over a hundred years later, we are 
   still connected to a meter controlled by an industry that has no 
   interest in making anything better.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>This is one reason why the existence 
   of extra-terrestrials is denied; their technology would eliminate a 
   large source of power.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR=#00007F>For fascinating reading, I would 
   suggest that you read about Nikola Tesla and his work.</FONT></FONT><br>&nbsp;
