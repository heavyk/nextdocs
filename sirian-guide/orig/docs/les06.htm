   <FONT SIZE=4>ASTRAL SPHERE/PLANE</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The word ASTRAL was a word used by Chaldean Mages to 
   refer to any state of consciousness or matter that was other than 
   physical. Its literal meaning was starry and the term is still used 
   today in your astronomy. If you should read any old mystical 
   literature you will need to keep that in MIND.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The ASTRAL to us is the plane responding to the 
   radiation of the SECOND RAY. Its lowest manifestation is that of the 
   emotions. This radiation or wave is produced on the MONADIC plane and 
   activates the BUDDHIC and ASTRAL. In other words the waves cycle is 
   2, 4, and 6.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Therefore the perfected ASTRAL vehicle is to receive 
   information from the 4th and 2nd planes for the use of the 
   personality. It also receives energy from those levels and transmits 
   it into the HEART CENTER.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Between each plane, there is a force field which is 
   sometimes difficult to cross. It is caused by the interaction of the 
   charges set into motion by the two different keytones of the two 
   different planes and by the higher keytone and its adherents moving 
   through and around the lower keytone and its scale of matter. This 
   latter explanation helps create the &quot;Fire by Friction&quot;. You 
   may have already experienced crossing this force field into the 
   ASTRAL. It appears to some as going through a static charge. They see 
   flashes of light and hear the interaction of the charges. Some even 
   feel a mild electrical shock.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Many entities fear the ASTRAL. There is no need to if 
   you have a good guide book and know its seven areas and qualities. 
   Once again, ignorance of the situation is the cause of the fear reactions.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Let me ask all of you if, at this moment, you are afraid 
   of what might happen to you if you project to the ASTRAL plane. Now 
   let me ask if you are afraid since you are on the ASTRAL? You may 
   answer that you are not on the ASTRAL now. Think again. You have a 
   vehicle whose home is on the ASTRAL all the time. Do you believe that 
   it is constantly afraid or in danger? Of course not. The only 
   difference is that you are not consciously focused there so that you 
   are not aware of what happens to it all the time. Consider the amount 
   of information you could acquire and the benefit it would be to you 
   if you could at will use that vehicle consciously. Fear stops you.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Let us review the difference in the levels of the ASTRAL 
   plane. They are divided into three different units. Sublevels one, 
   two, and three form one unit; sublevels four, five, and six form 
   another; and the seventh sublevel forms the final unit.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The seventh sublevel, that closest to the physical, is 
   the part to which people are referring if they have had a loathsome 
   experience upon the ASTRAL. It is the &quot;pits&quot; containing 
   within it all the unconscious horrors and fears that MUN's MIND and 
   emotions can create. It is viscous with dark, dank fear and fog. It 
   is the ultimate horror show and the setting of the &quot;Dungeons and 
   Dragons&quot; game. Some entities' emotional bodies crave fearsome 
   exploits and here they get more than enough. This subplane is 
   automatically avoided by students such as yourselves. You would have 
   to put forth a concerted effort to visit this place.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We will discuss the types of entities that reside on the 
   different levels after we have discussed the scenery.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The next unit up, composed of the sixth, fifth, and 
   fourth, appears much as the physical except the scenes are much more 
   beautiful. The colors and sounds are those that do not exist on the physical.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The topmost ASTRAL unit, composed of the third, second, 
   and first subplanes, is even more beautiful and separation from the 
   physical is becoming evident.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The material of the ASTRAL plane is very malleable to 
   the desires and thoughts of the MUN. If upon death, MUN thinks he is 
   to be in heaven, the ASTRAL obliges complete with angels dancing 
   around a throne. If he fears that he may go to hell, he will wall 
   himself up in a shell of fear and stay that way for ages.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>If the entity has lived a life of extreme selfishness to 
   the point of evil, then he will have to spend time on the seventh 
   level of the ASTRAL serving his time in that dismal place. Aside from 
   that instance, you find almost no evolving entities on that level. 
   Sometimes, if a person is snatched from his body by drugs and is 
   unprepared for it, he will go there. Some nightmares occur when an 
   entity coming through the planes inadvertently makes a stop there. It 
   was this subplane that many ancient initiates had to endure to pass initiation.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The ASTRAL world is peopled by incarnate and 
   disincarnate MUNs and DEVAs. And some of each that no longer require 
   incarnation but are there to teach and help.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When MUN dies to the physical and shortly leaves his 
   etheric, he finds himself on one of the ASTRAL levels that best fits 
   the needs of the lessons he will need to absorb.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>From the lower levels (6th, 5th, 4th) entities can 
   communicate with the physical through a medium. This is the reason 
   for some communication to be of a coarse nature. Mediums should tune 
   themselves to a higher level for meaningful dialogues. The exception 
   is when they have messages for some one physically left behind or 
   when there is something left unfinished.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>On these in between levels the discarnate MUN usually 
   busies himself with existence as if he hasn't even left the physical. 
   He constructs what ever he desires to do so. Finally he will evolve 
   from this isolation, and move into the highest three subplanes; where 
   he will live in beautiful cities with others and some even go to 
   classes being taught by the more evolved.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Something needs to be said here about the incarnated MUN 
   when he is out of body in the sleep state. The great majority hover 
   around, oblivious to the ASTRAL surroundings. If they remember 
   anything, it is as a vague dream. Some of these dreams aren't even of 
   their own. They may have simply passed through someone else's thoughtforms.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>For the MUN that can consciously project his vehicles, 
   the ASTRAL is merely the crawl before the walk within the MENTAL 
   plane and the run in the BUDDHIC and the soaring within the ATMIC.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As you learn the &quot;raising on the planes&quot;, take 
   care not to become enamored with the ASTRAL in that you do not try to 
   go higher. Usually, if a person has no tasks or services to perform 
   within the ASTRAL they will become bored with it rather hurriedly and 
   seek to go higher anyway.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>PATHS OF RETURN</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>There are seven major paths of return corresponding, of 
   course, to the seven rays. The ray types are actually psychological 
   types in that the ray qualifies the thought and emotional processes.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>There exist a method or path that is easiest for each 
   particular ray. A MUN will usually find his ray's path and blend it 
   with whatever ray is in power at the time to come up with the easiest method.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>For the past 2000 years (until 1900), the SIXTH RAY was 
   in power. Its path of return is idealism and/or devotion. The SIXTH 
   RAY, as you recall, rules the sixth plane the ASTRAL. the emotions. 
   Now, for the MUN, emotions are the prime motivation. And even for 
   those who have transcended the MUN world, if they are to create on 
   the physical plane, they have to seek the &quot;vital energy&quot; on 
   the ASTRAL.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The problem is that it takes a fairly evolved entity to 
   have rule over the negative emotions. Remember it is the second 
   initiation that signifies this. For the last two thousand years the 
   SIXTH RAY heightened emotion on a MUNkind that was sadly lacking in 
   control. But from errors we learn. The ideals became dogmas that wars 
   were fought over. Intolerance for other thoughts was rampant. 
   Maniacal fanaticism and blind emotional following were the norm. This 
   does not speak badly of the SIXTH RAY, only of the unthinking hordes.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The last time the SEVENTH RAY was in power, before now, 
   was Atlantis. The path of this ray has come down to you being called 
   MAGIC (In the present we would call it SCIENCE). Of course during the 
   reign of the SIXTH RAY, MAGIC was maligned, followers were cruelly 
   murdered, and all texts that could be found were either confiscated 
   for the churches own use or burned. But the SEVENTH RAY rules the 
   physical plane and it could not be expunged from the Atlantean 
   memories. Also, there is just too much physical evidence of a better 
   time (the pyramids, stone circles &amp;c.) for man to be able to forget.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Since the SEVENTH RAY is back in power and will wax for 
   the next thousand years before waning, it will be necessary for you 
   to be able to work with it. It will also be necessary for a form of 
   magical return to be developed for the coming generations.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Then you ask: what is MAGIC? And rightly so. In order to 
   explain what it was, we we'll have to discuss the nature of MUNkind 
   at the commencement of Atlantis.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Munkind on the planet Earth was greatly behind the 
   schedule of the solar system. The planet had actually been aborted 
   once before the remains of which are the moon. The intergalactic 
   council, around 50,000 B.C., ask their members for &quot;Peace 
   Corps&quot; volunteers to come to earth to raise its consciousness 
   level by integrating into their planet as teachers; keepers; 
   overseers &amp;c. If all else failed, they would ask for volunteers 
   to incarnate into MUN vehicles and work a &quot;Trojan Horse.&quot;</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why all the bother&quot;, you ask. This cannot be 
   revealed by us; although it is within your memory storage banks and 
   when you want to remember you can.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When the volunteers arrived, they developed a method for 
   consciousness expansion that took into consideration the lack of a 
   functioning concrete mind and the ray that was in power which was the 
   SEVENTH RAY. MAGIC was their psychology, teaching aid, and science.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>SEVENTH RAY causes substance to conform to the needs of 
   the life that is to inhabit it. Whether it is a ceremonial form or a 
   body. If an entity wishes to acquire enlightenment and he is 
   following the SEVENTH RAY path, he will carefully construct a plan of 
   living conforming all his actions, using devotion to this purpose, 
   and culminating it in a ceremony to invoke conscious</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>conversation with his soul. His life becomes a living, 
   holy ceremony to celebrate his divinity. You may be assured that the 
   Cheops pyramid is a ceremonial law of order in stone.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The Atlantean MUNkind, as mentioned, did not have a 
   developed concrete mind and could not think what you call logically 
   or rationally. The door had not yet been closed on the ASTRAL plane 
   and they dwelt there as much as on physical. They were not able to 
   distinguish the two.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When the teachers taught them, they simply materialized 
   the object physically or astrally. If you were to teach them about a 
   bear, you materialized a bear for them to play with. Being child 
   like, you did not reason with them about their anger, you 
   materialized a copy of themselves to see being angry for them to 
   learn from. When the psychologist there spoke of integrating a 
   personality, he really meant integrating a batch of materialized 
   selves for the MUN to see, and when the MUN would allow them to 
   seemingly re-enter him, he was changed.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Please accustom yourself to the SEVENTH RAY and to 
   Atlantis for you will be dealing with both. The methods used will be 
   for a more developed race of MUNs, but reactivation of old habits can 
   be unnecessarily painful.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We will discuss the other ray methods as combined with 
   the seventh soon.</FONT>
