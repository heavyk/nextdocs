  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Greetings to those of you along the <B>PATH.</B> I am 
   Djwal Kuhl referred to by many as D.K. ........</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Many of you in this room are now facing a <B>THRESHOLD</B> 
   level on the <B>PATH</B>. This level can be viewed as a rise that one 
   passes over with a bit of a plateau beyond it. Up to the point of the <B>PATH</B> 
   where this rise and plateau exist, man can always look back and see 
   the ground covered. That ground has meaning to them and so when many 
   students of the <B>PATH</B> reach this threshold, they tend to hesitate.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The past has always been a source of security for them; 
   it's always been there and once they make the crossing of the <B>THRESHOLD</B>,
    there is a separation from the past. You are accepting the greater 
   part of yourself at this <B>THRESHOLD</B> in which your past becomes 
   one of many pasts. These changes are difficult for the personality. 
   It's truly accepting a different perspective on the nature of reality 
   but it is an important step forward on the <B>PATH</B> back to the <B>SOURCE</B>.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We have seen many that have approached this <B>THRESHOLD</B>,
    bent over, looked through it and backed up. Some might even run in 
   the opposite direction losing the ground that they had already 
   covered. We feel that perhaps an explanation of what occurs at this 
   point would help your consciousnesses to understand what occurs and 
   perhaps to consciously go forth.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Society, Western Society, starts off an individual at 
   birth by a mysterious process that's ambiguously labeled as being 
   made by God, but no one really knows what that means or what comes 
   before. And so the assumption made is that you've got a fresh soul or 
   fresh entity; that nothing came before. And this is reinforced daily 
   throughout the life of the individual.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>What this tends to do is to augment that portion of the 
   mind that you refer to as the Anti-Self or the Preconscious. It 
   views, and forces your consciousness to view, its' point of origin at 
   conception; when the human gametes meet and fuse. Hence it makes the 
   mundane experiences the primary focus of its' reality. And so you see 
   this in your day to day lives: jobs are important; relationships of 
   some nature are important; houses are important; other types of 
   possessions are important. What is lost in importance is the <B>INDIVIDUAL</B>.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>For you see for many hundreds of years now the validity 
   or integrity of the individual has been obscured. People are trained 
   to do things, to get themselves into situations, that tears apart 
   their individuality; that compromises their essence. And all along 
   the early part of the <B>PATH</B> this is evident and it's very 
   difficult for the individual to climb out of the various holes and 
   landslides at this portion of the <B>PATH</B>. Numerous entities 
   spend unnecessary lifetimes at the base of the incline, whether it be 
   motivated by emotion, materialism, the need to possess or be 
   possessed; the aspects that impair the identity of the <B>INDIVIDUAL</B>.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Climbing up the <B>PATH</B>, as many of you have been 
   doing rapidly lately, has not been easy. Many of you are dealing 
   right now with physical plane situations that are very uncomfortable; 
   very unpleasant. This is part, and the hardest part, [of] crossing 
   through the <B>THRESHOLD</B>. A good while back it was said by one of 
   my colleagues that there were many sources of assistance on the <B>PATH</B>,
    if you would but look for them. I urge you to avail yourself of 
   these forms of assistance. It is important that you push emotion 
   aside as much as possible so that you can objectively assess where 
   you are now, where you were and where you are going.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The NEW AGE is not going to happen by itself. The New 
   Age is to be brought in by individuals who have made the seeming 
   physical plane sacrifice and crossed the <B>THRESHOLD</B> to see a 
   glimpse of the greater picture. It's going to require a great deal of 
   effort but many of your entities have been working on this for tens 
   of thousands of years; it's not a new project with you. But where 
   each of you stand today, damage has been done to your personalities. 
   This damage is in the form of self destructive tendencies and 
   limiting beliefs.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Some of you will not make this crossing to continue the 
   development; the choice is yours. Many of you will make it and the 
   rewards will be many: the bond, the unity will be greater than you 
   have ever known up to this point in your life. For you see 
   resurrecting the <B>INDIVIDUAL</B> opens the door to rejoining the <B>ONE</B>.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And so we would suggest that each commune as a whole, 
   avail yourselves of the resources around you. Do not let the 
   temporary disruptions of the physical plane divert you from what you 
   came here to do. Do not let the enticement of the past force you to 
   run back down the hill and lose the ground that you have worked so 
   hard to gain. Do not let your Anti-Self force you into reactions that 
   are not of benefit to the whole.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Each of you here know that you have a purpose and you 
   know what that purpose is, although many of your consciousnesses 
   cannot accept it yet. To many of you the task seems impossible but 
   this is not true. What you as a group can accomplish has been done 
   many times in many other areas of endeavor. The difference is what we 
   as the non-physicals and you as our physical plane representatives 
   are working to accomplish will for the first time in the history of 
   this planet force individuals to face themselves; find themselves; 
   accept responsibility for themselves and move forth, back to the 
   union of the <B>SOURCE</B>. This is necessary. This is something that 
   each of you are capable of doing. You must believe in yourselves and 
   believe in your co-workers in the endeavor.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We feel that it is unfortunate that you have to be 
   restricted in physical bodies; to have to feel your way through dense 
   matter. But this was decided long ago, that that was the only way 
   that humanity could achieve their freedom. They had to respond to 
   someone that was on their plane, that could move about within their 
   reality and that's why you are here.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>....... Each and everyone is more important than you 
   will ever consciously accept but you have to believe in yourself and 
   believe in your purpose. And work together to accomplish this purpose.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>....... We will help in whatever ways we can and we 
   invite you to call upon us whenever there is a need. We are always 
   ready to serve. SO BE IT. And may your crossing of the <B>THRESHOLD</B> 
   be soon and painless. Good evening.</FONT>
