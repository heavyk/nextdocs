  </P>
  <P>
   My dear children and beloved colleagues. Tonight we shall continue 
   our saga of how the physical plane came to be. If you recall the last 
   time, I mentioned that the Solar System around Sol was chosen as an 
   isolation point. Now to fill in the gaps between the time the 
   decision was made for that and the time the isolation ward was 
   actually put into operation.
  </P>
  <P>
   The entities that existed at the Astral level did not die or become 
   altered in the usual sense of the word, they were shadow figures to 
   the terms that your physical senses would perceive them. So the 
   infected entities could serve no more than a nuisance to their fellow 
   entities. They continued looking for new territory to infect, and all 
   the time there was a small percentage of their fellow entities that 
   fell victim to their disease.
  </P>
  <P>
   The creators decided on a bold course of action. And that was to 
   descend amongst their creations in an attempt to rehabilitate them. 
   Where the creators come from, the level at which they exist, there is 
   no physical form. It is simply spheres of various colored energies. 
   Energy spheres; that is their form, colored according to their 
   frequency and illuminated according to their magnitude.
  </P>
  <P>
   And so the first step in dealing with the infected ones was for the 
   creators to lower their vibrational level so that they could descend 
   and assume the Astral form that was common among the entities of the 
   lower planes.
  </P>
  <P>
   And over a long period of time this was done and the creators 
   descended and began the process of collecting up the infected 
   entities for rehabilitation purposes. However this was a monumental 
   task because they [the infected ones] continued to spread themselves 
   out around the Universe in many different Galaxies. And always, a 
   small percentage of the inhabitants would be infected. Thus their 
   numbers continued to grow. This is what necessitated the creation of 
   the physical plane. The filter needed to be created to check the 
   spread [of the infected ones] around the Universe. And the way this 
   was initially done was by taking entities that were not infected, 
   volunteers [from the Astral], slowing down their vibrations to the 
   point that they could inhabit what became the physical plane. And so 
   this physical plane was set up as a big trap essentially, and to be 
   of significance it had to take on the proportions of a Galaxy. And so 
   the Galaxy of which Sol is a part was created with Sol and the 
   surrounding planets intentionally being left uninhabited.
  </P>
  <P>
   Those entities that chose to give up their Astral existence were 
   populated on Solar Systems a far distance from Sol. And in order for 
   the trap to be set, they were to create civilizations and make 
   developments that would be appealing to the INFECTED ONES. It was 
   taken into consideration that a long period of time would elapse 
   before the INFECTED ONES took notice of this new development in the 
   Universe. They were so tied up in trying to be all powerful; to 
   establish dictatorships among entities upon whom it would not work; 
   that the whole system was created without their knowledge.
  </P>
  <P>
   The original inhabitants of this Galaxy were not infected and they 
   developed their physical plane civilizations to a high degree. But as 
   many variables fit into the situation, they branched off into two 
   forms; two types of civilizations. One type of civilization was 
   highly spiritually advanced as well as technically advanced. The 
   other civilization was highly technically advanced but more 
   materially oriented. They inhabited these new vehicles and discovered 
   that the physical plane was limiting in terms of how they had to 
   interact among themselves and how they had to create more of 
   themselves. Before, they did not have to create themselves; they 
   lived indefinitely. Now they were faced with the task of creating new 
   vehicles to allow more entities the opportunity to exist and this was 
   part of the plan.
  </P>
  <P>
   In the interim, the creators spent a great deal of time collecting up 
   such INFECTED ONES as could be located and worked to rehabilitate 
   them. Finally the trap was set. Both types of civilizations had 
   millions, I should say billions of inhabitants, billions of vehicles, 
   and a technology the power of which is difficult for an Earth person 
   to comprehend.
  </P>
  <P>
   This attracted the notice of the INFECTED ONES as it was planned and 
   &quot;word&quot; spread quickly. Here were beings that existed that 
   were of a lower vibration than themselves. Prior to this time, if you 
   will recall, everyone was equal and they [the INFECTED ONES] could be 
   nothing more than pests to their fellow entities on the Astral that 
   were not susceptible to their disease. But now a new variable had 
   entered into the picture and they immediately desired to capitalize 
   upon it. They started pouring into the Galaxy of the physical plane.
  </P>
  <P>
   Their plan was to overwhelm and rule the supposedly 
   &quot;inferior&quot; beings. They viewed them as inferior because 
   their vibrational level was lower than that of their own. What they 
   didn't realize in their shortsightedness was that in actuality, the 
   vibrational level of these physical beings was very similar to their 
   own; just a bit lower.
  </P>
  <P>
   And so almost overnight, so to speak, the difficulty in the rest of 
   the Universe was resolved because the majority of the INFECTED ONES 
   immediately sped to the new physical plane Galaxy intending to 
   &quot;Rule from Above&quot;.
  </P>
  <P>
   The creators, as had been planned previously, left a small portion of 
   themselves to patrol the other Galaxies, to pick up stragglers and 
   the majority of them migrated to the new Galaxy. They continued to 
   remain at this level that they had chosen analogous to the Astral 
   level and collect up the now concentrated infected entities.
  </P>
  <P>
   In their lust for power and in their GREED, the first target of these 
   INFECTED ONES was the Spiritually and Technologically advanced 
   civilizations because they were by far the most powerful. The wisdom 
   tempered from Spirituality allowed them to create great powers 
   because they had the wisdom necessary to justly use such powers. And 
   so, like a horde of mosquitoes, the INFECTED ONES descended upon 
   these civilizations. But to their rue and dismay, they discovered 
   that not only could these Spiritually advanced beings see them, but 
   they could expel them and this they did over and over again. The 
   INFECTED ONES, in their shortsightedness, could not believe that 
   these lower vibrational frequency beings could see them much less get 
   rid of them. They spent a great deal of time trying to influence and 
   affect these entities but it was to no avail. These entities as one 
   in their Spirituality; they were united. The numerous civilizations 
   that existed on various solar systems effectively repelled these 
   INFECTED ONES. And in the mean time, the creators continued to 
   collect them up. So after a while the INFECTED ONES gave up. They 
   realized the futility of their actions.
  </P>
  <P>
   They set their sights on the Technologically advanced civilizations. 
   These civilizations were not as powerful as the spiritually advanced 
   ones, because they did not have the wisdom to handle such power, but 
   they were vastly powerful compared to Earth standards. They had 
   developed inter-Solar System space travel and they traded amongst 
   themselves in the various Solar Systems. And so obviously, their 
   method of transportation was vastly superior to what humanity has 
   developed today because they did not spend dozens of years traveling 
   to the closest planet. They went to other solar systems.
  </P>
  <P>
   However, due to their line of development, they did not interact with 
   the Spiritually advanced civilizations. They could not handle the 
   magnitude of the energy that those beings represented; it was too 
   much for their level of development. So once again the swarm of 
   INFECTED ONES descended but this time they discovered that there was 
   no opposition to their presence. These beings could not perceive 
   them; they could not realize that the INFECTED ONES were trying to 
   influence them. But the INFECTED ONES plan was impeded by the 
   structure that these materialistic societies had developed.
  </P>
  <P>
   They operated mainly on form and tradition and the tradition extended 
   back for millennia. They were not war-like because they knew of the 
   destruction that war results in. And so their greatest pride was 
   their material creations and they had a unilateral agreement amongst 
   themselves that they would not destroy each others creations. The 
   INFECTED ONES tried their best to influence but it was difficult for 
   them to do so. Tradition and form outweighed their singular 
   influence. But they discovered a problem that they hadn't foreseen. 
   And that is, if they weren't careful, they were pulled into physical 
   bodies that were entering into the birth process.
  </P>
  <P>
   This was accidental; it was not what they intended. How could they 
   &quot;Rule from on High&quot; if they were down there amongst their 
   subjects? But then they discovered that by so doing, they could evade 
   the influence of the creators who were persistently collecting them 
   up so that they were not allowed to be nuisances and, whether they 
   wanted to submit or not, were working to rehabilitate them so they 
   would overcome their disease. And what initially began as a trickle 
   quickly became a flood as the INFECTED ONES dove into the new 
   physical vehicles en masse. They were escaping from their perspective.
  </P>
  <P>
   And so it once again became time for the creators to make a change. 
   They would have to pursue the INFECTED ONES at their own level. Again 
   it was decided that a portion would remain non-physical and continue 
   the task of scooping up those INFECTED ONES that had not made it into 
   physical vehicles. And so the creators set about finding a 
   civilization whose vehicles were sufficiently sturdy to handle their energies.
  </P>
  <P>
   In the meantime the INFECTED ONES descended upon the unsuspecting 
   technologically advanced civilizations with the enthusiasm of a city 
   con man rousting a tourist from the country. They fought each other 
   over the opportunity to get into families that had positions of 
   influence. I say positions of influence because there were no 
   positions of power in these civilizations. As in other parts of the 
   Universe, they coordinated themselves on a council system and 
   everyone was equal. But when you have billions of inhabitants, you 
   need a representative group to co-ordinate things and these councils 
   were constructed of the wisest of the wise. And in many instances the 
   children of the council members, after much training, assumed their 
   parents position. Bear in mind that the councils were made up of both 
   male and female members because there was no such thing as sexual 
   discrimination and there was no such thing as racial discrimination. 
   Because, yes, among these technologically advanced civilizations, 
   there were different body types depending on the conditions of the 
   Solar Systems in which the civilizations existed. The bodies took on 
   different characteristics and there was a variance from Solar System 
   to Solar System, and in many instances, from inhabited planet to 
   inhabited planet within a given Solar System. And so the INFECTED 
   ONES entered in and at first, their memories were clear in terms of 
   who they were and they stealthily set about to influence the 
   civilizations of which they had become a part.
  </P>
  <P>
   The people of these civilizations did not realize that they had been 
   infiltrated by entities that were not of their own; entities with a 
   subversive purpose. And thus over time, these entities matured and 
   worked to influence the councils. They did so by altering tradition a 
   little at a time over long spans of time; and interjecting new 
   elements into the societies that were very susceptible to them. The 
   societies were ordered on material creations and [initially] dealing 
   with people in terms of equality, but it was the material 
   orientations that opened the door to the problems that the INFECTED 
   ONES interjected. And so now perhaps you have a view of Pandora's 
   box, the box contained the INFECTED ONES and they descended upon 
   unsuspecting civilizations.
  </P>
  <P>
   The INFECTED ONES worked their task in a manner similar to the way 
   they operate in the present. The first task was to cause the creation 
   of weapons of destruction. Prior to this time such was unnecessary 
   because all the civilizations of the technological group agreed that 
   they did not want to destroy each others creations. They realized 
   that in each of the Solar Systems resources existed that needed to be 
   shared amongst all the technologically advanced civilizations. And 
   this is why they had developed their rapid mode of space travel.
  </P>
  <P>
   But now a new element was interjected into all the civilizations and 
   it had various impacts at various times. Planetary Nationalism was 
   the guise that was used. Weapons for defense; what if another planet 
   or another Solar System decided to come in and, rather than trading 
   for the resources, take them instead? It had never happened before 
   but the INFECTED ONES were creating the doubt; creating the distrust. 
   In other words, implanting their own disease upon the inhabitants. 
   And working within the system, they began to manipulate it on many 
   different planets in many different Solar Systems.
  </P>
  <P>
   And so the councils could see no reason not to be cautious; to have 
   weapons for defense. It was authorized that such weapons were to be 
   created and these weapons were indeed powerful; you could look at 
   them in terms of &quot;DOOMSDAY&quot; weapon, because they could 
   annihilate entire civilizations and destroy entire planets. Such was 
   the power that these technologically advanced entities had tapped. 
   But compared to the destruction of planets, the 
   Spiritually/Technologically advanced civilizations had developed or 
   tapped a power that could destroy the entire Galaxy. So from an Earth 
   perspective, the Technologically advanced civilizations were potent, 
   but compared to the Spiritually advanced civilizations they were 
   still a drop in the bucket. You can see why the INFECTED ONES had 
   tried to assault those civilizations first.
  </P>
  <P>
   And the wars began. Interplanetary and inter-Solar System wars. In 
   some Solar Systems the planets fought amongst themselves. In other 
   Solar Systems, they joined together to attack other civilizations in 
   other Solar Systems. Billions of people or physical vehicles were 
   destroyed; numerous planets ceased to exist; entire Solar Systems 
   were destroyed. This went on until there where only two major 
   civilizations left, each on opposing sides of the Galaxy. The shear 
   distance and the need to recover their losses initiated the peace 
   that then existed.
  </P>
  <P>
   The creators had quickly discovered that they could not use the 
   physical vehicles of the Technologically advanced civilizations; they 
   could not withstand their energy. This was the converse of what the 
   INFECTED ONES had experienced. And so the creators had to sort 
   through the various Spiritually/Technologically advanced 
   civilizations to find bodies that would be most suitable. Finally 
   they found one that was a most likely candidate. These physical 
   vehicles were quite durable; quite hardy; they easily could function 
   quite nicely up to 10,000 Earth years. And so the creators approached 
   the council of this Spiritually developed civilization and discussed 
   with them the peril that existed in the Galaxy. This council well 
   remembered the threat that they had thwarted ages past, and were more 
   than willing to allow the creators to use the physical vehicles of 
   their civilization as vehicles for manifestation on the physical 
   plane. Analyzing the situation, it was discovered that in addition to 
   being wasteful of time, it would be impossible for the creators to 
   enter or incarnate into these vehicles in the normal manner.
  </P>
  <P>
   What would have to occur was an exchange with the inhabitant of a 
   particular physical vehicle. The incarnating entity would vacate it 
   and the creator would be spliced into it. The difficulty was in 
   finding vehicles that could withstand the energy and were close 
   enough in frequency to be functional. At this point, let me say that 
   all this was occurring simultaneously with the influx of INFECTED 
   ONES into Technologically advanced civilizations, so view this as 
   occurring concomitantly.
  </P>
  <P>
   From the non-physical level, it was very difficult to accurately 
   perceive the necessary requirements and conditions of the physical 
   vehicles in terms of suitability for the newly incarnating creators. 
   And so the process was carried out in a trial and error manner and 
   there were many failures; either the bodies would die instantly; die 
   in a short time; be impaired or damaged beyond function; or the 
   frequency would be off so much that the creator could not manipulate 
   or work the vehicle - similar to being blind, paralyzed or mentally 
   impaired. And so it became imperative that the scientists among the 
   creators have top priority in becoming physicalized; anchored into 
   physical vehicles that were more or less functional. And over a long 
   period of time and numerous attempts, this was finally accomplished. 
   Three were successfully spliced into physical vehicles and they set 
   about the task of creating the equipment necessary to analyze the 
   bodies that existed in terms of frequency and energy carrying 
   capabilities. They determined that approximately 3 percent of the 
   vehicles would be as suitable as possible for the purpose of 
   incarnating the creators physically.
  </P>
  <P>
   [Continue after tape change.]
  </P>
  <P>
   All right, the vehicles of the population contained 3 percent that 
   were more or less suitable. The screening process eliminated the 
   destroyed vehicles of the trial and error process. However, the 
   magnitude of the energies were so great that even the more suitable 
   vehicles were halved in terms of their useful function, which was 
   approximately 5000 Earth years. And so the creators, one by one, were 
   spliced into the vehicles until the group of them resided on the 
   physical plane.
  </P>
  <P>
   It was decided, judging from the length of time necessary to complete 
   the process of accumulating and rehabilitating the infected entities, 
   that a continuation of these [suitable] vehicles was necessary. And 
   so the procedure was adopted that the vehicles were reproduced 
   amongst the creators. [While carrying out] this [reproduction] 
   process, the creators were acclimating to the physical.
  </P>
  <P>
   Now these vehicles that were created as a result of the connection of 
   the creators were not inhabited initially by themselves. Time was too 
   valuable for them to go through the birthing process and have to grow 
   up. An arrangement was made with the incarnating entities of this 
   civilization that they would provide suitable entities to function 
   and mature the vehicles until such time as a switch was necessary. 
   And the creators would simply exchange vehicles or bodies and 
   continue their work without interruption.
  </P>
  <P>
   Once physicalized, the creators adapted to the technology of the 
   civilization of which they had become a part, set about to improve it 
   so that it would be more suitable to their needs and also physically 
   went to observe what was occurring amongst the civilizations that the 
   INFECTED ONES had contaminated.
  </P>
  <P>
   It was very obvious that from the physical standpoint, that it would 
   be impossible for the creators to physically intercept and deal with 
   the physicalized INFECTED ONES. It was also reported from the 
   non-physical creators that a new variable had entered into the 
   picture; when the INFECTED ONES incarnated into physical vehicles, 
   they were altered in such a way that they did not respond [to 
   rehabilitation] on the non-physical level. Their entities could be 
   collected up but it served no useful purpose; they could not be 
   reached for rehabilitation purposes.
  </P>
  <P>
   And the INFECTED ONES had rapidly destroyed their opportunities to 
   incarnate by destroying the civilizations that they had incarnated 
   into. This is a classic case of a parasite destroying its host. They 
   needed the host to perpetuate their greed; their lust for power; 
   their lust for enslavement of peoples; but they destroyed that which 
   they had desired which is a characteristic of their disease - shortsightedness.
  </P>
  <P>
   Knowing the eternal nature of life, the creators were not concerned 
   with the entities' bodies that had been destroyed because they were 
   but a fraction of the total entity. But they were concerned with the 
   fact of the alteration in the INFECTED ONES that did not allow them 
   to be rehabilitated at the non-physical level. And this is where the 
   necessity for the Solar System around Earth came into being.
  </P>
  <P>
   The creators, along with volunteers from the 
   Spiritually/Technologically advanced civilization, formed a coalition 
   to deal with the problem. It was blatantly obvious that it was 
   necessary to deal with it from a physical level.
  </P>
  <P>
   The technologically advanced civilizations did not attempt to attack 
   those that were more powerful than themselves; the Spiritually/Technologically
    advanced civilizations for they knew from ancient tradition that the 
   power that these groups commanded was more than they had even thought 
   about. They could destroy entire Solar Systems, but that was a 
   pittance to the destruction of an entire Galaxy.
  </P>
  <P>
   And so approximately 5 million years ago this coalition was created. 
   Ships were sent to the Solar System to discover planets that were 
   suitable for the purpose. With the technology of this civilization, 
   along with the augmentation of that of the creators, all of the 
   twelve planets around Sol could be used. Some were more suitable than 
   others and a plan was formulated to make the necessary alterations to 
   allow the INFECTED ONES to be lured to the spot. But it was more than 
   that. In addition to the hardware of the Solar System, software 
   needed to be created to, once again, trap the INFECTED ONES.
  </P>
  <P>
   So number one priority was the creation of physical vehicles that 
   functioned at a lower vibration than that of the technological 
   civilizations or what was left of them. The INFECTED ONES would be 
   pulled into these vehicles and there they would have to remain in a 
   constant cycle of incarnations.
  </P>
  <P>
   One of the largest planets in the system was chosen as a base of 
   operation; this was Jupiter. The coalition began the process of 
   creating the material; creating what was needed to establish a base 
   on that planet. This planet was chosen mainly due to its 
   environmental structure; it would be easy to hide on this planet due 
   to the gaseous covering and with the technology it was no problem. 
   The gravity would be neutralized to acceptable levels and artificial 
   atmosphere used. This planet would serve as the focal point for the 
   modifications that needed to be made on the other planets. So many 
   earth years past and this phase of the operation was put into effect.
  </P>
  <P>
   It was discovered that suitable life forms needed to be created in 
   order to serve as an efficient lure and trap for the INFECTED ONES 
   and that was the next priority.
  </P>
  <P>
   At this time Jupiter was the 6th planet from the sun. Plans were made 
   to utilize the resources of the 5th; 4th; and 3rd planet in the next 
   phase of development.
  </P>
  <P>
   And at that we shall rest and continue the Saga of how Earth came to 
   be at our next transmission. We apologize for the length of this 
   session but there was much information that needed to be given; very 
   important information because this story will one day reverberate 
   around the Earth and it will be something that rings true to many people.
  </P>
  <P>
   My blessings upon each and every one of you. Continue your growth; 
   continue to evolve; and be mindful of the energies; make certain that 
   they are utilized properly. So be it.
