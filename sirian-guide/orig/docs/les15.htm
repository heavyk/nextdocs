   <FONT SIZE=4>BUDDHIC PLANE</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The BUDDHIC is the fourth plane, resonates to the FOURTH 
   RAY and is represented by the element fire, which in turn is 
   represented by a triangle or three sided pyramid.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It is the plane where the &quot;web of life&quot; exists 
   for munkind. This web of life has been likened to golden threads 
   going from each entity to all others, so that all are joined. This 
   greatly affects the state of consciousness that is native to this plane.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As you recall, on the ABSTRACT MIND level, you perceived 
   things as they truly are, but your perception was from a point from 
   within yourself as apart from the object being perceived. On the 
   BUDDHIC PLANE, your consciousness perceives from within the object. 
   Unity becomes an experienced fact.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>If you encountered another entity on the BUDDHIC PLANE, 
   you would communicate by uniting consciousness. Each's thoughts and 
   goals would be accessible to the other, as if they belonged to the 
   other, because all are conscious facets of a whole consciousness.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This does not negate individuality, although it destroys 
   aloneness. Entities have their total evolutionary record at their 
   disposal and they are very aware of their own experiences.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When the use of the BUDDHIC vehicle is added to your mun 
   consciousness, it adds a sense; this sense could be called pure 
   empathy; with objects as well as entities. This capacity does not 
   just apply to the mind, but allows for all of one's senses to 
   function from within another as well as from your own vehicles. This 
   is, of course, left to the entities discretion that are involved. One 
   does not use this faculty on an entity that doesn't wish to participate.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This is the level from which most advanced entities that 
   are involved in helping munkind work. The PLANETARY HIERARCHY is 
   polarized here.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The BUDDHIC PLANE, being the second plane from the 
   MONAD, is the receiver and transmitter of SECOND RAY energy from the 
   MONAD. The vehicle thereon is to the MONAD as the emotional or ASTRAL 
   body is to the SOUL.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>A careful consideration of the functioning of the 
   BUDDHIC vehicle can give you an idea as to how the emotional vehicle 
   should become with evolution. We have often stated that the ASTRAL 
   body is a receiver and transmitter of &quot;intelligence&quot;. We 
   use the word intelligence here as a spy group would. In your present 
   state, you pick up data with your ASTRAL; but it is often vague from 
   being muddled by the miasma on the plane, and you are left to wonder 
   what it means, if anything, and where it came from. By direct 
   empathy, all of those problems are eliminated and you can be very 
   sure of your information.</FONT>
