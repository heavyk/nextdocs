            <p><font size="4">I bid you a good evening. Doyle here.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">The need for the resurgence of Spiritualism is 
            great. For many years now, mankind has grown separated from the 
            Spiritual Light. This has left a great void; an emptiness so profound 
            that people are emotional and fearful.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">Man truly does not live by bread alone; the access 
            to the realm of the Spirit is the Spiritualist Circle.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">For many years of my life, I drifted seeking to 
            fill the void in my being. I felt that religion as I had been taught 
            was missing the true essence of Spirituality. I was disillusioned 
            and saddened by it. Yet, although my analytical mind could clearly 
            process facts, I was lacking; my very being was hollow.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">Friends invited me to attend a seance and in good 
            fun, I went. Although undertaken in a lighthearted manner, things 
            revealed themselves that captured my interests. I hardly could believe 
            what had taken place but nonetheless, it had happened. This sent 
            me on my quest to find what was happening.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">My logical mind made the process of revelation 
            a long one but when finally I was convinced, I embraced the Spirituality 
            with all my being.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">People wondered why I was so fervent but then, 
            they were incapable of seeing the depths of analysis over many years 
            that led to my conclusions. I felt that I had finally filled the 
            emptiness of my being and thus, wanted to share this wonderful gift 
            with the world.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">Most people do not realize the powerful intellects 
            that had traversed the same ground as myself and arrived at the 
            same conclusions; life is eternal and we must strive to reach the 
            Spirit from our temporary home on earth.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">After I passed over, I immediately continued my 
            work, this time from Spirit reaching out to those in the physical 
            plane to show them the light.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">In continuation of m work, this article is being 
            written with the assistance of my close friend and fellow worker 
            of the light.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">One of the issues that is prevalent is the fear 
            of Spirit. I am a spirit. I am as I was in life working to bring 
            hope and Spiritual fulfillment to those on the physical plane.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">Is there a need to fear me?</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">It must be pointed out that spirits exist whether 
            people believe in them or not. Also, since spirits exits, why is 
            there a need to be fearful?</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">With that in mind, I wish to discuss an important 
            tool to aid in the task of benefiting from the Spiritual teachers 
            - This is the Spiritualist Circle.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">A circle is never-ending; things loop indefinitely. 
            The purpose of the Spiritualist Circle is to allow energy to build 
            to give the Spirits the necessary energy to manifest.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">A circles can consist of two or more people. The 
            more people the faster the energy can build. It is important that 
            each member of the circle be of a positive, open mind.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">Think of the circle as links in a chain. A negative 
            person is a weak link and will inhibit the flow of energy; the circle 
            will not be a circle. This is why some circles have powerful results 
            and some do not.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">Thus, it is important to only meet with positive 
            people for the purpose of a Spiritualist Circle.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">With that, we shall end for the evening.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4">To be continued.</font></p>
