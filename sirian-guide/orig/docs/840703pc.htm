   <FONT SIZE=4>AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL VIEW OF CREATION - PART FIVE</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>PRESENTED JULY 3, 1984</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>My dear children and beloved colleagues, tonight we 
   shall start the bit of information that is of greatest interest to 
   your consciousnesses. We will present this information slowly and in 
   as much detail as we can get through at this time. It may take us 
   several attempts to get the complete information through due to 
   certain conditions on the Astral Plane at this time.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Where we left off the last time, the Sirians and the 
   incarnate creators had formed a coalition to work together on the 
   physical plane to concentrate and establish the conditions to 
   rehabilitate the INFECTED ONES. The then uninhabited Solar System 
   around Sol was selected to be the primary focal point of this project.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As mentioned before, the coalition sent personnel and 
   equipment to the sixth planet which at that time was Jupiter; an 
   elaborate base was established. As mentioned before, Jupiter was 
   chosen for its central location and its natural environment which was 
   concealing in nature. So this base was established, which took many 
   Earth years to construct.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The two technologically oriented civilizations were 
   still recovering from their losses. They were, at this time, 
   remaining pretty much to themselves, each on opposing sides of the 
   Galaxy. Neither wanting to confront the power of the 
   Spiritually/Technologically advanced civilizations.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And so a plan needed to be formulated to deal with the 
   INFECTED ONES. It was evident that they were satisfied being in the 
   types of physical vehicles that they currently inhabited. It was 
   realized that it would be unlikely that they would knowingly be lured 
   to a vehicle of a lower vibration than that which they currently had. 
   And so the coalition set about devising a plan to, in various phases, 
   lure these entities into this Solar System, and eventually into the 
   lower frequency bodies. The purpose of this, as previously mentioned, 
   was to once again alter their vibrations to a low enough level that 
   they could do little damage to the rest of the Galaxy.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>So the first phase that was required consisted of the 
   creation of a civilization that emulated the technologically advanced 
   ones. This was to get their attention; to focus it on the Solar 
   System around Sol. The planet selected for this endeavor was what you 
   refer to as Mars. Mars at that time was very similar to the Earth. 
   The planets most suitable for life at this time were the Earth, Mars 
   and the planet between Mars and Jupiter which was referred to as 
   Zyron. Mars was selected as the primary point for its removal from 
   the major base on Jupiter and its environmental conditions.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Knowing how the INFECTED ONES operated, the bait had to 
   be quite elaborate with close attention to detail. And so bodies 
   needed to be created for this purpose in the research base on 
   Jupiter. Genetic engineering was used to clone the vehicles that 
   would be used to seed the then lifeless planet of Mars.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Let me qualify at this point. Mars was devoid of animal 
   life as such; it did have plant life. Through genetic engineering, 
   bodies were created from the genetic structure of the coalition. 
   Using the analysis process, the most likely vehicles were selected 
   and additional alterations programmed into the genetic structure. And 
   over time, these vehicles were created and stored. They were clones 
   in the true sense of the word; they had no consciousness; they were 
   artificially reproduced; and artificially kept alive.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>While the research team was developing the inhabitants, 
   another team began the development process on the planet surface 
   itself. Over thousands of years the complete civilization was 
   constructed, lacking only in the people.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>While the teams constructed this artificial civilization 
   if you will, they lived in underground structures concealing their 
   presence. At the same time other teams monitored the movements of the 
   INFECTED ONES; they still weren't venturing out of their own Solar 
   Systems. The INFECTED ONES had to travel a great distance to get to 
   anything since they had devastated everything in their general 
   vicinity and they were still recovering their populations.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When the Martian Project was nearing completion, it 
   became time to prepare the next part of the project, which was the 
   development of the planet Earth. Again, the planet Earth was devoid 
   of life, or animal life; it did have plant life. The teams arrived on 
   the planet and began the process of creating life to populate the 
   planet. This was still 4,750,000 years ago. And so various creatures 
   were created and allowed to run loose to see how they adapted to the 
   environment on the planet. Creatures were created to serve in the 
   long run as a balancing factor and as a food chain because this 
   planet is where the INFECTED ONES would ultimately reside.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As each life form was created it assumed the 
   consciousness of its environment. As has been mentioned, planets have 
   a life system all their own and this created the consciousness or fed 
   into the consciousness of the lower order animals, from the single 
   celled creatures up to the more evolved or advanced vertebrates.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It was decided that over a long period of time, the 
   vehicles that would finally house the INFECTED ONES would be created 
   from the planet itself so that they would be tied to this planet. In 
   this way they would be concentrated, reducing the chance that they 
   would spread. [At the same time], the coalition was taking measures 
   to neutralize the aggressive capabilities of the technologically 
   advanced civilizations that were controlled by the INFECTED ONES.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And so at this point we shall pause. Again draw no 
   conclusions concerning the Earth for you have insufficient data.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>My blessings upon each and everyone of you, hold true to 
   your heritage. Seek that which you are and do not let it be obscured 
   in the muddledness of the physical plane.</FONT>
