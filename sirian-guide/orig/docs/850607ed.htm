   <FONT SIZE=4>KATHUMI PRESENTS AN IMPACT OF ATLANTIS ON THOSE THAT 
   WALK THE PATH</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   A Channeled Presentation on 6-7-1985
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Dear children and beloved colleagues, it is I Kathumi. 
   Tonight rather than continuing dictation upon our monograph, we would 
   like to emphasize a few points that have on numerous occasions been 
   mentioned in the past.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The major point is that you are involved in a war with 
   the forces of darkness. The weapons that the forces of darkness use 
   involve the emotions, involve your own anti-selves. The forces of 
   darkness work to weave illusions, misconceptions and reactions. They 
   work to cloud you, to bury you in turmoil, emotional distress, so 
   that your light is dimmed. They work so that you will not be able to 
   become your true self.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The second point that we would like to emphasize is the 
   ramifications from the time of Atlantis. The Atlantean period was a 
   traumatic one for your type of entity. It is one that has left many 
   emotional scars, many limiting beliefs, many self destructive 
   tendencies that must be overcome before you can succeed in anchoring 
   your higher self into the physical, manifesting your energy and 
   shining your light out to reach those that need your assistance.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Many emotions, many reactions exist from the time of 
   Atlantis. These emotional reactions are not beneficial, they must be 
   dealt with and neutralized. Atlantis is not a pleasant experience to review.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times all 
   interwoven and an intricate play of which each played a key part. It 
   must be overcome now. It must be faced and it must be placed in it's 
   proper perspective. It is not beneficial to allow emotionalism in any 
   form to interfere with your primary purpose on the physical plane. 
   The purpose, ah yes, the all encompassing purpose. Transcending the 
   physical plane, recapturing your spiritual selves so that you can 
   help others to discover theirs, perhaps for the first time. If you 
   allow yourself to be embroiled in emotion; to be embroiled in 
   turmoil; to allow the clouds of darkness to encompass you; to be 
   blinded by emotion; to fall into ruts and reactions from the past, 
   you will not be able to function.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As has been said many times in the past, the middle 
   path, although hard to maintain, is the only way to successfully 
   balance the spiritual and physical. This balance is what humanity 
   cries for. Imbalance is what humanity has. And it is fostered by the 
   black brotherhood and due to patterns from Atlantis and from the 
   beginnings of this Universe, you can be pulled away from the middle path.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The key to this system is &quot;LOVE&quot; and 
   &quot;WISDOM&quot;. Both are necessary and neither must supersede the 
   other. They must be balanced. Objectivity must be maintained.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The energy levels are continuing to rise and will do so 
   on a world wide basis. For those that are not prepared; for those 
   that have rigid beliefs; limiting beliefs; the energies will only 
   amplify what is there. Many will be shattered due to inflexibility. 
   Your past programming; your past learning is your biggest enemy, the 
   enemy within yourself. If you allow the anti portion of your mind to 
   rule you, you will drop into the abyss and defeat yourself. You must 
   work, it is a constant need for you handle more energy due to the 
   nature of your entities. This energy amplifies what is there. 
   Excessive reactions in any sphere are not beneficial. Balance is a 
   necessary requirement or else the extremes will work to decimate you.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We can not lightly view this topic for the stakes are 
   too high and the end results too important to let personalities or 
   emotions ruin that which you must manifest through. The choice, of 
   course, is your own. However, ignoring the past; ignoring reactions; 
   or attempting to rationalize or view them in a form other than what 
   they are, is self defeating. Emotionalism can color and detract from 
   that which is. Physical reality is a collective illusion; however, 
   individual idiosyncrasies can obscure even the flow of the collective illusion.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Contemplate these words, see how they apply to self and 
   look back to the past to see the role that you played in the time and 
   the place referred to as Atlantis. It will not be a pleasant 
   experience for any of you and yet it is the biggest block that you 
   face. And as conditions world wide strongly approach the similarities 
   of Atlantis you will be faced more and more with the reactions of 
   that time. And if you desire a different outcome, if you wish not to 
   be destroyed, which is what occurred then, you must overcome the 
   past; you must view and release the emotions and the reactions from 
   that time.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We feel that this is the most important thing we can say 
   this evening. The black brotherhood has been working strongly to 
   disrupt the flow of the work, we are behind schedule in our 
   endeavors, as are you. However, the time can be made up with 
   appropriate work. But we must again emphasize the fact that the 
   critical components of self and most of the biggest problems that you 
   face lie not with others but within self. And that is what must be 
   faced first. Think upon these things; contemplate them. We must be 
   strong upon this for your personalities are interfering with the work 
   that you came here to do. Your belief structures are interfering with 
   allowing the majesty of your higher selves to shine forth. And this 
   is not helping those that you are here to help.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Do not fall into the pattern of Atlantis and repeat the 
   pettiness and the egotism and the disillusion that was so rampant in 
   that time. Contemplate these things and I shall leave you with these 
   words. My blessings upon each of you. We know it is difficult to 
   overcome the physical self. We sympathize with you and empathize with 
   you but you can not let petty personalities or petty reactions stifle 
   and neutralize what you came here to do. Go in peace, but look at 
   your self; look at where you are at and what you are doing; and ask 
   yourself &quot;why&quot;? It stops with self and it starts with self. 
   It does not start and stop with another. You are ultimately 
   responsible for self and in this sense you are an island. Only when 
   that self is faced and settled the past can you fulfill and 
   experience the love and the wisdom; the balance thereof that is 
   required to serve as a shining light of love and wisdom for those 
   that depend upon you.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Bless you all. SO BE IT.</FONT>
