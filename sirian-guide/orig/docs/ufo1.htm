     Central Alabama - November, 1975
  </P>
  <P>
   In November of 1975, I was out planet watching with a telescope. At 
   this time of year, Jupiter and Saturn are easy to find.
  </P>
  <P>
   It wasn't late, sometime between 11-11:30pm. I noticed a dull yellow 
   light moving across the sky from the East. It was moving 
   South-Southwest. The light was fairly large and in no way resembled a 
   star or planet. It reminded me of a airborne flare but rather than 
   drifting down, it was moving across the sky.
  </P>
  <P>
   The telescope I was using was a refractor, the type that you look 
   through the bottom which makes it easy to find objects. The light 
   looked strange and I wanted to see what it actually was.
  </P>
  <P>
   I used the tube of the telescope to line up on the yellow light. It 
   was moving slow enough that I was able to get it in the telescope's 
   field of view. However, I immediately noticed something strange. When 
   I looked at the large yellow light through the telescope, the yellow 
   light disappeared. Instead, there was a dull gray saucer with two red 
   lights and two green lights on it.
  </P>
  <P>
   At first, I thought I wasn't on the light. However, checking the 
   angle, I was indeed seeing what was making the yellow light. I again 
   looked through the telescope and studied the object. There is no 
   question it was a flying disk. I was seeing it from the side.
  </P>
  <P>
   I was so impressed at seeing this object that I immediately wrote up 
   a report to send to a UFO organization.
  </P>
  <P>
   The next day in the back pages of the newspaper, there was a small 
   article about an FAA observer in a major city to the S-SW of my 
   location that saw the same thing I did and could not identify it. 
   That was the direction I saw the object going. It arrived over the 
   major city about two hours later which meant it was traveling a 
   leisurely 80-90 mph.
  </P>
  <P>
   There is no question that it was a flying disk or what people call a 
   UFO. My report however never got filed. I received the letter back 
   with a forwarding address expired stamp on the envelope.<br><br>&nbsp;
