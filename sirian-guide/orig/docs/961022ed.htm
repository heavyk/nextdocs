   I bid you good evening. Doyle here. 'Tis a bit lacking in the energy 
   this evening as there are few to contribute. However, we shall 
   endeavor to relay the information that is necessary. We shall at 
   least attempt to begin the process.

   I have chosen to speak first for the simple reason that in reference 
   to the historical foundation of genetic engineering in recent times, 
   the key year is the year of my departure from the physical plane 
   which would be 1930.

The information that I need to impart is that in the year 1930 the 
   gray aliens approached Adolph Hitler and made the proposal promising 
   him world control, offering him technological advances, offering him supremacy.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   'Tis obvious that an alien technology, an alien culture, particularly 
   one as alien as the gray beings would be most impressive. Their 
   technological displays, far in advance of anything humanity possesses 
   then or now, was most seductive.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Hitler had a charisma and initially a sense of caring for the plight 
   of the German people who had been unfairly treated after the debacle 
   of the first world war; the war to end all wars.<br>
<br>   This abuse of the general population of the German people opened the 
   door for the gray aliens. They saw it as an opportunity to achieve 
   their goal of establishing a legitimate presence on earth. They knew 
   that the regulators, the keepers of the peace, would stop them from 
   invading or subjugating humanity. But the loophole that they sought 
   consisted of creating a form superior to the human form but being a 
   part of themselves so that they could stake a claim of legitimacy to 
   the planet Earth.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Mr. Hitler was most impressed by their technologies and was led to 
   believe that he would have free access to this technology. Being a 
   brilliant, if not unstable individual, he recognized the potential. 
   This spurred him to establish his network.
<br>&nbsp;
  </P>

Convincing people with power to follow him was a relatively simple 
   task when he displayed proof of the aliens and their technology. For 
   the tough sell cases direct meetings took place with the gray aliens 
   present; obviously a very impactful presentation. His isolated 
   mountain chalet was the meeting site for contact with these gray aliens.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   This was the beginning of his rise to power. And utilizing the 
   individuals in key positions that were impressed by the technology 
   and the mere existence of the gray race was how he managed to achieve 
   power and ultimately a dictatorship over the German people.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The down trodden German people were too willing to follow anyone who 
   offered to feed them, which they were starving, and regain their 
   pride, in which the Germanic population is a very proud people. There 
   would not have been the seeds of the second world war planted if the 
   dignity of the German people had been respected.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Believing that he had full support, full access to the technology and 
   even a promise of direct intervention if necessary, Mr. Hitler 
   proceeded with his plans to eliminate the obstacles to becoming ruler 
   of the world.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   This belief of omnipotence inspired by the gray aliens infused the 
   German people. The animation, the power, the charisma that was a part 
   of this brilliant but unstable personality was spurred to even 
   greater heights by the gray's omnisentience<B>.</B>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   When he spoke to the German people he spoke with conviction. He spoke 
   with the belief that the German people, with the alliance, with gray 
   aliens, were invincible. Mr. Hitler chose as associates, people who 
   had no scruples. He needed people that would do whatever was 
   necessary to eliminate the obstacles in his path to supreme rule. 
   This of course necessitated the murder of thousands of individuals, 
   thousands of his own people, which was done systematically and 
   efficiently. So much so that the world did not realize what was 
   occurring. Even the German people had no conception that many of the 
   key thinking people of their country were disappearing or dying under 
   mysterious circumstances.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   In his discussions with the gray aliens they conveyed to him their 
   need to perpetuate their race. They told him that due to some ailment 
   that all of their race suffered from, that they were dying and they 
   needed to create a being that was part human and part alien to 
   continue their civilization so that they could continue to assist him 
   in the establishment of the Reich.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Having no compassion or concern for the well being of humanity, they 
   utilized their technological resources to identify individuals that 
   would oppose Mr. Hitler's plans. One of the key groups targeted were 
   the psychic individuals, the individual humans who have abilities 
   that fit into the realm of extrasensory perception. These individuals 
   were targeted first as a recruitment tactic but those that refused to 
   cooperate, those that could see the coming storm, the evil 
   foundation, they were ultimately destroyed after they had been 
   drained of all information that could be derived from their psyches 
   before the body died.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The majority chose this route. Only a small percentage of the psychic 
   individuals cooperated with the Nazi regime. However, it was 
   sufficient to ferret out the others. And those that remained in the 
   country when Mr. Hitler took power and could not escape, ultimately 
   were captured and destroyed. In the process much information about 
   past times, other lifetimes, technologies and capacities were 
   exposed. This information was not even available to the gray aliens. 
   They were as intrigued by it as the Nazis.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The Gestapo, the SS had direct contact with the gray beings. Their 
   viciousness is directly related to the enthusiasm that they derived 
   for their invincibility from their supposed allies.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   It was decided that in order to create the hybrid race that the gray 
   aliens who had no technological understanding of human physiology, it 
   was decided that experimentation needed to be accomplished.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The state of medical development in the 1930's was quite limited. 
   Genetic engineering was out of the question. The equipment necessary 
   did not exist. So they needed a large population; they needed a 
   relatively genetically pure population to study. In the course of 
   creating the hybrid that the gray beings wanted, it occurred to Mr. 
   Hitler that perhaps he could create a superior human being as well. 
   This he established as a priority.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   In researching a suitable population pool of a relatively pure 
   genetic code the Jewish population, which was extensive in Europe, 
   was chosen. The prejudices that people maintained against the Jewish 
   race; due to their insistence on genetic purity; as well as their 
   adeptness at economic control and manipulation made them an ideal target.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   When the people of Germany had been starving, the Jewish people 
   continued to flourish due to their own endeavors; due to their own 
   abilities, no doubt. But when a person is starving they tend to 
   resent those that are not. Thus, it was easy to establish the Jewish 
   population as a threat; to target them as an impurity, as the 
   enslavers of the German people.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The German population who had suffered since 1919, were not 
   forgiving, which is understandable when you're starving. They did not 
   mind seeing the Jewish people disposed of their property. They did 
   not mind seeing the people, who led the good life and ate more than 
   enough, taken away out of their midst. The German people never 
   conceptualized the true purpose for the Jewish population being targeted.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   When this occurred a classification system was devised that divided 
   the Jewish prisoners into various categories. The ones that had 
   specific talents that the Nazis could exploit were exploited in that 
   way. The ones that, based on a Nazi evaluation, served no useful 
   purpose, were relegated to the concentration camps for the purpose of 
   experimentation. The nature of this experimentation was crude and 
   quite inhumane. The physical bodies were subjected to every form of 
   abomination that could be devised. This was strictly utilized as a 
   learning tool. The gray aliens needed to know the nature of the human 
   body, how it functioned, what it did, how it reacted. Disassembly was 
   part of that learning process. Unfortunately it was mainly conscious disassembly.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   A great deal of the torture was specifically designed to evaluate the 
   nature of the vehicle; the human body. The starvation that was 
   imposed upon many of the victims was designed to establish the 
   durability of the body. Those that tolerated the deprivation well 
   were then utilized for further, more extensive and destructive experimentation.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Being ignorant of the nature of the genetic code the gray aliens and 
   the humans assisting them had no conception of what they were doing. 
   The gray aliens were simply destroying humans simply to determine the 
   strength and endurance of the bodies.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   It was the humans' idea, that were assisting, to attempt genetic 
   alteration using chemicals. The German people have always excelled in 
   the fields of engineering, be it mechanical or chemical. The logical 
   choice was to find chemicals that would enhance or create a super 
   being that Mr. Hitler had been led to believe could be created. This 
   did not work.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   It was discovered in the course of the dissections in the attempts at 
   altering the genetic structure that the chemicals were ineffective. 
   But they did discover that the human genetic materials of which the 
   gray aliens were most interested, that being the eggs and the sperm 
   of the human beings were visible under the equipment of the day. And 
   the focus ultimately shifted to the creation of a system to preserve 
   the sperm and the eggs. The attempt was made using the Jewish 
   victims. They had to perfect the techniques before they risk their 
   own population. This was accomplished utilizing the chemical 
   engineering expertise of the German people.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   During this period of time the freezing of liquid nitrogen was 
   discovered as a preservation means for the genetic material. Also the 
   separation of the different sperm carrying organisms was discovered 
   using the mechanical expertise of the German engineering mind.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Utilizing this information they started a program in the 
   concentration camps of artificially inseminating females to discover 
   the effects and to see if they could determine or direct the gender 
   of the offspring. This they accomplished and discovered which type of 
   sperm produced which gender of child.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   They also looked into the prospect of zygote splitting, that is, 
   intentionally created duplicates, identical duplicates of the zygote. 
   They achieved this technology quite by accident. They were 
   approaching the entire field in a trial-by-error way. The gray aliens 
   were of no assistance in this matter except to assist in the control 
   of the inmates utilizing their technology. This is why the Jewish 
   prisoners seemed so disinterested in their condition and made no 
   attempts to overthrow the small amount of Nazis that ostensibly were 
   their keepers. They were under the influence of the gray aliens. They 
   didn't even realize it, so insidious is the technology. But literally 
   thousands of them made no attempt to preserve their lives by rising 
   up against their tormentors. Had they done so they ultimately would 
   have succeeded. That is why over six million of them were destroyed.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The mechanics of the Nazi genetic program were simple. Attempting to 
   utilize the technology that existed with their expertise in 
   mechanical and chemical engineering. The mechanical aspect led to 
   zygote splitting and sperm separation. The chemical aspect, after 
   hundreds of thousands of failures ultimately resulted in the capacity 
   to inject cellular material into the zygote and create a duplicate 
   being of the host genetic material.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The Nazis had no idea what they were doing in terms of DNA structure. 
   They simply, through trial and error, discovered that with proper 
   care, the right chemical environment and the right mechanical tools 
   they could inject the material of a cell from one human being into 
   the embryo and it would then reproduce in the way of the host genetic 
   material. They didn't understand because they could not see any more 
   than the macro structures of the cell. And they of course were simply 
   injecting the entire contents into the embryo. They had no idea which 
   of the components actually worked. But through hundreds of thousands 
   of failed experiments they eventually discovered the right chemical 
   balance, the right mechanical technique and equipment, and actually 
   succeeded in creating clones.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The gray aliens in the meantime discovered that their genetic 
   material, as such, was not compatible with human tissue. In other 
   words they could not inject the genetic, or I should say more 
   accurately, the cellular material from a cell into a human embryo and 
   have viability. They decided that they were going to have to approach 
   their hybridization program in a more traditional way.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   They utilized the chemical advancements of the German science in an 
   attempt to create a more suitable host environment much as in today's 
   science, immuno-suppresants are used in organ transplants. The 
   principals were similar and are in use by the gray aliens today. It 
   has taken them many years to come upon the right combination of 
   immuno-suppresants so that their genetic material will bond with the humans.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   However, with the right chemical materials this does occur and once 
   the genetic materials merge the incompatibilities are neutralized or 
   canceled out. It is just under ordinary circumstances that the sperm 
   of the gray aliens will not peaceably exist with the egg of the human 
   female and the sperm of the human male will not peacefully exist with 
   the egg of the gray alien female. The technology was derived at great 
   human suffering; great human loss of life.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   As time passed Mr. Hitler grew more fearful of the gray aliens 
   because they were not giving him the support that he expected. They 
   were not giving him the technology that they promised. It was of 
   course, it was the way it had to be for had they done so the peace 
   keepers would have been upon them and destroyed them. They would have 
   destroyed each group of the gray aliens that had intentionally 
   interfered with the human population.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The gray aliens, when they had discovered a workable although crude 
   solution to their hybridization program, felt that a reduction of the 
   human population was to their advantage. This is why they presented 
   the technology for nuclear weapons to both the German and the 
   American governments.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   They could not create the technology for them. They had to convey the 
   information as best they could and let the humans do it themselves. 
   Again to avoid bringing the wrath of the peace keepers upon them.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   They did not mention to the human beings the toxic nature of the 
   weaponry. It was of little consequence to them for the gray 
   civilization is unaffected due to their genetic structure and 
   physiology. Their frequency is such that radioactivity that is fatal 
   to earth life forms has no effect upon them.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   This was their plan to reduce the populations of the planet, keeping 
   for themselves a pool of humans to use to create their hybrids.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   That is quite where the gray aliens are today. Still seeking to 
   perfect the hybridization program using chemicals and artificial 
   insemination or even, when possible, mechanical sexual intercourse.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   That concludes my presentation. There is much that could be said on 
   the topic. That is no more than an outline. Tonight we shall attempt 
   to connect another entity to discuss the peace keepers role in the 
   genetic engineering process.<br> <br>I bid you good evening.
