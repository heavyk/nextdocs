   This black spot was the strangest thing I have ever seen. Even with 
   current day recall, I have never seen anything like it. The only way 
   I can describe it is like jet black light. If you take a spotlight 
   and shine it on a surface, you have a white beam with a white spot; 
   make that a black beam with a black spot and it describes what it 
   looked like. It is hard to describe but what it was and what it led 
   to was even more difficult to explain.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   This black beam created an opening through solid rock! It was of 
   tremendous size because the 25' diameter ship was dwarfed by the 
   opening. I watched the flat panel console monitor, obviously not an 
   invention in 1956, as the ship entered the black spot. It was dark 
   briefly like going through ink. Then from the center of the monitor 
   out, an image reemerged opening out until there was a panoramic view.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   What a view. We were inside a huge, and I mean HUGE, circular room 
   with flying saucers of every size and configuration parked in various 
   places. There were ships much larger than the one we were in and 
   there were some smaller ones as well. The only analogy I can draw is 
   an airport, or I guess you would call it a spaceport.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The room was cylinder shaped. The walls, floor and ceiling had a 
   shiny black, glass like surface that had a faint orange glow to it. 
   There were no sharp angles anywhere. It was the same in the flying 
   saucer. Where surfaces met, it was rounded. This giant room was the 
   same way.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The ship maneuvered through spaces between the parked ships and 
   ultimately landed. The door opened. It was weird how that door worked 
   because it seemed to not be there one minute and the next, it just materialized.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   This was the first time I had ever been to this place although it 
   appeared that the other passengers had been there before. Everyone, 
   including myself, stood up except for the pilots. I knew I was 
   suppose to stand up but didn't know why. There appeared to be routine 
   to the other passengers. There were several people, three men 
   actually, waiting outside for us.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The man and the woman extra-terrestrial stuck by me and the other 
   kid, I suppose to assist us since we were rather small.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   So we walked down the ramp. I was a little curious about everything 
   there. Because well, the room was gigantic. It was HUGE! There was 
   all different types of ships parked there. I could see some that were 
   exact duplicates of the one we arrived in. Then there were other ones 
   too, different sizes and configurations. My child mind was curious 
   about all this.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   But no one was really talking at this point. One of the three men 
   seemed to be the spokesperson and he said, &quot;Welcome. Let us go 
   to the meeting room.&quot;
  </P>
  <P>
   Before I continue the narrative of this extra-terrestrial contact 
   experience, it is necessary to discuss an unusual but real phenomena 
   that occurs around this group of E. T.s. This is the phenomena of 
   consciousness expansion.
  </P>
  <P>
   This was not explained to me until 1991 when it became necessary to 
   understand why Missing Time occurs and also, why contact experiences 
   with extra-terrestrials of any species are difficult to remember.
  </P>
  <P>
   The life energy field of the least developed extra-terrestrial 
   civilization is significantly greater than that of a human. Human 
   beings, like all life forms in this Galaxy are electromagnetic in 
   nature. If you consider the brain, and its corresponding 
   consciousness as a light bulb on an adjustable dimmer control, it 
   will be easier to understand the phenomena.
  </P>
  <P>
   Under ordinary circumstances, the typical human is at the lowest 
   setting. Rather dim compared to E. T. s. However, the potential for 
   more exist. Some individuals have higher settings with corresponding 
   talents that primitive human science labels as phony or, if being 
   charitable, extrasensory perception. The extra-terrestrials, on the 
   other hand, have their dimmer switch turned way up all the time. They 
   perceive at what they call a tri-level. For humans with a philosophic 
   or Theosophical orientation, that translates to the etheric, astral 
   and mental planes of reality. The E. T. s have a 360 degree field of 
   conscious perception that is spherical in nature. The only analogy I 
   can make about it is that they are aware of EVERYTHING at once, constantly.
  </P>
  <P>
   When a human gets around an extra-terrestrial, the enhanced 
   energy/electromagnetic field of the E. T. has the impact of turning 
   up the humans dimmer so that the consciousness is 
   &quot;brighter&quot;. This pushes the individual's conscious into 
   areas that normally are relegated to the &quot;Subconscious.&quot; 
   This produces a duality effect. The person is &quot;themselves&quot; 
   but they are &quot;more&quot;. I won't digress into the sorts of 
   things that are stored in every individual's subconscious. I will say 
   that the normal individual is incomplete without access to this 
   information. Being around an extra-terrestrial brings out this 
   completeness and the extra-terrestrials respond to the total 
   individual, not the limited view of self that everyone sees in the mirror.
  </P>
  <P>
   It is necessary to understand this in order to understand what 
   happened when this group of human passengers finally reached the 
   meeting room. To understand how two 4 year old kids were functionally 
   equal to two teenagers and a young adult.
  </P>
  <P>
   As I mentioned, the wall, floor and ceiling of this gigantic 
   cylindrical room were shiny black with a strange orange background 
   glow. There were no obvious light sources but everything was brightly 
   illuminated. There were ships of various sizes around but the largest 
   appeared to be only twice as big as the one we arrived in. The 25 
   foot model seemed to be the most common but there was a mixture of 
   larger and smaller craft as well.
  </P>
  <P>
   There were different color striped lines on the floor. My 
   interpretation of them were parking zones.
  </P>
  <P>
   The three extra-terrestrials that greeted us were standing by a 
   rectangular vehicle, a bit larger than a golf cart.
