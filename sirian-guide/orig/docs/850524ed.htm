<META name="description" content="In 1985, Djwhal Kuhl, know to many as DK, presented a series of lectures on a topic that most people would prefer not to think about...death. As he so aptly pointed out, it is an experience that everyone without exceptions will eventually face. The intent of these lectures was to emphasize that life is eternal and what we believe in life determines what we will experience in the afterlife. The message is clear, death is not to be feared, it is a change. It is not the end, it is a beginning.">

   <FONT SIZE=3>[EDITOR'S NOTE: THE FOLLOWING IS A VERBATIM TRANSCRIPT 
   FROM THE SESSION TAPE. WORDS ADDED FOR CLARITY WILL BE IN [ ], WORDS 
   OMITTED WILL BE DENOTED BY ..... THE REST IS JUST AS IT WAS SPOKEN]</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Greetings to you along the path. It is I, D.K. Tonight, 
   although communication conditions are not at the best we shall 
   attempt to continue our transmission of information concerning life 
   after death. The information that we are attempting to transmit at 
   this time concerns what the majority of humanity will discover upon 
   the transition.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>There are three basic conditions that the newly deceased 
   human spirit encounters at the passing over. The first condition is 
   associated with the etheric vehicle and the etheric level of 
   existence. In this condition the individual inhabits a vehicle that 
   is an exact duplicate of their physical one. This creates a great 
   deal of confusion for them for no one can see them, although they can 
   see everyone. They may see their own bodies but not recognize the 
   perspective of being on the outside. Even when one looks in a mirror 
   one cannot truly appreciate the degree of separateness that is 
   encountered when one is no longer attached to the physical body.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And so the person sees, hears, smells, breathes, all of 
   the physical conditions operating, but no one can see them. No one 
   responds to them. They find that their consistency is such that they 
   cannot touch a physical object. Their hands go right through it. This 
   creates more confusion. Most entities in this state are eventually 
   drawn back to their bodies, which in many instances are the cause of 
   much commotion.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Relatives, loved ones, friends of course, in this 
   western society, are drawn to the deceased, the inanimate physical 
   body. This is the focal point. Although the spirit no longer inhabits 
   it, people are programmed to pay honor to the shell. This creates a 
   great deal of anguish for the person, for the entity that is fixated 
   at the etheric level. They see this inanimate body which they 
   recognize as a body, but they cannot identify with it. It does not 
   look like them to them. They look like them. They cannot understand 
   why all the people that they care about, all the people with whom 
   they have associated are creating such a commotion over this dead 
   individual. For they are not dead. But no one will pay attention to them.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Needless to say, the state of consciousness at the 
   etheric level is a confused one. The perceptions are in a sense a 
   combination of physical plane with elements of the astral. This 
   confusion causes the individual to wander in anguish, to appeal to 
   those whom they can clearly see to beg for assistance. There is a 
   strong tendency for them not to see the nonphysical sources of 
   assistance that exist. For they are more oriented to the physical 
   plane than to the spiritual. They perhaps catch glimpses of those who 
   have passed before. However, as in life, as people normally do when 
   such glimpses occur, they are discounted as being imagination or 
   optical illusions. As was mentioned a good deal earlier this is why 
   the tradition of attempting to create a harmonious atmosphere upon 
   the passing over of an individual was originated.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In all there are seven levels that one encounters upon 
   leaving the physical. The two others that are most applicable to 
   people in general are the astral level and the domain of the concrete 
   mind. We shall work to discuss them in greater detail when 
   communication conditions are more conducive to an accurate transmission.</FONT>
