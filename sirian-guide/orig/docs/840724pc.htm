   <FONT SIZE=3>My dear children and beloved colleagues, tonight we 
   shall continue our saga. As we left off the last time, the cloned 
   vehicles were being ferried from the base on Jupiter for storage on 
   Mars. At the same time it was discovered that the humanoid vehicles 
   that had been created on the planet Earth were not suitable for the 
   purpose intended. The team handling that project collected up a 
   number of specimens for further development and the rest of the 
   vehicles had to be terminated. This was recorded in the memory banks 
   of earth as the first destruction of mankind.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The earth research team continued working with the 
   genetic structure improving and refining the vehicles that would 
   eventually contain the consciousnesses of the infected ones, as well 
   as have a planetary consciousness of their own.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As you recall the Martian Project was in secondary 
   phase. It was designed as a transition for the infected ones that had 
   been collected up from the Technologically Advanced Alien 
   Civilizations, so that they would be altered sufficiently so that 
   they would not be able to incarnate back into those civilizations and 
   would have to be incarnated into the planet Earth. Consequently the 
   vehicles created for the Martian Project where incapable of 
   reproduction. Their useful functioning period was roughly two hundred 
   years which was sufficient time for the transition or transformation 
   to affect the incarnating entity.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And thus the animation process began. All the infected 
   entities that had been collected were inserted into vehicles within 
   the citied structures of Mars. All was constructed carefully so that 
   they could not be a danger to themselves or to others. From an 
   outside appearance it looked like a very technologically advanced 
   civilization, but in reality that was a cover, the entities were very 
   limited, it was a situation of maintenance, all they needed was 
   provided and this was the first manifestation of the keeper system. 
   The keepers being comprised of the volunteers from the Sirian culture 
   and the incarnate creators.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It was realized that since the planet Earth was not yet 
   ready as a tertiary stage of isolation that additional clones would 
   have to be continuously created and this kept the Martin Project 
   coordinators quite busy. Not only did they have to maintain the 
   entire system, they had to reproduce for the inhabitants and then 
   when a transition was made it had to be coordinated with the 
   non-physical team so that the entities would continue to be localized.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The planet Mars being a secondary stage still did not 
   completely eliminate the possibility of these entities getting out 
   into the Solar System. And so the termination of the cloned vehicle 
   had to be monitored carefully. It was also deferred for future time 
   when the Technologically Advanced Civilizations would be made aware 
   of the presence of the base on Mars or the civilization on Mars and 
   lured into this system. This went on for a long period of time.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It took the earth project team another million years to 
   suitably construct another prototype vehicle. The genetic engineering 
   process was quite complex, but once again it was discovered that the 
   vehicles were still not adequate. This could only be determined after 
   numerous vehicles had been produced and allowed to function through 
   their natural reproduction cycle.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>With the second batch of prototypes unsuitable it was 
   decided that a different tack needed to be taken. Again specimens 
   where collected and the rest terminated. The second destruction of 
   mankind as recorded in the memory banks. The basic problem with the 
   vehicles was that they were incapable of handling even the 
   transformed infected ones and their level of consciousness was so low 
   that they were nothing more than imbeciles; they functioned; they 
   reproduced; but they could not maintain themselves and they could not 
   house advanced consciousnesses. This was two million years ago.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The solution to the dilemma was hit upon after careful 
   analysis. It was decided that the new vehicles would be 
   fractionalized in terms of a portion of consciousness. And they were 
   divided into units of twelve and so essentially twelve humanoid 
   vehicles would consist of one entity. And over a long period of time 
   these fractions would evolve into individual separate units that 
   would be part of of the planetary consciousness of Earth and when 
   they reached the point that they could handle a greater degree of 
   consciousness, at such time would be the infusion of the infected 
   ones into the cultures.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Interesting effects were being noted by the earth 
   research team. That was that these fractionalized consciousnesses had 
   to interact with each other, join together energy linkages or the 
   entire group of twelve would disintegrate. Somewhat as you would 
   refer to as mental illness in the present. They were divided equally 
   among the sexes, being 6 males and 6 females and they exchanged 
   energies with each other so that the linkages would be formed 
   directly or indirectly among all twelve. This process was allowed to 
   occur for a million years and this group became quite humanoid in nature.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The connection with the planet and these physical 
   vehicles caused a symbiotic relationship; the planet affected them 
   and they affected the planet. The more of them there were, the 
   greater the impact. Thus work was done to keep them spread out as 
   much as possible, because great concentrations of them could produce 
   serious geological consequences.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Approximately 500,000 years ago these consciousnesses 
   had fairly well individualized into the forms that would eventually 
   be suitable. And the goal then became one of making these entities or 
   these new consciousnesses self sufficient. Prior to this time the 
   earth research team had to serve as caretakers and providers of all 
   that was necessary for survival. Genetic improvements were constantly 
   being introduced into the system and different variations were 
   created to cope with different geological and environmental conditions.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The budding young consciousnesses were quite impressed 
   with their caretakers and were very much like children even though 
   the bodies would be considered adults. There was still the problem of 
   oversize, conditions on the planet at this time was so optimal that 
   everything got very large. This was not a problem until the 
   populations began to grow and spread out to various and diverse regions.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Approximately 100,000 years ago the final genetic tune 
   up was introduced into the system, that gave the vehicles the 
   capability of handling advanced evolutionary consciousness. At this 
   point the earth research team began introducing the concepts of 
   civilization; the things necessary for survival and began to withdraw 
   their involvement with the population.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Within a few thousand years there where many diverse 
   cultural groups functioning independently on the planet. However 
   again it was discovered that large concentrations of them produced 
   imbalances in the planet that caused geological upheaval that 
   terminated many vehicles and this pattern has continued unto this day.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It was at this point that the Technologically Advanced 
   Aliens were intentionally made aware of the existence of the group on 
   Mars. They had replenished their numbers sufficiently that they were 
   once again venturing out of their own Solar Systems.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Be advised that a great number of the infected ones had 
   been collected up by this time. And so the populations where not 
   totally composed of the infected ones but the infected ones were in 
   control. And at this point we shall terminate the transmission. My 
   blessings upon each and everyone of you; continue to seek towards the 
   light and move forth on the path back to the source. So be it.</FONT>
