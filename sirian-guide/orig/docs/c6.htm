   For several practice sessions after I first got the movement, the 
   writing consisted of the energetic circles. Then it stopped. Instead, 
   the pen laboriously began to move but rather than writing words, it 
   was drawing symbols that it repeated over and over. Over several more 
   practice sessions, it got proficient at drawing the symbols and was 
   producing them faster. Strangely enough, they were strung together 
   like some sort of sentence.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I assumed that the subconscious had to learn to write English as it 
   was use to symbology. However, I did notice a few unusual things. For 
   one, my arm would get that electric sensation when I sat down to do 
   automatic writing. Another was that I would get tired after a while 
   and my middle back would begin to ache. Posture had nothing to do 
   with it and how can you get tired writing. The fatigue was as if I 
   was doing something strenuous.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Although disappointed that I was not getting words, the symbol 
   strings were getting easier to produce so I was encouraged. I was 
   also intrigued by the fact that they resembled sentences. Some 
   symbols were repeated often while others were not.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Then one evening, a few words started appearing mixed in with the 
   symbols. The symbol writing had progressed to the point where they 
   just quickly formed but with the words, it was back to the 
   laboriously slow movement. It was sort of humorous because it would 
   quickly draw out a few symbols and then slow to a crawl while it 
   slowly formed the letters of words. The words were not initially 
   meaningful. But then words such as hello and hi began to appear.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   This was interesting. Why was my subconscious telling me hello?
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Just like the symbols, the words became easier and then phrases began 
   to appear. Just simple phrases. But I did notice one thing, as the 
   actual writing of words improved, I started feeling like there was 
   someone standing behind me. The feeling got stronger over time to the 
   point where I fully expected to turn around and see someone or 
   something. However, I didn't but it was a source of concern for me 
   because at the time, I didn't know if I could handle it.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   By this time, months had passed. I had rarely missed a practice 
   session because I was curious and wanted to see what would happen 
   next. As the writing improved, it speeded up considerably. The 
   handwriting was not mine.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I also notice another unusual development. Initially, the words would 
   just slowly write themselves out. But over time, the words would form 
   in my mind shortly before they began to write and eventually, entire 
   sentences would form in my mind before they even started.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I assumed that I was doing this although I certainly wasn't operating 
   my hand and pen. This got even stronger. I was getting the sentences, 
   yes more than one, way ahead of the actual writing. So, I decided to 
   try and experiment. The sentence or sentences would plant themselves 
   in my mind and the hand would begin to write. I would let it progress 
   through most of the sentence and then mentally change the sentence 
   that would basically keep repeating itself until the hand had 
   finished writing.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The result? Well, the hand would write up to the point where I had 
   changed the sentence. Then it would stop along with the tingling 
   sensation. Then, a sentence to the effect of, &quot;DON'T DO 
   THAT!&quot; would form in my mind. The tingling sensation would 
   return and the hand would proceed to write the original, not the 
   altered, sentence.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I tried this a number of times with the same result. The hand refused 
   to write what I mentally altered but would gladly write the sentences 
   that were now pre-forming intact in my mind. Before, they had formed 
   a word at a time. Now, it was entire sentences at once. It's hard to 
   describe this sensation.
