On December 17, 2009, I decided to do a brief spirit voice recording session 
            of about 10 minutes. This led to a fascinating experience.
  </P>
            <p>Although it is extremely easy to do recordings for EVP, actually 
            having an EVP is rare. You have to listen through a lot of time 
            to see if anything is there. Most times, there is nothing. You also 
            have to use computer sound editing software to find many of the 
            EVPs that are impossible to hear otherwise.</p>
            <p>On this night, I sat on the couch in the living room, started 
            the digital recorder and ask: &quot;Does any spirit want to speak?&quot;</p>
            <p>I then waited for a couple of minutes. When you are doing EVPs, 
            it's unlikely you will physically hear it even if you get a spirit 
            voice. So, you state your question, wait a while for the response 
            and then go to the next question.</p>
            <p>After about six minutes I said: &quot;If any spirits are here, 
            please give a sign.&quot; Almost immediately, there were two sharp 
            raps on a cabinet close to the couch. I could tell by the tone which 
            cabinet it was. After I finished recording, I got up and attempted 
            to duplicate the raps by knocking on the cabinet. Although the sound 
            was close, I couldn't duplicate the sound with my knuckles.</p>
            <p>I found this every interesting so I was anxious to proof the 
            recording. I loaded the sound file into the computer (digital recorders 
            make this every easy) and opened the file. Using headphones (always 
            preferred) I started listening and didn't hear anything unusual 
            until about 1min 36sec into the recording. At that point, I identified 
            a wave form that sounded like two words. <a href="../SOUNDS/091217_request.wav">HERE 
            IS THE WAVE FORM</a>. What do you think it sounds like?</p>
            <p>To me, it sounded like <a href="../SOUNDS/091217_request.wav">HELP!</a> 
            I boosted it and filtered it to hear it better as the sound was 
            very weak. It was clearly <a href="../SOUNDS/091217_request.wav">HELP</a>! 
            So, using the speakers on the boosted sound segment, I had another 
            person listen without telling them what it said. Again, HELP! was 
            clearly heard. I e-mailed the sound segment to a friend with the 
            question, &quot;What does this sound like to you?&quot; That's all 
            I said in the message. I got back, &quot;Definitely, HELP!&quot;</p>
            <p>While I was working with the sound file, some unusual things 
            went on. There were some more noises and some things fell down without 
            any cause. At this point, me and AnnaLee, who has contributed experiences 
            to this site, decided to have a session to see what the request 
            for <a href="../SOUNDS/091217_request.wav">HELP!</a> was about.</p>
            <p>Tuning in clairvoyantly, I perceived an elderly man, with his 
            face not clearly defined. He was dressed in gray dress pants and 
            a patterned shirt. He was standing there looking confused. The name 
            Ralph was impressed upon my mind.</p>
            <p>Over the years, there have been a few times when I've called 
            for help to assist a spirit that has been stuck or earthbound. The 
            form the helpers take has always been pretty consistent; wise looking 
            entities dressed in various colored robes. But for Ralph, it was 
            different.</p>
            <p>The process started with a brilliant white spot appearing, like 
            a brilliant white spotlight. Out of this light came angels! I was 
            surprised at this as I've never seen such. They were glowing white 
            with, yes, wings. I was musing over this and figured this must be 
            what Ralph expected.</p>
            <p>There were a number of angels but two approached Ralph, who was 
            facing me, and stood by either side of him. I saw him turn his head 
            and look at one, then the other. A smile came over his face. Each 
            angel put a hand on Ralph's shoulders.</p>
            <p>They turned, and started walking to the brilliant white light. 
            About halfway to it, Ralph turned around and said, thank you, thank 
            you, thank you with a smile of relief. They entered into the white 
            light and it closed just like shutting down a spotlight. The experience 
            was over. The atmosphere of the room felt lighter and there were 
            no more strange noises or things falling over that night.</p>
            <p>How did Ralph find my place? Well, I'm located a couple of blocks 
            from a very large, active cemetery. Spirits can see energy and I 
            figured he was attracted to it. He was too confused to speak except 
            to ask for help and then, when his help came, he was focused on 
            literally, getting to the light.</p>
            <p>Ancient cultures had teachings to help people pass over to the 
            other side. Our culture has lost that teaching. How many other Ralph's 
            are there? Probably many, many thousand. At least Ralph found his 
            help and eternal peace!</p>
