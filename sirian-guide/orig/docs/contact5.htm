   The vehicle is resting on the floor and doesn't have wheels. It 
   reminds me of a multi-seat roller coaster car. At the front, there is 
   some sort of control panel with a bench seat behind it wide enough 
   for three adults. There are three more bench seats behind the control seat.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The extra-terrestrial who greeted us seems to be the one to operate 
   the vehicle. He, the host and hostess extra-terrestrials get in the 
   front seat. I and the other kid get in the seat directly behind the 
   control seat. The two teenage girls and young woman take the next to 
   last seat.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The vehicle operates noiselessly. It rises about six inches off the 
   floor. The driver has to take a zig-zaggy course between the various 
   sized flying saucers. There are also numerous people around doing 
   various tasks. It reminds me of the activity at a busy airport. The 
   room is very large because there are numerous craft parked in there 
   without crowding. I have no conception of size but it is HUGE. It 
   would take a long time to walk across the diameter of it.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Where the flying saucer in which we arrived parked, I would say we 
   were about a third of the distance from the point where we were to 
   exit the cylindrical room.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The exits are unusual. They are arched topped, flat bottom tubes 
   branching out from the round room. You can only see them by looking 
   closely as they are slightly lighter in color than the surrounding 
   material, whatever that is. It is definitely NOT normal rock.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   When you reach one of these tunnels, an opening appears. As I 
   mentioned, you can sort of see where they are but there's some sort 
   of covering that seals the tunnel from the hanger activity. As you 
   start to enter, an opening appears. When you enter the tunnel, the 
   seal reappears right behind you. It reminds me of dark smoked 
   Plexiglas. There was no movement. This opening or door was not 
   mechanical. It had some similarities to the door on the flying saucer 
   but visually, it appeared to have a different composition.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   So we enter the tunnel and are silently floating down it in this golf 
   cart like vehicle without wheels. The walls of the tunnel are 
   perfectly smooth. The bottom is flat but there are no sharp edges 
   where the walls meet the flat floor; they are rounded. The top 
   reminds me of the arch of a railroad tunnel but it is perfect and one 
   piece. The absence of any sharp angles seems to be a characteristic 
   of these extra-terrestrials.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The tunnel is illuminated but there is no identifiable source of 
   light. Unlike the large, cylindrical room that was bright, the tunnel 
   light is diffused. However, as we approach the exit, the room beyond 
   is bright again.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The room we entered from the tunnel also appears cylindrical with 
   visible, or open tunnels branching off of it. There are a number of 
   the little shuttle vehicles parked neatly so I assume this was some 
   sort of parking area. The area where they are parked is denoted by a 
   green color.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   To my child mind, this reminds me of a large Tinker toy construction. 
   It is like being inside of a giant, hollow Tinker toy construction.
  </P>
  <P>
   This cylindrical room is much smaller than the &quot;hanger&quot; 
   room. The parking area is right in the center of it. There's various 
   colored tunnels branching off in different directions.
  </P>
  <P>
   The driver parks the shuttle in the parking area. It glides over the 
   floor and then when it parks, it just silently sets itself down and 
   is resting on the floor. The floor is glass-like smooth but not 
   slippery. The area is a greenish-yellow color. The closest color I 
   can compare it to is a bright olive-drab, if such a color exists.
  </P>
  <P>
   There's an orange or reddish-orange tunnel that appears to be our 
   destination. As we all get out of the shuttle and start walking 
   towards this colored tunnel, I'm looking around and noticing there 
   are other tunnels of different colors. There's a red, blue, green and 
   yellow tunnel that I can see. The reddish-orange tunnel that we are 
   walking towards is by the red one.
  </P>
  <P>
   The room is fairly large, I would say about the diameter of a 
   football field. You would think there would be a great many tunnels 
   branching off but there isn't. This cylindrical room is like a 
   connecting hub.
  </P>
  <P>
   We walk to the orange tunnel. It is the same arched shape as the one 
   we rode the shuttle through from the &quot;hanger&quot;. However, it 
   is reddish-orange in color. It seems to be fairly long to my 
   child-mind and reminds me of the typical floor length of a hospital 
   corridor with exits or rooms off to the side on both sides. We enter 
   the tunnel and it is glowing a slightly pulsating reddish-orange. It 
   is very easy to see in this light. It's a very clear light.
  </P>
  <P>
   We go down to maybe the third door or third entrance way on the right 
   and we enter into this little room. And at one end of it, I'm trying 
   to get a sense of the size of the thing. It's approximately 15 feet 
   by 25 feet. It is rectangular but there are no sharp edges. 
   Everything is rounded where it connects. At one end of the room is a 
   screen that looks like a screen you see in a movie theater. It is not 
   a projection screen however. It is like a TV, a BIG TV. An image 
   appears on the screen and it is a male extra-terrestrail greeting us 
   and telling us that we're about to undergo the transformation process.
  </P>
  <P>
   Some portion of my consciousness obviously knows what this means 
   because I am excited by the prospect.
  </P>
  <P>
   Off to the right of the giant screen TV, is a series of cylinders 
   that are the height of the room and about the diameter of telephone 
   booths. There are door size openings, no sharp angles of course, on 
   each of them. I would say there are 5 of them arranged in a row.
  </P>
  <P>
   Each of us instinctively, at least for me, heads for a booth. I enter 
   the booth and the opening disappears behind me. No noise, just 
   suddenly the cylinder is sealed.
