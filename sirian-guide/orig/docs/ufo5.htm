            <p>An unidentified flying object buzzed around 20 minutes over the 
            southern tip of Florida one morning several weeks ago and then left 
            at a speed of 4,000 miles an hour - or at least a radar screen indicated 
            one did.</p>
            <p>Donald Freestone, a radar operator for Pan American World Airways, 
            reported he saw a blip Nov. 8 on a weather radar screen &quot;four 
            or five times larger than any aircraft observed in the past.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;It appeared at approximately 65 miles south-southwest of 
            Miami at an altitude of between 7,000 and 8,000 feet. It disappeared 
            and reappeared several times.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;It disappeared once at 70 miles and reappeared at about 
            55 miles, then moved back to 70 miles. The speed was estimated at 
            550 to 650 miles an hour.&quot;</p>
            <p>Freestone, who explained he had always been skeptical of flying 
            saucer reporst, said the object remained stationary at one point 
            for two or three minutes, then moved off in the south-southwest 
            direction it had come from.</p>
