   The year 1977 was a psychically active and exciting one for me. My 
   long time friend and I were exploring astral projection with great 
   success and reincarnation. I also got a job for a while with Mental 
   Health. On my own time, I was teaching self-hypnosis classes in 
   another city.
  </P>
  <P>
   The first self-hypnosis class was devoted to subconscious 
   communication with the pendulum. I had found this to be a very 
   powerful tool. The people who took the classes were from my different 
   beliefs, mostly traditional. A demonstration for shock value that I 
   always used after the subconscious communication pendulum motions had 
   been programmed in was to have everyone repeat the question, 
   &quot;Have I lived before?&quot;
  </P>
  <P>
   The answer was ALWAYS yes in the several months of classes that I 
   taught. Distressing to some, exciting to others. But it always 
   demonstrated the point that the subconscious will talk about things 
   even if the consciousness doesn't believe. It was a good way to get 
   people more focused on the power of the subconscious.
  </P>
  <P>
   During this time period, I also conducted some private hypnosis 
   sessions on a limited basis; I used automatic writing to get 
   information about the clients to help them. The sessions were always 
   fascinating but on several occasions with a couple of different 
   clients, they had the need to relay a message from the spirit world 
   about a mission that I was suppose to be on. I didn't think too much 
   about it. It was too general and not very impressive. At the time, I 
   just categorized it with the basic beliefs of the particular clients.
  </P>
  <P>
   However, before the year was over there were a couple of other 
   significant events that took place.
  </P>
  <P>
   One was a powerful astral projection experience. As I've mentioned, 
   my friend and I had been actively working to have conscious astral 
   projection experiences and had significant success. There were also 
   partial successes where the consciousness was somewhat active when 
   the process began but then faded out. I had become quite use to these 
   partials; the sensations, even after all these years are exciting.
  </P>
  <P>
   When the process would begin, I would be asleep but awake. My feet 
   would begin to move; however, it was not my physical feet. When I 
   became aware of this process, I would work to control my excitement 
   as emotion disrupts astral projection. I would next start mentally 
   directing my astral feet and legs up in the air working to break the 
   resistance that was in the solar plexus area. Most of the time, I 
   would either lose consciousness or the astral would reconnect to the 
   physical. However, one night in 1977, the process again worked and it 
   was a very powerful experience.
  </P>
  <P>
   The astral detachment had started and my consciousness turned on. 
   &quot;Oh boy!&quot; I thought to myself. I began vigorously throwing 
   my astral legs up in the air. Breaking the resistance was very hard 
   but I was determined to get out. For some reason, the consciousness 
   was very strong and clear.
  </P>
  <P>
   I was astrally kicking. Pulling my astral legs with my knees towards 
   my chest and then explosively extending them out. And....out I was.
  </P>
  <P>
   I was floating a couple of feet above my body. I could see 
   everything; 360 degree perception. In addition, I could see the walls 
   and through the walls and ceiling at the same time. I resisted the 
   urge to look at my body because I was too close and didn't want to 
   get pulled back in.
  </P>
  <P>
   I was out but another part of me was driving so to speak. My normal 
   consciousness was just along for the ride.
  </P>
  <P>
   I started upward literally. I went through the ceiling and through 
   the roof. I could feel myself passing through the materials and see 
   everything. I was thankful that I was in the top upstairs apartment 
   as I would have been moving through someone else's bedroom otherwise.
  </P>
  <P>
   The outside had that gray, twilight color to it. As I moved up, I 
   could see the surrounding area. This was not unusual as I had 
   experienced being outside astrally before. However, I started moving 
   straight up at a very fast pace.
  </P>
  <P>
   This was strange because in the past when I went straight up, I seem 
   to enter another dimension. This time, I was in SPACE! I was 
   traveling very fast and could see the stars and the planets of the 
   solar system beyond Earth. My conscious self was wondering what was 
   going on.
  </P>
  <P>
   This travel continued for an undetermined amount of time. THEN I 
   changed dimensions. It didn't happen close to the Earth like past 
   experiences, it happened way beyond Saturn.
  </P>
  <P>
   As the dimension changed, I found myself approaching a large, elegant 
   building. The building reminded me of an old, elegant library. I was 
   then at the large, ornately carved wooden door activating some sort 
   of knocking device.
  </P>
  <P>
   Shortly, a woman in a robe answered the door. My conscious self is 
   just along for the ride because some other part of me is driving. The 
   woman greets me with, &quot;We know who you are and we've been 
   expecting you.&quot; There was other dialog from her that I don't remember.
  </P>
  <P>
   I follow her into a large room with a podium. sitting on the floor on 
   pillows with their legs in the lotus position, are a bunch of 
   children. I'm led to the podium and the children are all watching me.
  </P>
  <P>
   My conscious self is thinking that I don't have a clue as to what I'm 
   suppose to do. But then, my consciousness switches off. When it comes 
   back on, I am still at the podium but now all the children are old 
   people in white robes. Apparently, whatever I had arrived to do was completed.
  </P>
  <P>
   The woman escorted me to the door and the trip there repeated itself 
   in reverse.
  </P>
  <P>
   During the entire flight back, I kept thinking to myself that I had 
   to remember this experience. I didn't know what it meant but I had to 
   remember it.
  </P>
  <P>
   When I entered the normal dimension in space, I was really moving; 
   much faster than the out trip as I was in a hurry to get back to my 
   body. I was heading straight for it.
  </P>
  <P>
   As I approached, I didn't slow down. I dived through the roof and 
   into my body. The force made my body bounce on the bed. But it 
   worked. I NEVER lost consciousness on the return. I jumped in my body 
   and opened my eyes continuing to see what I astrally saw. And I 
   remembered the entire experience.
  </P>
  <P>
   I didn't understand what the experience meant; I still don't. But I 
   did remember it.
  </P>
