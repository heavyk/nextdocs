The greatest computer in the world resides within YOUR mind with the 
   answers to everything that will ever concern you already programmed. 
   This is the Subconscious. However, if you don't ask, the Subconscious 
   will not answer. The Subconscious is your very own computer 
   programmed specifically for you but if you never input the question, 
   you will never get the answer that you need.
  </P>
  <P>
   The following work presents a method of Subconscious communication. 
   It shows you how to get your Subconscious to convey answers to your 
   needs from its vast storehouse of information and analytical 
   processes. It can work for you as it has for me. You should expect it 
   to for it is the heritage of the 21st century man. The utilization of 
   the Subconscious Mind is the faculty that will mark the distinction 
   between fearful, uncertain humanity of the present and a humanity 
   with purpose, progress, and peace.

   <font size="4">INTRODUCTION</font>
  </P>
  <P>
   The Subconscious, or inner mind, is one of the most amazing but least 
   understood portions of each individual's psyche. it has been both 
   denounced and praised for almost 100 years but until recently, never 
   utilized. NOW the situation appears to be changing. Both professional 
   psychotherapist and layman alike are beginning to explore the vast 
   resources and capabilities of this enigmatic entity. Although the 
   results of this research covers a wide and divergent spectrum, one 
   fact stands out, if one opens up a communication channel with the 
   Subconscious and develops that channel, one has access to the most 
   sophisticated computer in existence. The potential for the use of the 
   vast Subconscious resources appears to be limited only by ones imagination.
  </P>
  <P>
   By starting communication with your Subconscious, you have 
   potentially at your command every event, both physical and 
   psychological, that has ever occurred to you. Your Subconscious can 
   analyze data and solve problems for you, help you make important 
   decisions, give you accurate interpretations to tell you what your 
   dreams really mean, tell you why you are ill, tell you why you fear 
   something or feel negative and depressed, and many other services too 
   numerous to mention.
  </P>
  <P>
   Communication with your Subconscious allows you to expand your 
   Conscious far beyond the boundaries that you have operated within all 
   of your life. The following paper will deal with one form of 
   Subconscious communication.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <font size="4">MEET YOUR HIDDEN SELF: THE SUBCONSCIOUS</font>
  </P>
  <P>
   All of your life you have probably been operating with only 15 to 24 
   percent of your Total Mind. This seemingly widespread notion led some 
   theorists a number of years ago to hypothesize that most people 
   utilized only 10 to 15 percent of their brain. However, modern 
   thinking on the subject suggests that specific portions of the brain 
   have little to do with this thing that we call consciousness.
  </P>
  <P>
   It has been estimated by this author that approximately 76 percent of 
   the Total Mind consists of what is classified as the Subconscious --- 
   that which is not readily available to consciousness. According to 
   this model, the Total Mind also consists of a Conscious and a 
   Preconscious. The Conscious, which consists of approximately 16 
   percent of the Total Mind, is the part of the Mind with which we 
   think and perceive. It can be thought of in terms of attention. The 
   Preconscious, which consists of approximately eight percent of the 
   Total Mind, serves as the intermediary between the Conscious and the 
   Subconscious. This model of the Total Mind is presented in Figure 1.
  </P>

  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   Figure 1. Representation of the Total Mind
  </P>
  <P>
   It must be realized that this is a general estimate because some 
   people have greater Conscious access to the Subconscious than others.
  </P>
  <P>
   In general, we rarely think about the Subconscious. Almost the adage, 
   out of sight, out of mind. But the Subconscious does exist and it 
   continuously monitors the functions of the body and Conscious. 
   However, it only does the minimal necessary to maintain a functioning 
   organism. If you don't ask for more, it won't give it to you.
  </P>
  <P>
   In its effort to maintain minimal functioning of the system, the 
   Subconscious will try to come to our Conscious' assistance in times 
   of trouble with a flash of insight into our problems. It uses dreams 
   a great deal to convey this information. But usually, it sits back 
   and watches the progress of the Conscious. The Subconscious is like 
   the wise sage on the mountain top. It will answer questions if you 
   come to it and ask but usually won't seek you out. However, sometimes 
   the sage foresees disaster and leaves the mountain in an attempt to 
   warn. He is never sure if his warning will be heeded but he makes the attempt.
  </P>
  <P>
   So the question arises as to the nature of this stranger that watches 
   us, keeps us functioning, and attempts to help us when functioning is 
   threatened. This researcher has determined that the Subconscious has 
   three major areas of function in the total psyche: Storage, 
   Maintenance of the Autonomic Nervous System, and Analysis. Each of 
   these functions has ramifications far beyond those that the Conscious 
   has ever contemplated.
  </P>
  <P>
   The storage section of the Subconscious is the one with which most 
   individuals are familiar. It is what is commonly referred to as 
   memory. However, the storage facilities of the Subconscious far 
   exceed the standard level of Conscious memory. Every event, and 
   everything related to that event is stored in the Subconscious. For 
   example, a person with a clear, developed channel to his Subconscious 
   in recalling an event may remember such details as everything that 
   was said, who was there and who said what, what the event involved, 
   the temperature, the emotion and feelings expressed, the odors, the 
   various noises, small details of the event and scene involved, and an 
   analysis of the impact of the event on his physical and psychological 
   functioning. It doesn't matter whether this event took place two 
   minutes or thirty years ago, the data is there and theoretically 
   available for recall. Consequently, establishment of a Subconscious 
   communication channel can expand Conscious memory.
  </P>
  <P>
   The second major function of the Subconscious is maintenance of the 
   Autonomic Nervous System. The Autonomic Nervous System is in charge 
   of such functions as heart rate, body temperature, muscle tone, blood 
   pressure, focusing of the eyes, unconscious motor movements, 
   generation of chemicals and antibodies to fight disease, and every 
   type of body maintenance that is necessary for life but which we do 
   not consciously think about. As you can see, the Subconscious 
   literally maintains life itself. By opening a channel of 
   communication, it is possible to bring some of these Autonomic 
   Nervous System functions under Conscious control. For example, high 
   blood pressure is a destructive disease which affects many people in 
   our society. There are several medical reasons for this disease but 
   no matter what the cause, the end result is usually destruction of 
   vital organs such as the liver, kidneys, and brain. There are 
   medications that control high blood pressure in most people but in 
   some cases nothing seems to work. In such cases, it would probably be 
   useful for the individual to communicate with his Subconscious to 
   find out why the situation exists and why the medication is 
   ineffective. With this information, the individual can begin to 
   correct the external problems related to the high blood pressure and 
   the Subconscious can be directed to begin correction of the internal 
   problems so that the medication can be effective. The Subconscious 
   has the ability to do this via the Autonomic Nervous System.
  </P>
  <P>
   Another example of utilizing the Subconscious regulation of the 
   Autonomic Nervous System concerns an area that affects almost 
   everyone in American society. This is high pressure living which 
   results in stress. Research seems to suggest that stress results in 
   such bodily problems as migraine headaches, anxiety, stomach cramps, 
   ulcers, constipation, and a wide variety of other physical changes 
   that, if allowed to continue for a long period of time, will damage 
   the body permanently. It has been found that many of the stress 
   related problems are accompanied by muscular tension some of the 
   negative effects of stress. Reduction of muscle tenseness can be 
   accomplished by dealing with the Subconscious which controls muscle 
   tone. As one can see from the examples, by opening a communication 
   channel and consciously dealing with the Subconscious, it is possible 
   to reduce or remove detrimental body conditions by use of the 
   Autonomic Nervous System.
  </P>
  <P>
   The third function of the Subconscious, Analysis, is the one least 
   known about in modern society even though many ancient and primitive 
   cultures utilized it. It appears that the Subconscious thinks and 
   reasons independently of the Conscious. In doing so, the Subconscious 
   weighs all the data available to it and based on its analyses, draws 
   conclusions. In many cases, due to the greater knowledge base which 
   the Subconscious possesses, the conclusions are usually much 
   different and more accurate than that of the Conscious. If you 
   communicated with your Subconscious, the analytical portion could 
   help you make better Conscious decisions.
  </P>
  <P>
   In this authors opinion, it is the Analytical portion of the 
   Subconscious that monitors the integrity of the organism and attempts 
   to help the Conscious in times of trouble. If the communication 
   channel was open, it would be easier to solve the more serious 
   problems in your life. In general, establishing communication with 
   the Subconscious in order to consciously use the vast analytical and 
   memory resources found there could expand your Conscious capabilities 
   far beyond those that you have ever imagined.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <font size="4">VALUES OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE SUBCONSCIOUS</font>
  </P>
  <P>
   Any type of communication with the Subconscious is valuable because 
   even the smallest amount has the tendency to enrich and expand normal 
   Conscious function. But there are specific examples of how people can 
   use the three different functions of the Subconscious.
  </P>
  <P>
   This author has personally used the analytical function of the 
   Subconscious in decision making. There have been times when I have 
   had to decide if I should attend a particular meeting or give a 
   lecture to a particular group. For the most part, I have been 
   hesitant to make the commitment for various reasons. In many cases, 
   my Subconscious has surprisingly stated that I should make a 
   commitment. Invariably, my Subconscious has been correct because all 
   have had something valuable to offer to me. I have learned to rely a 
   great deal on the analytical function of my Subconscious for all 
   sorts of decisions. Its greater access to information expands my 
   Conscious analytical ability.
  </P>
  <P>
   Some uses of the Subconscious storage bank can lead to peace of mind. 
   For instance, how many times have you left on a trip, got a number of 
   miles away from home and thought, &quot;Did I lock the door ? &quot; 
   or &quot;Did I turn off the stove ? &quot; In such a case, we either 
   go back and check, which results in aggravation when we learn we did 
   lock the door and delayed our trip for nothing or we worry about it 
   all the time we are gone. With Subconscious communication, your 
   Subconscious can tell you whether you did or didn't do something and 
   you can return home and correct it or proceed on your trip with 
   freedom from worry.
  </P>
  <P>
   Another use of the Subconscious is valuable to expecting parents. 
   This is asking the Subconscious to predict the sex of the unborn 
   child. As has been mentioned in an earlier section, the Subconscious 
   has the capability to monitor all body functions which includes the 
   reproductive organs. Consequently, it is not unreasonable to assume 
   that the Subconscious of the pregnant woman knows the sex of the 
   child that is forming within her.
  </P>
  <P>
   Along a similar line, the Subconscious probably knows the source and 
   nature of any illness that you may be experiencing. it knows whether 
   or not the illness is purely organic and physical or if it has 
   psychological roots. Psychological illnesses can be just as damaging 
   to the body as organic ones. Usually illness is a combination of both.
  </P>
  <P>
   With its monitoring of the body, it is reasonable to assume that the 
   Subconscious knows what organ or part of the body is affected and the 
   reasons why. For example, a client came to me with a severe stomach 
   ailment. It was serious enough that the individual had been to the 
   doctor and had gone through a complete series of Gastro - Intestinal 
   tests. At this point let me state that as a psychotherapist, I do not 
   deal with a person with a physical ailment until that individual has 
   had a complete physical checkup by a physician. The purpose of this 
   procedure is to protect both the client and myself.
  </P>
  <P>
   After the extensive series of tests, the doctor told the individual 
   that there was nothing organically wrong. But even with this 
   assurance, the problem did not go away and continued to be quite 
   painful. The individual, afraid that it might be cancer, was 
   preparing to return to the doctor for the uncomfortable tests when he 
   came to see me. I immediately established a communication channel 
   with this individual's Subconscious. Upon questioning the 
   Subconscious, it was revealed that far into the individual's past, an 
   incident had occurred that had involved stomach damage. This physical 
   damage had healed long ago but in the immediate past, some event had 
   occurred that had prompted a portion of the individual's Mind to 
   recall this damage and it was manipulating the Autonomic Nervous 
   System in a symbolic representation of the stomach damage. In other 
   words, the real pain and suffering was there but the actual damage 
   was not. When the individual's Conscious learned of the origin of his 
   problem, the pain went away and has not returned in over two years. 
   As you can see, the Subconscious can find and resolve health 
   problems. Let me again point out that although the Subconscious can 
   aid the healing process, it must not be used as a substitute for your physician.
  </P>
  <P>
   Although there are a multitude of uses for Subconscious 
   communication, space here does not permit a complete analysis. 
   Basically, you will find many uses as you become familiar with the 
   communication process. However, a final use to be mentioned lies in 
   the area of dream interpretation. Even a professional psychotherapist 
   is not always sure of the meaning of his client's dreams. He may 
   notice patterns but the language of the particular client's 
   Subconscious may be difficult to interpret. The easiest way to find 
   out the actual meaning of the dream is by questioning the 
   Subconscious directly. In most of the cases, dreams are an attempt by 
   the analytical portion of the Subconscious to make contact with and 
   give information to the Conscious. Usually this information is of 
   great value to the Conscious but it may have difficulty understanding 
   what the Subconscious was trying to say. Communication allows the 
   Conscious to find out what the Subconscious wanted it to know.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <font size="4">HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE SUBCONSCIOUS</font>
  </P>
  <P>
   The first step in utilizing the vast resources of the Subconscious is 
   to establish a communication channel. In the beginning, it may be 
   difficult to differentiate between the various portions of the Mind 
   by hearing them in your head although with practice you may be able 
   to do so. Thus, it is necessary to create a more obvious, if not more 
   simplistic form of communication. One easy way of doing this is to 
   set up a code of communication by means of physical signals 
   controlled by the Subconscious. This is possible because, as 
   mentioned earlier in another section, the Subconscious is in charge 
   of the Autonomic Nervous System which controls, among other things, 
   the involuntary muscles. Since it controls involuntary muscles, the 
   Subconscious can learn to control voluntary muscles. Some of the 
   first muscles the Subconscious can easily learn to use are arm and 
   hand muscles.
  </P>
  <P>
   Using the notion of muscle movement for Subconscious communication, 
   an indicator is selected to represent this movement, a YES-NO code 
   established, and questions worded so that the Subconscious can 
   respond utilizing the YES-NO code. At first, the movements by the 
   Subconscious are slight and a sensitive measuring device is needed. 
   It has been found that one of the most sensitive indicators consists 
   of nothing more than a pendulum. The pendulum is easily constructed 
   from materials found around the home. Any small, light object such as 
   a paper clip or an iron washer for the weight and a piece of thread 
   eight or so inches long completes the measuring device.
  </P>
  <P>
   The pendulum method is by far the easiest and fastest way of 
   establishing communication with the Subconscious portions of the Mind 
   and in my practice as a psychotherapist, I routinely teach it to 
   clients as the first basic step of the treatment process.
  </P>
  <P>
   In using the pendulum, you should hold the thread between the thumb 
   and forefinger of the hand with which you write and allow your elbow 
   to rest on a desk or table so that the weight dangles freely (See 
   Figure 2).
  </P>
  <P align="center">
   <IMG SRC="38f6bbf8.jpg" ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=327 HEIGHT=202 VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0 BORDER=0>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   Figure 2. Diagram of Proper Pendulum Position
  </P>
  <P>
   The weight portion of the pendulum should be approximately one to two 
   inches above the surface of the table. You should hold the END of the 
   thread between your thumb and forefinger. Trim the length of thread 
   so that this is the case. You should allow your hand and arm to be as 
   relaxed as possible and your body should be in a comfortable sitting position.
  </P>
  <P>
   There are a multitude of ways that the pendulum can swing but there 
   are only four cardinal movements. As Figure 3 shows,
  </P>
  <P align="center">
   <IMG SRC="38f6bbf9.jpg" ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=287 HEIGHT=272 VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0 BORDER=0>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   Figure 3. Cardinal Movements of the Pendulum
  </P>
  <P>
   it can move: 1. Back and forth across in front of you, 2. In and out 
   away from you, 3. Clockwise circle, and 4. Counter-clockwise circle.
  </P>
  <P>
   It is best to let the Subconscious select its own movements for the 
   code. This opens up the spirit of communication and cooperation 
   between the Conscious and Subconscious. It also reduces Conscious 
   interference and indicates to the Conscious that the Subconscious 
   does think and reason. The Subconscious will select a movement for 
   YES, one for NO, another for MAYBE, and the final movement for I 
   DON'T WANT TO ANSWER.
  </P>
  <P>
   Now it is time to start the communication process. Holding the 
   pendulum between the thumb and forefinger, voluntarily swing it in 
   each of the four directions. Move it as distinctly as possible 
   because you are teaching your Subconscious how to move those 
   particular muscles and locking in the movement pattern into the 
   Subconscious' storage banks. To make certain that the movements are 
   properly stored, swing the pendulum long enough to mentally count to 
   15 for each direction. After this has been done, stop the pendulum 
   and do not consciously move it from this point on.
  </P>
  <P>
   With the pendulum in the still position, mentally say the following, 
   &quot;Subconscious, select one of the four movements to signify 
   YES.&quot; Then repeat mentally over and over, &quot;Swing for 
   YES.&quot; Usually the pendulum will start to move within a few 
   seconds but it may take a few moments to start operation. Each time 
   you mentally repeat the phrase, &quot;Swing for YES.&quot;, the 
   pendulum will begin to move a little more as if it were building up 
   energy. Even though it may look like it is standing still, it is 
   making slight movements that are not yet perceptible. Keep repeating 
   the phrase until you have a discernible movement of the pendulum. it 
   is necessary to watch the pendulum because the Subconscious depends 
   on visual feedback to determine how accurately it is reproducing the 
   movements that correspond to answers it wishes to give.
  </P>
  <P>
   Try to hold the pendulum still but don't prevent it from moving. 
   There will be slight movements of the hand which are perfectly 
   normal. These slight muscle movements are how the Subconscious 
   translates the questions into answers.
  </P>
  <P>
   It is important that you write down the code so that you will 
   consciously be aware of it. You may want to do it in the following 
   manner. Make yourself a chart as in Figure 4, then with each subsequent
  </P>
  <P>

  </P>
  <P>
   selection, write down the symbol for the movement. When the YES 
   response has been selected, write down its symbol.
  </P>
  <P>
   It is now time to select the NO response. Make certain that the 
   pendulum is in the still position. If it is not, you may consciously 
   use your free hand to stop it. Then say, &quot;Subconscious, select 
   one of the three remaining movements to represent NO.&quot; Now begin 
   to repeat mentally over and over without pause, &quot;Swing for 
   NO.&quot; Shortly, the Subconscious will begin to move the pendulum 
   in a new direction. As you repeat the request for the NO symbol, the 
   movement of the pendulum will get stronger and stronger. When a 
   clearly identifiable response has been achieved, write down on your 
   chart the symbol that represents the NO response.
  </P>
  <P>
   The next response that you need to code is MAYBE. The MAYBE response 
   is a useful tool for the Subconscious as it allows it to tell you 
   that your question was worded in such a way that some of it is true 
   and some of it is false. If the Subconscious answered such a question 
   either one way or the other, it would be giving incorrect 
   information. If you get a MAYBE response, it indicates that you need 
   to reword your question.
  </P>
  <P>
   To code MAYBE, you need to start your pendulum from the still 
   position. While watching it intently, say mentally, 
   &quot;Subconscious, select one of the remaining swings to signify 
   MAYBE.&quot; Then begin to repeat mentally over and over without 
   pause, &quot;Swing for MAYBE.&quot; The pendulum will soon begin to 
   swing in a new direction and the movement will become stronger and 
   stronger. When it is clear what the movement is, write it down on 
   your chart.
  </P>
  <P>
   Now it is time to allow the Subconscious to swing in the final 
   direction for I DON'T WANT TO ANSWER. The purpose of this answer is 
   to indicate if there are blocks preventing information from flowing 
   out of the Subconscious storage banks. Technically, blocks are called 
   Defense Mechanisms. They are what psychotherapists spend most of 
   their time removing. Subconscious communication is one of the easiest 
   ways to get around Defense Mechanisms. Start the pendulum from a 
   still position. Gaze at it steadily and say in your mind, 
   &quot;Subconscious, select a movement for I DON'T WANT TO 
   ANSWER.&quot; Then begin to repeat mentally over and over, &quot;Swing
    for I DON'T WANT TO ANSWER.&quot; It is unnecessary for you to 
   consciously remember the movement that is left because your 
   Subconscious will do that for you. As you repeat the request, the 
   pendulum will begin to move in the final direction and the movement 
   will become stronger and stronger. Write it down and you have 
   completed the communication code that will be the same for the rest 
   of your life.
  </P>
  <P>
   In my experience as a psychotherapist, I have found that the pendulum 
   method of communication works with almost everyone. In cases where 
   there was initial difficulty, it was later revealed that there was 
   internal mental conflict that resulted in the individual seeking 
   treatment. When the conflict was resolved and the client improved, 
   the pendulum method began to operate more effectively. So if the 
   pendulum method does not work satisfactorily for you, there is some 
   problem that is blocking off the flow from your Subconscious that 
   needs to be discovered and removed.

   <font size="4">THE PROPER WAY TO QUESTION THE SUBCONSCIOUS</font>
  </P>
  <P>
   In preparing questions for the Subconscious, it is important that 
   they say exactly what you mean. The easiest way to accomplish this is 
   to keep it simple. Remember, complex ideas can be conveyed by 
   breaking them down into the more simple components. In order to help 
   you make certain, it is best that you write out the questions you 
   wish to ask. This allows you to easily see that they are properly 
   worded. Also, this allows you to note the answers so that you can 
   consciously direct the line of questioning based on the information 
   that you learn.
  </P>
  <P>
   In questioning the Subconscious, you start out with general questions 
   and get more specific. The following example will give you some idea 
   as to how you would gather information from your Subconscious about 
   an important topic.
  </P>
  <P>
   A client came to me with a frustrating problem, a severe case of 
   finger nail biting for which he had tried everything to stop 
   including such extreme measures as vile tasting liquid on the nails 
   and having someone slap him on the hands when he bit them. However, 
   nothing seemed to work and his nails were always in the quick. He 
   told me that the problem had existed for as long as he could remember 
   and was extremely embarrassing to him. This type of problem is not uncommon.
  </P>
  <P>
   The first step in the treatment process was to teach this individual 
   how to use the pendulum utilizing the same procedures that you have 
   already completed. After this had been done and his Subconscious 
   communication code established, it was time to trace out the roots of 
   this problem by questioning his Subconscious. The questioning 
   proceeded as follows:
  </P>
  <P>
   1.Subconscious, will you talk about the origin of the finger nail 
   biting ? YES.
  </P>
  <P>
   2.Did the nail biting start at or before the age of five ? NO.
  </P>
  <UL>
  <P>
   1.Did it start before ten ? YES.
  </P>
  <P>
   2.Did it start before seven ? YES.
  </P>
  <P>
   3.Did it start at Six ? YES. (This answer tells us when the actual 
   nail biting started which the client could not consciously remember. 
   Also note that this is the proper procedure to use to get ages, 
   dates, or any other types of numbers from the Subconscious.)
  </P>
  </UL>
  <P>
   3. At the age of six, was a relative involved in the start of the 
   nail biting ? NO.
  </P>
  <UL>
  <P>
   1. Was a friend involved ? NO.
  </P>
  <P>
   2. Was a stranger involved ? YES. (At this point, the client could 
   not consciously remember who the Subconscious was referring to.
  </P>
  </UL>
  <P>
   4. Did the incident that started the nail biting occur at home ? NO.
  </P>
  <UL>
  <P>
   Did it occur at school ? YES.
  </P>
  </UL>
  <P>
   5. Was the person involved in the start of the nail biting a student 
   ? NO.
  </P>
  <UL>
  <P>
   Was it the teacher ? YES. (The client informed me that his first 
   grade teacher was &quot;mean&quot;.)
  </P>
  </UL>
  <P>
   6. Are there any other causes of the nail biting ? YES.
  </P>
  <P>
   7. Does the other source of the nail biting start at an earlier age ? YES.
  </P>
  <UL>
  <P>
   1.Does it start before the age of three ? YES.
  </P>
  <P>
   2.Does it start before one ? YES.
  </P>
  <P>
   3.Does it start before six months ? YES.
  </P>
  <P>
   4.Does it start before three months ? YES.
  </P>
  <P>
   5.Does it start before one month ? No.
  </P>
  <P>
   6.Does it start at two months ? YES. (Even though this was logically 
   deducible, it is good practice to check everything with the 
   Subconscious. This answer told us when the real problem started that 
   resulted in the symptom of finger nail biting.)
  </P>
  <P>
   8.Subconscious, I want this information related to the age of two 
   months. Does the problem involve a relative ? YES.
  </P>
  <P>
   1. Does it involve the Father ? NO.
  </P>
  <P>
   2. Does it involve the Mother ? YES.
  </P>
  </UL>
  <P>
   9.Was the problem related to something that the Mother did ? YES.
  </P>
  <UL>
  <P>
   1. Was it something physical ? NO.
  </P>
  <P>
   2. Was it something psychological ? YES.
  </P>
  </UL>
  <P>
   At this point as a psychotherapist, I had all the information that I 
   needed to begin treating the client. I knew the symptoms began at the 
   age of six years when the client was in the first grade and that it 
   involved his teacher. I also knew that the real roots of the problem 
   extended to two months of age and involved something that the Mother 
   was doing that had a negative psychological impact on the child.
  </P>
  <P>
   All of this valid information which delineated the problem and its 
   sources was derived in about 15 minutes. Standard psychotherapy would 
   have taken at least four or five expensive sessions to determine the 
   actual problem and the therapist would still not have known the 
   sources because the individual did not consciously remember them.
  </P>
  <P>
   Utilizing information from the Subconscious and other techniques, the 
   following tale emerged: The client's Mother had to work because 
   family finances were not sufficient. Consequently, the child was 
   taken to the grandmother's every working day starting at about the 
   age of two months. Unfortunately, the grandmother resented keeping 
   the child and deliberately let him know it. This situation led the 
   child's Mind to assume that he was worthless and didn't deserve love 
   because if his Mother had loved him, she would not have left the 
   child every day with someone who was mean to him. This feeling of 
   unworthiness led to a basic insecurity which was accentuated in the 
   first grade by a cruel teacher. A manifestation of this insecurity 
   and feeling of worthlessness was nail biting. With the client's 
   Conscious aware of this information, the nail biting was stopped in 
   about ninety minutes of treatment.
  </P>
  <P>
   As you can see, even though the pendulum is very simplistic, a wealth 
   of information can be recovered from the Subconscious with proper questioning.
  </P>

  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <font size="4">COMMUNICATION: THE PRECONSCIOUS</font> <font size="4">OR ANTI-SELF</font>
  </P>
  <P>
   One problem that people eventually run into in communicating with 
   their Subconscious is false information. Most people will get an I 
   DON'T WANT TO ANSWER response rather than false information but 
   eventually the latter will come out. one of the first things to do if 
   you feel you've gotten a wrong answer is to reword your question. It 
   is possible that your questions had more than one meaning and that 
   your Subconscious correctly responded to an alternate interpretation.
  </P>
  <P>
   However, even after rewording your questions, and with all other 
   precautions taken, you may still get false information. At this point 
   it is necessary to talk about another portion of the mind that is 
   below the Conscious level but not a part of the Subconscious. This is 
   the Preconscious. As a professional psychotherapist, I have found 
   that whenever incorrect information, distorted information, or no 
   information is received, the Preconscious is usually responsible.
  </P>
  <P>
   The overall purpose of the Preconscious is an important one. The 
   major function of this portion of the mind seems to be one of 
   translation of the languages of the Subconscious and Conscious.
  </P>
  <P>
   The Subconscious appears to function in different terms from the 
   Conscious. In general, it appears to operate in symbols that are 
   highly meaningful to it but not so meaningful to consciousness. If 
   you want a good example of this, just recall the last vivid dream 
   that you had. This dream was your Subconscious trying to give you 
   some important information and yet, if you are like most people, the 
   dream had many elements that seemed strange and didn't make any 
   sense. It is almost like a foreign language. The dream was not 
   interpreted because the Preconscious translator was not functioning. 
   Hence, the meaning of the dream was not clear to the Conscious.
  </P>
  <P>
   Even with a properly functioning Preconscious, much of the 
   Subconscious intent is lost in translation. However, with a malicious 
   Preconscious, not only is information lost, but inaccurate and 
   distorted information substituted. When this problem occurs, it is 
   time to deal with the Preconscious. In order to do this effectively, 
   one needs to know more about its characteristics.
  </P>
  <P>
   One reason for the Preconscious' ability to block information is its 
   location. As Figure 5 shows, the Preconscious occupies a very 
   strategic location and can control what comes out of the Subconscious.
  </P>
  <P>
   Part of the problem with the Preconscious seems to be its level of 
   development. it simply does not seem to keep up with the other parts 
   of the Mind. The language of Transactional Analysis seems to suggest this
  </P>

   Figure 5. Position of the Preconscious
  </P>
  <P>
   notion.In this terminology, the Mind is divided into the parent, 
   adult, and child. This corresponds to the Subconscious, Conscious, 
   and Preconscious respectively and in this framework, the Subconscious'
  </P>
  <P>
   child, the Preconscious, knows a foreign language --- the language of 
   the Conscious. Through the child, the parent can communicate with an 
   adult friend, the Conscious, who speaks a different language. 
   Utilizing this analogy, here is what might be going on between the 
   different parts of
  </P>
  <P>
   the Mindin an individual whose Preconscious is doing damage to the 
   Conscious. Remember, this is only one possible situation out of an 
   infinite number of probabilities.
  </P>
  <P>
   The malicious Preconscious may be like the child who is threatened by 
   the vast knowledge, resources, and accomplishments of the parent. 
   This usually leads to jealousy and although the child wants to harm 
   the parent, he is hesitant to do so because he fears the great power 
   and ability it possesses. Thus, this jealousy can manifest in many 
   different forms. This author has found one pattern that seems to show 
   up a great deal. This pattern is where the jealous Preconscious plots 
   against the Conscious in order to indirectly get back at the 
   Subconscious. Essentially, it is trying to create disharmony between 
   the various portions of the Mind which results in mental conflict. 
   This of course makes the Subconscious uncomfortable because it 
   strives to create balance.
  </P>
  <P>
   One of the Preconscious' favorite tricks to create this disharmony is 
   to gather negative information on the Conscious and present it to the 
   Subconscious. It is almost like the Preconscious keeps a negative 
   file on the Conscious and uses this information in an attempt to 
   program the Subconscious to do various negative things against the 
   Conscious from headaches to heart problems. Remember it can do this 
   because the Preconscious is the intermediary that translates between 
   the Conscious and Subconscious. All it has to do is slyly 
   misinterpret some choice events over a period of time to give the 
   Subconscious a negative opinion of the Conscious. I have dealt with a 
   number of clients whose Subconscious' were disappointed, although 
   incorrectly so, with their Conscious. Consequently, they sometimes 
   feel the need to punish but since all parts of the Mind are joined, 
   they all suffer. This is an unhealthy situation that sometimes 
   requires professional help.
  </P>
  <P>
   If you have trouble getting the pendulum to work for you, it may mean 
   that your Preconscious is trying to harm you. It is important that 
   you find out for what reasons.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <font size="4">SUMMARY</font>
  </P>
  <P>
   Exploration of the Subconscious is a necessary step to understanding 
   and expanding the Conscious. Enriching and expanding the environment 
   in which<I> we </I>live is the result of such an exploration. With 
   the greater knowledge and analytical resources gained from your 
   Subconscious, you can solve your problems and develop mental powers 
   that you never thought possible.
