   I've had a few paranormal experiences over the years. One that I 
   found rather interesting happened in late 1979 or early 1980.
  </P>
  <P>
   An acquaintance's father became ill and was in the hospital. I had 
   met the man a few times and knew what he looked like. Soon, I heard 
   that he had died.
  </P>
  <P>
   On the day that the funeral was to be held, I was sitting in my 
   living room when I suddenly smelled a strong smell of dirt; like dirt 
   smells when it has been freshly dug up. I looked up and perceived 
   this man, the deceased father of my acquaintance, standing in my 
   living room.
  </P>
  <P>
   I could hear him in my mind. He was upset. There was something that 
   he wanted to tell his daughter that he didn't get a chance to. He 
   wanted me to help.
  </P>
  <P>
   I mentally told him I would do what I could and he disappeared along 
   with the smell of dirt.
  </P>
  <P>
   A few days later, I told his daughter that there was something that 
   her father wanted to tell her and that he had come to me for help.
  </P>
  <P>
   I went to her house to relay the message. I relaxed, focused on my 
   inner perception and shortly, her father was there. I was sitting on 
   the couch and he sat down on the floor cross-legged. I thought it 
   rather unusual that a ghost would sit down. Again, I could hear him 
   in my mind and repeated aloud what I heard him say to his daughter.
  </P>
  <P>
   As I finished the message, my friend began to cry. It seems that she 
   had not been present when he died but the other family members had 
   been. The message that I repeated was what her father had told the 
   other family members but she wasn't there at the time. I had no idea 
   that the father had told the family anything; I just repeated the 
   words that I heard in my mind.
  </P>
  <P>
   After the spirit of her father conveyed the message, he stood up and disappeared.
  </P>
  <P>
   This was the first time I've ever been actively recruited to convey a 
   message from the dead. It's only happened two other times over the 
   years but that was the first. It is clear to me that the person 
   doesn't cease to exist with death. Dying does not get you away from 
   yourself or your feelings. This makes life all the more precious 
   because, it is only in life that we can deal with issues. Simply 
   dying does not make the issues or our feelings go away.
