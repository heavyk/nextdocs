  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Greetings to you along the path. It is I, D.K. and 
   tonight we shall discuss the history of <B>mediumship</B>.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>A need for <B>mediumship</B> is a relatively new one for 
   humanity. It is one that developed after the time of Atlantis. In the 
   days of Atlantis, humanity and the physical were different than the 
   present. The vibrational pattern of the human spirit was such that 
   the people could easily slip from what you call the astral vehicle to 
   the physical. It was difficult for them to distinguish a difference. 
   People that exist like that in your culture are classified as insane, 
   but this is but a cultural definition. Their inability to deal with 
   the situation is the result of a lack of education.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Since the time of Atlantis, as humanity has matured, the 
   abilities of the spirit have been greatly repressed. A great deal of 
   this is the results of the black brotherhood. They have worked to 
   divorce humanity from the spirit; to fixate humanity in the mundane 
   concrete world as he knows it today.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>After the time of Atlantis the world energy pattern 
   shifted and went through its various phases; these cycles last 
   approximately two thousand one hundred years. Atlantis, of course, 
   was a seventh ray manifestation; the last two thousand one hundred 
   years of Atlantis was a seventh ray manifestation. After that point, 
   the cycle started over again moving from the first ray manifestation 
   in two thousand one hundred year cycles into the present.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As each energy manifested itself, mankind or humanity 
   matured. But the black brotherhood worked to entrench the spirit and 
   imprison matter. With each succeeding generation, the communion with 
   spirit ebbed away until finally in the last two thousand years the 
   bottom of the cycle was reached. The nature of the seventh ray is 
   such that the conditions of the Astral and Physical intertwine and 
   blend into the other.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And so as the sixth ray cycle drew to a close, the work 
   on the non-physical levels was oriented to firmly establishing the 
   connection between the physical and the spiritual. The purpose, of 
   course, is to bring knowledge back to a more mature humanity; to 
   bring back the lessons that were presented during the last seventh 
   ray manifestation to a more accepting audience.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In the days of Atlantis, the teachers used seventh ray 
   techniques in their presentations. Spirit and matter were 
   inconsequential; one was the other. It made no difference to the 
   humanity of the time. As this has been eroded away, the need became 
   great for many different breaches through the wall of dense matter. 
   And these breaches are the individual <B>mediums</B> or <B>channels</B>.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In preparation for the work numerous entities that have 
   the capacities for channeling have incarnated into the physical. They 
   have their non-physical counterparts making up a working team; the 
   physicalized channel and the non-physicals that serve to collect and 
   transmit the information.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This process was accelerated approximately one hundred 
   and fifty years ago. At the time people began to notice on a world 
   wide basis spiritual phenomena in greater numbers. Spiritual 
   phenomena has always existed, there has always been entities who, 
   through great risks to themselves, have carried forth the contact 
   with the spiritual planes, always keeping the light burning through 
   the darkness of the physical plane times.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>But the new trend was instituted in greater proportion 
   at this time. Numerous people, many whom were not prepared 
   consciously, began to experience the spiritual phenomena, to gear it 
   to the individual's level of development. At the time, it was of a 
   more physical nature. It started off physical in order to acclimate 
   the peoples' consciousnesses to the higher vibrations that would 
   ultimately be needed for the transmission of knowledge.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>You must remember at the time on the physical plane a 
   hundred and fifty years ago, the people were strongly affected by 
   their environment. It was a very hard existence for most people. 
   Survival was a prime motivation. Focus on the physical was directed 
   towards the survival. It took a great deal to get their attention; it 
   took something physical. And this phenomena was provided. A great 
   deal of energy was expended to produce the physical effects that have 
   been recorded in the literature of Spiritualism.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We also expended a great deal of energy to manifest 
   physical phenomena to the various groups with whom we communicated; 
   this was needed. It is what we have referred to as the first phase. 
   This phenomena lasted approximately a hundred years, with its peak 
   fifty years after the onset of phase one. At the fifty year level, 
   the second phase was instituted. This phase, on a world wide basis, 
   consisted of proving the continued existence of the spirit. A great 
   deal of energy was expended from the physical realms and the 
   spiritual realms to proving the continued existence of the soul.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>At the same time, groups such as ourselves on a smaller 
   scale began the transmission of knowledge that was suitable for the 
   level of development of the entities consciousnesses with whom we 
   were dealing at the time.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Part of the difficulty in the transmission of any 
   material is the culture or the cultural beliefs of the channels with 
   whom we are dealing. For example, a hundred years ago, which would be 
   approximately 1885, the conception of a human being standing on the 
   moon was unheard of. This could not have been discussed with any 
   understanding by the majority of the population. To a few with 
   abstract thinking this could be done, but even that was out of the 
   realm of experience. The knowledge that we worked to transmit at the 
   time was recorded and presented by the Theosophical Organization. 
   Unfortunately, they quickly fell victim as had other groups to 
   dogmatism and cutting off the evolution of new information. After the 
   original material was presented they did not accept the development 
   of new channels. This they viewed as a threat. Many of their members 
   that are incarnated in the physical today still have this prejudice 
   within their beings that must be removed.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It is not the nature of the PATH of spirituality to 
   stand in one spot. The PATH does not move, the <B>follower</B> of the 
   PATH moves. Knowledge grows. It is not presented and then stops. It 
   is a constant growing spiral. And so the majority of the energy was 
   directed to proving to the direst skeptic that the spirit, the 
   personality if you will, continues after the body dies.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Approximately fifty years ago this phase was 
   dramatically concluded and work began to prepare for phase three. 
   This has required a great deal of effort. It has taken a long time to 
   prepare new channels to be reflectors of the higher teachings. It 
   requires a dedication, unselfishness, a willingness to devote oneself 
   to the work and a desire to reflect the information, despite the 
   personal beliefs of the channel.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And now as the new seventh ray energy begins to beam 
   down upon the world, the winds of change are beginning to howl. At 
   the same time, at the subconscious level, humanity is expecting once 
   again to see the wall between the physical and the spirit dissolve. 
   It will require many transmitters of spiritual teachings spread upon 
   a wide front to help the individuals adjust to the new energy 
   pattern. At a subconscious level, they are ready for it. At a 
   conscious level many are confused.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Now we move into phase three, the transmission of higher 
   physical knowledge. Physical knowledge in the sense that for the 
   first time in history of humanity, an understanding of the nature of 
   their reality is possible.</FONT>
