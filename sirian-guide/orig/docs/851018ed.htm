   <FONT SIZE=3>Dear children and beloved colleagues, it is I, Kathumi. 
   I come to speak to you this evening concerning a topic that is of 
   interest to everyone on the path of spiritual development.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In the last transmission the nature, and results, of 
   fear was discussed. The summation of that transmission was that fear 
   served no useful purpose.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Tonight, we would like to continue the discussion of 
   &quot;pitfalls of personality&quot; that affects one at various 
   stages along the path of spiritual development. The qualities of 
   which I speak are &quot;pride and humility&quot;. Both pride and 
   humility have the same end result; the result is a failure to advance.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As the energy increases it amplifies portions of the 
   personality; portions related to past experiences; portions related 
   to body consciousness. This is most clearly reflected in the emotions.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As has been said many times in the past the greatest 
   obstacle to overcome on the physical plane; to overcome to advance to 
   higher spiritual levels; the greatest obstacle is emotion.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>So one would ask, &quot;How can pride and humility have 
   the same end result?&quot; Although seemingly contradictory they are 
   in fact complementary.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In the case of humility; one never tries. If one never 
   tries, one never accomplishes. In the case of pride, one feels that 
   they are better than others; that they do not have to work or make 
   the effort. Consequently they also do not make progress. In both 
   instances the beliefs delude the individual and hold them back. These 
   are two extremes.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As we have mentioned before, the middle path is the 
   hardest to travel, but the easiest for the long journey. The tendency 
   is to be distracted from one extreme to the other. Emotionalism is 
   what polarizes the traveler and pulls from one extreme to the other.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Since ancient times we have worked with mankind in an 
   attempt to foster self awareness; to make the individual face the 
   most difficult image that one will ever face on the physical plane; 
   and that is themselves.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The spiritual self is separate from the personality as 
   well as the body consciousness. This is why an individual can have 
   great conflict within themselves resulting in difficulties of health; 
   resulting in emotional difficulties. HARMONY is the key to continued 
   growth but for most, it is a difficult task to balance and walk the 
   middle path. The key to doing so resides in the past for you are the 
   sum total of everything that has ever occurred and you are also 
   responsible for your past. You cannot blame others for things that 
   have happened to you for once the act is committed it is gone. If the 
   results of the act continue then it is due to factors within yourself 
   and thus is your responsibility. If another affects you, if another 
   causes a reaction within you, it is something that you must look 
   into. It is something that you must explore. And this is an important 
   lesson to learn on the path of spiritual development.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Interpersonal relationships are a dynamic element of the 
   physical plane. People are constantly chaining themselves to others 
   unnecessarily. Over time we will work to offer procedures, techniques 
   for doing what is necessary to free you from the chains that have 
   been woven through multiple incarnations and hopefully to make your 
   consciousness aware in the present, so that you will cease to weave 
   additional chains.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>For you see the purpose of life is not to continue the 
   rebirth cycle forever. The purpose of life is to learn the lessons of 
   the physical plane and to graduate to the spiritual levels. And this 
   also is but another step in the journey back to the source of your creation.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The physical plane is a class room but there are other 
   levels beyond that also have their lessons to be learned.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Over time for those who are genuinely interested we 
   shall be transmitting this information. We hope that you will benefit 
   from it. The most difficult thing for the human consciousness to do; 
   the most difficult task for the human is to do something that is 
   beneficial for the self; to do things that are good for self. There 
   is a vast difference between that and selfish behavior. This is a 
   point that we shall discuss in the future. For now we will hope that 
   you will contemplate the seeming contradictions of pride versus 
   humility and then perhaps an important lesson will be learned.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Our blessings upon you this evening. We thank you for 
   attending and hope that however your consciousness receives our words 
   that it will benefit you in some way. And with that, I shall say GOOD EVENING.</FONT>
