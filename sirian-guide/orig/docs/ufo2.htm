   Spring-Summer 1974
  </P>
  <P>
   This report is posted in memory of my father, the witness to these events.
  </P>
  <P>
   In 1974, the Southeastern United States was having a very large UFO 
   flap. It was during this time that two fishermen were picked up in 
   Mississippi in an incident that was widely reported in the media. 
   Less publicity was given, however, to the multitude of sightings that 
   occurred in Central Alabama.
  </P>
  <P>
   At this time, my father was working maintenance at a small, private 
   airport about three miles West of his small Alabama home town. He was 
   usually alone at the airport as there was no staff.
  </P>
  <P>
   In the late Spring, around dusk, he started noticing a large, disk 
   shaped craft that would silently approach the airport. There appeared 
   to be a ring of port-holes around the rim with light shining out.
  </P>
  <P>
   This craft would fly the perimeter of the airport shining a brilliant 
   white beam of light down at the ground. It would move around very 
   purposely, almost as if mapping the place and then leave.
  </P>
  <P>
   This took place several times. My father told the supervisor of the 
   airport property but was laughed at. So, he challenged the man to be 
   down at the airport at the time this flying disk appeared. In an 
   attempt to show my father up, the supervisor did come to the airport 
   at the appropriate time.
  </P>
  <P>
   Although he was expecting a big laugh, he got what he didn't expect. 
   The flying saucer showed up silently around the appropriate time and 
   shined that brilliant white beam of light down on the ground, calmly 
   tracing over the ground like it had done a number of times in the 
   recent past. The supervisor turned white and didn't say a word. He 
   just got in his truck and left, never mentioning the incident again.
  </P>
  <P>
   This flying saucer appeared a number of times during the Spring and 
   Summer of 1974. One evening, my father decided to shine a spotlight 
   at it to see what it would do. He aimed the spotlight at the flying 
   disk and turned on the powerful beam. Simultaneously with the 
   spotlight, the saucer went dark and disappeared. My father turned off 
   the spotlight. A few minutes later, the saucer reappeared farther 
   away and started the brilliant white beam again tracing the ground.
  </P>
  <P>
   I do not know how many times my father observed this circular craft. 
   It happened more than once and at a fairly regular time. Consistent 
   enough that he got a witness to observe the saucer.
  </P>
  <P>
   It is obvious that some form of consciousness was operating the 
   saucer as it responded to a light beam directed at it. Also, it was 
   very purposely tracing the ground with that brilliant white light beam.
  </P>
  <P>
   There were numerous witnesses to UFO activity in 1974 in Central 
   Alabama. However, to my knowledge, there was never any investigation. 
   If there are any witnesses to the Central Alabama UFO Flap of 
   1973-75, I'd like to hear from you and post your experiences. Just 
   e-mail from this web site.
