   <FONT SIZE=4>CAN WE BE PROTECTED FROM DEATH? - CASES OF PARANORMAL INTERVENTION</FONT>
  </P>

   by Robert M. Stone, M.S.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I have pondered this over the years and can say, YES. You see, there 
   have been more than the average number of times in my life when I 
   should have been killed but was not. Each time, it seemed as if some 
   force was altering the environment and people in the environment, if 
   they were around, to protect me. I will relate three such incidents.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   1969 was the year hurricane Camille, the most powerful hurricane 
   since records have been kept, tore through the Gulf of Mexico. Ten 
   days after the storm passed by our area, fortunately, my family went 
   to visit some friends in the Ft. Walton Beach, Florida area. Their 
   friends had a 30 foot cabin cruiser and the men decided to take the 
   boys fishing. Their was my father, myself, my father's friend and his 
   two sons.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The water of the Gulf was still displaced even ten days after the 
   storm. The surge was still pushing the tide higher than normal. Also, 
   the water was very disturbed. We went through the Destin pass and 
   into the Gulf. The pass at Destin was like a funnel and the waves 
   were pretty rough in it. Once out in the Gulf, the waves were large 
   but more rolling. Everything went fine until we started to come back 
   into the pass.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Literally, the propeller quit spinning. The motor ran but there was 
   no motion. Without power, the oversized waves were beginning to wash 
   over the stern. We were taking on water. In addition, we were heading 
   towards the rocks and sharks were all over the place.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The boat was not equipped with a radio. Quite far away, we could see 
   a large commercial boat. We attempted to signal it but the noise of 
   the waves and wind were high. Strangely enough, they quickly started 
   coming towards us. There was no way they could have heard us. They 
   would have had to be paying close attention to see that we were in 
   trouble as the boats integrity was still in place. Yet, this very 
   large boat was moving in our direction. When they got within shouting 
   distance, we could hear them yelling to throw a rope.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The owner of the boat quickly got out a heavy rope, secured one end 
   and threw it to the large commercial craft. The water was really 
   washing into the boat now. He missed with the rope! But then, the 
   biggest wave I had seen in the pass that day washed through and 
   raised the rope up to where a sailor on the bow of the commercial 
   craft reached out and caught it!!!
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   We just watched in stunned silence as this sequence of events unfolded.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The commercial craft tied the rope to their bow and backed us out of 
   the pass. Once out of the pass, we stopped taking water and the 
   commercial craft then attached the rope to their stern and towed us 
   through the pass to safety.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I will never forget that strange wave that all but handed the sailor 
   the rope that our throw had missed and allowed us to be rescued.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The next event I wanted to mention happened in 1976. I was in 
   Graduate school at the time. I lived in a small town about 45 miles 
   from the college and commuted to classes.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   One afternoon, I was going to the school to do some research for my 
   thesis. It had been raining fairly hard but had slacked up. The road 
   that I had traveled several hundred times up to that point was a good 
   road and although wet, was not slippery.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I had entered a long straight stretch on the road when my attention 
   was drawn to a strange motion that the back of the car made. Other 
   than a light sprinkle, it had stopped raining. I was doing the 55 mph 
   speed limit. At this point in my life, I had been driving for eight 
   years and had never felt this before. A few seconds later, I 
   discovered what it was. The back tires had lost traction.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The road was straight, there was no traffic, I wasn't speeding and 
   the back tires now had no traction. Very shortly, I was sliding 
   sideways down the highway. Then the car started to spin. At first, 
   fairly straight down the road but then it started moving to the side.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Everything seemed to slow down. As the car left the road, I pushed 
   the brakes, knowing it wouldn't make any difference but just to do 
   something. I looked at the speedometer and it was reading 50 mph. I 
   thought to myself, &quot;Well, this is it.&quot;
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   But it wasn't. It was like the car was in jello. It went off an 
   incline into a wet ditch and in 15 feet, decelerated from 50 mph to 
   0! Water was not flying everywhere as you would expect. The car just stopped.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I sat there rather stunned. I looked around. Fifty feet in either 
   direction, I would have hit a telephone pole or a large tree. Fifty 
   feet at 50 mph is nothing.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Neither the car nor myself were injured. In fact, the only damage to 
   the car was where the wrecker attached the hook to pull it out of the 
   wet ditch.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I knew that day that it was NOT my time to die. There is no question 
   that something externally prevented it because the rules of physics 
   were broken that day.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The last incident I will relate occurred in 1982. At that time, I was 
   into automobile repair and enhancements and was working on a very 
   large, 1976 Oldsmobile 98.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The car was up on ramps and I was working on the exhaust system. To 
   get to parts of the exhaust system, I had to remove some parts such 
   as the started and automatic transmission linkage.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I had been working on it for several hours and was having difficulty 
   getting a bolt loose. About that time, my 14 year old son came out of 
   the house to chat. Usually, he was out with his friends doing the 
   normal teenage thing. As a matter of fact, I wondered why he was home 
   on an early afternoon.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   However, I shortly found out.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I was on the driver side of the car lying on my back at a 90 degree 
   angle. From my position, the middle of my ribcage was centered with 
   the tire. My son had been there less than 5 minutes when I accidently 
   hit the transmission lock out and unlocked the transmission.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The car rolled right down the ramp onto my side. As it was coming 
   down I had time to think that I was going to die and had a blur of 
   images flash before me. The car rolled onto my side pinning me to the 
   driveway. Needless to say I couldn't breath. Of course my son was in 
   shock. With difficulty, I told him to get in the car and press the 
   brake. The car was inoperable because the starter was off. But he got 
   in and pushed on the brake. Pushing on the brake stopped the car from 
   rolling further.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Then I proceeded to get out from under the wheel which had pinched my 
   ribcage. I still don't know how I got out. I do know that my shirt 
   was still under the tire when I got out. Just my t-shirt was on.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I got a brick and put it under the back wheel to stop the car from 
   rolling further. I then went in the house and collapsed.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I went to the emergency room at my wife's insistance but the doctor 
   could find no damage. There were no broken bones and no bruising. The 
   skin was even abraded where I had scrubbed against the rough concrete 
   of the driveway to get out from under the wheel. My side was sore but 
   that was about it.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   When I closed my eyes for several days afterwards, I could see that 
   car rolling down on me.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   My teenage son, who like most teenagers, was never home in the 
   afternoons was guided to be home that day. And I still can't explain 
   how a very heavy car, rolling down a 3.5 foot ramp on an inclined 
   driveway did not seriously injure me. Not to mention how I got out 
   from under the wheel. Again, there was some external force at work.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   There have been several other equally as dramatic interventions in my 
   life that have kept me from dying but I believe I've illustrated the 
   point. There CAN be an external force that protects you.
