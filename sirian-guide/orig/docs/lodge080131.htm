   London, Jan. 30. -- That he has succeeded in obtaining communications 
   from the spirits of persons formerly well known in London as the 
   result of secret and exhaustive tests recently conducted in 
   connection with spiritualism is the astonishing statement just made 
   by Sir Oliver Lodge, Principal of the Birmingham University and 
   holder of a long list of distinguished degrees in science and 
   scholarship to the members of the Psychical Research Society here.
  </P>
  <P>
   Three well-known persons are named by Sir Oliver as having sent 
   messages to him through mediums from beyond the grave. They are the 
   late Edmund Gurney, the late Richard Hodgson, and the late F. W. H. Meyers.
  </P>
  <P>
   The latter was a brilliant writer of English prose and a leading 
   member of the Psychical Research Society. He died in 1901 at Rome and 
   declared just before his death that he intended to attempt to 
   communicate with the members of the society after his death.
  </P>
  <P>
   Sir Oliver said in part:
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;On the question of the life hereafter the excavators are 
   engaged in boring a tunnel from the opposite ends. Amid the roar of 
   the water and the other noises we are beginning to hear the strokes 
   of the pickaxes of our comrades on the other side. We have received 
   what an investigation has proved to be messages from the dead through 
   the mediums, Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Verrall.&quot;
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;The latter is endowed to a remarkable degree with the power to 
   act as a translator or interpreter of the psychical and the physical 
   worlds. We have discovered that there is a new human faculty for 
   communicating with the dead. The most important set of phenomena are 
   those of astomatic(sic) writing and talking. Well-known persons, 
   including those I have named, are constantly purporting to 
   communicate with us with the express purpose of patently proving 
   their known personalities, and giving evidence of knowledge 
   appropriate to them.&quot;
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;Not easily or early do we make this admission, in spite of long 
   conversations with what purports to be the surviving intelligence of 
   those friends and investigators. We were by no means convinced of 
   their identity until crucial proof, difficult even to imagine, had, 
   according to some of our beliefs, been supplied.&quot;
  </P>
  <P>
   Sir Oliver Lodge will give out later definite illustrations of his 
   surprising spiritualistic tests.

  <P>
   Prof. James H. Hyslop, formerly Professor of Logic and Ethics at 
   Columbia University, a member of the Psychical Research Society, at 
   his home, 519 West 149th Street, said last night that Prof. Lodge was 
   one of the best-known and most distinguished scientists in England.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;What he says is quite true,&quot; went on Prof. Hyslop. &quot;I 
   have taken messages from Mrs. Piper myself. Only ignorant people now 
   doubt that Mrs. Piper and such as she is can communicate with the 
   spirit world. Richard Hodgson established his identity several years 
   ago through the mediums. Edmund Gurney made himself known through the 
   mediums as far back as 1889. I have talked with Hodgson myself.&quot;
  </P>
  <P>
   Just as THE TIMES reporter was walking out of the door Prof. Hyslop said:
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;And as for this man Frederick Myers, why, I talked with him 
   myself today.:
  </P>
  <P>
   Prof. Hyslop has been Secretary of the American Society for Psychical 
   Research, and has published a great deal of matter in the Proceedings 
   of the Society for Psychical Research.
  </P>
  <P>
   Sir Oliver Joseph Lodge, who has given the weight of his opinion to 
   the theory of spirit manifestations, has been often honored for work 
   in scientific research. He is about 57 years old, is a Fellow of the 
   Royal Society, and has degrees from Oxford, St. Andrew's, Glasgow and 
   other great British universities. He is the author of numerous 
   scientific works and is one of the widest known of living English scientists.
  </P>
  <P>
   Mrs. Piper was for eighteen years a coworker of Dr. Hodgson's and for 
   that reasons Prof. Hyslop did not consider the messages received at 
   her seances of as much values as the ones received through &quot;a 
   young girl.&quot; Before his death, Dr. Hodgson and Prof. Hyslop 
   experimented with the girl, and the Hodgson spirit always referred to 
   her as the &quot;young light,&quot; among other things saying that 
   she is all right.&quot;
