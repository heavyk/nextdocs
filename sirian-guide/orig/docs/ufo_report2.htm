            <p>I brought a friend home from school with me one weekend to the 
            Gadsden (Alabama) area, and she and I both has a very memorable 
            sighting. &nbsp;The pinpoint of light that eight minutes ago was 
            many thousands of yards away grew uncomfortably close. &nbsp;Lindsay 
            and I sat on the dock in Riddles Bend over the dark waters of the 
            Coosa River beneath a spray of stars, mystified. &nbsp;I do not 
            remember the moon. &nbsp;As the lighted craft approached, we wondered 
            to each other why a boat would be cruising down the river at nine 
            at night. &nbsp;Its light was brighter now, concentrated on the 
            opposite shoreline like a spotlight. &nbsp;A police cruiser, perhaps? 
            &nbsp;But it was so huge. &nbsp;Maybe fifty yards long. &nbsp;And 
            there was complete silence. &nbsp;No whirring of a boat motor. &nbsp;No 
            helicopter blades chopping and stabbing at the air. &nbsp;There 
            was no frothy wake smacking against the dock. &nbsp;This lack of 
            natural physical effects was eerie considering its great size.</p>
            <p>Lindsay and I were immobile as it moved past us. &nbsp;It seemed 
            to hover above the water as opposed to gliding through it. &nbsp;Three 
            ovular white lights on the bottom barely illuminated the river below. 
            &nbsp;Frightened yet astounded by the sight, we understood the boundlessness 
            of the galaxy. &nbsp;At that moment we became the hostesses of this 
            planet. &nbsp;We had been visited. &nbsp;Walking back to my grandmother's 
            house, I could feel the hair erect itself on my arms, the back of 
            my neck. &nbsp;Shaken and bewildered, we whispered of the possibilities. 
            &nbsp;To think that we remain the sole occupants of the universe 
            is arrogant and absurd. </p>
