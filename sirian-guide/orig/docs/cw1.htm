   <FONT SIZE=4>I WAS IN THE CIVIL WAR<br></FONT>   by Robert M. Stone, M.S.
  </P>
  <P>
   The concept of reincarnation had always intrigued me since I first 
   read about it in Jane Robert's, <B>The Seth Material</B> in 1972. I 
   did a great deal of reading that summer but nothing I read allowed me 
   to explore the topic personally. It wasn't until 1976, when I was a 
   Graduate Student that I was told about Leslie Lecron's, <B>Self-Hypnotism,
    It's Use in Daily Living</B> by a fellow Graduate Student that the 
   tools, subconscious communication and hypnosis, presented themselves.
  </P>
  <P>
   I read all the books the University had on hypnosis but they weren't 
   as helpful as Lecron's. Using his techniques, a friend and I started 
   trying to track down our previous existence's.
  </P>
  <P>
   The pendulum made it simple to start gathering information on 
   previous lives. Using the questioning techniques suggested by Lecron, 
   we quickly began to pin down details of other lives, some of which we 
   had shared together.
  </P>
  <P>
   My friend had a flare for being hypnotized and we gathered 
   information in this manner. But a side-effect that we discovered in 
   using the pendulum to ask the subconscious questions about past lives 
   was that we began to have past life dreams. At various times, both my 
   friend and I would have the same sort of dream with the same details.
  </P>
  <P>
   When this began to happen, I realized that I had several of these 
   types of dreams at various points in my childhood. I had never 
   understood the significance of them until, as an adult exploring 
   reincarnation, the same thing happened.
  </P>
  <P>
   The most vivid dream I had I still remember after all these years. 
   The dream was in full color with all the senses involved.
  </P>
  <UL>
  <P>
   It was early morning, almost dawn. There was a low ground fog. There 
   was a camp with tents and stacked rifles. Men were beginning to stir. 
   My attention was drawn to a tall man with white blond hair shoulder 
   length. He had on his pants and boots but had not put on his tunic.
  </P>
  <P>
   This was a Union Army camp. I quickly realized that the tall man was 
   me. Although he was about 5 inches taller than I am and I've never 
   had should length hair. Also, my hair is brown.
  </P>
  <P>
   It looked like the preparations for breakfast were beginning with 
   coffee pots on stones around the campfires.
  </P>
  <P>
   The camp appeared to be on the edge of a large cornfield. The air was 
   chilly and damp. I noticed that I was picking up glimpses of the 
   world through his eyes. He was standing by a campfire looking out 
   over the cornfield. As it began to get light, he noticed that there 
   was a huge gray line at the other edge of the cornfield with a few 
   dots of crimson breaking up the line.
  </P>
  <P>
   At the same time he could see the line, there was a massive shout and 
   the line began to surge forward. The shout is hard to describe. It 
   was almost a continuous drone. The trademark Confederate battle cry. 
   I had never seen nor heard anything like it. There is a serious 
   difference between being in the middle of something like that as 
   opposed to watching it on a movie or television. There is no comparison.
  </P>
  <P>
   When the line was set in motion, it was ME looking at it trying to 
   assess the situation. Everyone was scrambling to move as this camp 
   was in no way defensible and would be quickly overrun.
  </P>
  <P>
   I found myself having a moral dilemma. Should I escape or try to 
   fight. I quickly decided that getting killed would serve no purpose 
   and ordered a retreat.
  </P>
  <P>
   We headed for the river. There was this steep ravine that led down to 
   the river and we stumbled down it. The river was gigantic. We swam 
   across it.
  </P>
  <P>
   As this was happening, my current consciousness was watching somewhat 
   confused. So I heard myself yell out, &quot;Where is this?&quot; and 
   the answer came back like an echo, &quot;SHILOH.&quot;
  </P>
  </UL>
  <P>
   I wasn't familiar with Shiloh so I looked it up at the University 
   library and discovered it was a Civil War battle in April of 1862. 
   That the Confederate forces had launched a massive, SURPRISE attack 
   on the Union forces. Well, I can personally vouch for that !
  </P>
  <P>
   Twelve years after the dream, I decided to go to Shiloh. It was in a 
   part of Tennessee that I had never been to. Of course, the 
   battlefield is now a National Park.
  </P>
  <P>
   To make a very long story short, I had a number of flashback memories 
   surface on the trip to Shiloh. The next day when I went to the park, 
   I found the field of my dream. Then in moving around the park, I 
   discovered that side of the river had a high cliff, at least 75-100 
   feet high. The river of course, was the Tennessee and it was wide as 
   the Mississippi at that point.
  </P>
  <P>
   In driving around the service road, I came to some Indian mounds that 
   overlooked the river. I stopped and climbed them to look at the 
   river. When I returned to the car, I looked down the road which 
   looked straight from my vantage point and said, &quot;The ravine to 
   the river is around a corner not far from here.&quot;
  </P>
  <P>
   I got in the car and in less than 50 yards, the road took a 90 degree 
   turn which could not be seen from the mounds and moved at a sharp 
   angle down the RAVINE which led to the river. It was the ONLY access 
   to the river for miles in either direction. That is, unless you 
   wanted to jump off 100 foot banks.
  </P>
  <P>
   I can't tell you the feelings that walking this ground generated in 
   me. But finding the field and finding the ravine clearly demonstrated 
   to me that I had been there in April 1862.
  </P>
  <P>
   Critics of reincarnation can say that all fields look the same which 
   is probably true. However, how did I know there was a ravine that was 
   the only feasible access to the river?
  </P>
  <P>
   Reincarnation is a fact for me. Knowing that you lived before helps 
   to understand the self of the present.
