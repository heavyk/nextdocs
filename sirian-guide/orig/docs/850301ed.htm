  <TITLE>Life After Death: Knowledge to Dispel Fear by Djwahl Kuhl (DK)</TITLE>
  <META NAME="description" CONTENT="In 1985, Djwahl Kuhl (DK) presented a series of lectures on a topic that most people would prefer not to think about...death. As he so aptly pointed out, it is an experience that everyone without exception will eventually face. The intent of these lectures was to emphasize that life is ETERNAL and what we believe in life determines what we will experience in the afterlife. The message is clear, death is not to be feared, it is a change. It is not the end, it is a beginning.">

   A Channeled Lecture by Djwahl Kuhl (DK) Presented March 1, 1985

   <FONT SIZE=3>[EDITOR'S NOTE: THE FOLLOWING IS A VERBATIM TRANSCRIPT 
   FROM THE SESSION TAPE. WORDS ADDED FOR CLARITY WILL BE IN [ ], WORDS 
   OMITTED WILL BE DENOTED BY ..... THE REST IS JUST AS IT WAS SPOKEN]</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Greetings to you along the path. It is I D.K. and 
   tonight we would like to begin our discussion on the topic of life 
   after death.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In Western Culture this is one of the areas that is most 
   neglected. People fear death. People would prefer not to think about 
   it. When people think of death they think of the cost, the funeral 
   home, sadness; a loss. They think of their loved one ceasing to be. 
   However, death is a fact of life; it is something that all will 
   eventually face. Some sooner, some later. And so, a brief history.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The history of man as you know him today only begins 
   with the destruction of Atlantis. You will recall in our previous 
   discussion that we explained that humanity at the time of Atlantis 
   existed as much on the astral plane as on the physical. It was 
   difficult for them to distinguish when something was physical or when 
   it was astral. They could quite easily slip from their physical into 
   what you refer as an astral projection. The concept of death was not 
   one that they pondered to any great extent. It was only when the dark 
   ages towards the end of Atlantis set in that the fixation in gross 
   matter began to influence the consciousness of humanity.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The land of Atlantis had a unique set of vibrational 
   patterns and electromagnetic fields. These conditions influenced 
   consciousness. There are certain lands in existence today that in a 
   milder form have the same effect, the British Isles are an example.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>With the destruction of the land known as Atlantis, the 
   downward spiral of humanity into gross matter was completed. Millions 
   upon millions of people, or physical vehicles, ceased to exist when 
   Atlantis was destroyed. They were forced to begin incarnating into 
   other vehicles that existed and were acclimated to different parts of 
   the globe. These vehicles did not have the unique conditions that 
   caused the separation of spirit and matter. However, the incarnating 
   Atlantean entities retained the instinct for the continued existence 
   of spirit. They continued to have the instinct for the realm that you 
   call the Astral plane.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Not all of the entities were destroyed with the sinking 
   of Atlantis. Those that survived carried their knowledge with them to 
   other parts of the world. They introduced into other cultures 
   conceptions of the Astral world. And they were introduced to the 
   conception of death as other consciousnesses perceived them.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Many of them began to record their experiences as they 
   encountered different cultures. They discovered that their 
   environment that they had was rather unique. Other cultures did not 
   have the same loosening of the energies that resulted in the loose 
   connection between spirit and matter.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>To the teaching entities that were incarnated into the 
   Atlantean vehicles, it became evident that this information needed to 
   be recorded so that the other cultures could benefit from the 
   knowledge. Thus, such works as the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and the 
   Tibetan Book of the Dead came into existence. The limitations imposed 
   on the works were related to the cultures that the teachers contacted 
   and chose to settle within. Those works that survive today suffer 
   from translation difficulties and also the fact that they were worded 
   in terms that the culture of the time could understand. Due to this, 
   much of the information has been rejected by Western Culture.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The people of the times when these works were recorded 
   did not accurately interpret the material. Independently, over time, 
   they put into practice their interpretations of the material and 
   constructed behaviors based on their interpretations. These were not 
   always accurate or constructive. As Western Scientists, 
   Archaeologists and Anthropologists uncovered some of these cultures 
   practices, it was easy for them to discount the material contained in 
   the works due to the practices of the cultures of which the works 
   were representative. The further from the original Atlanteans, the 
   greater the distortions and yet humanity has had the instinct of spirit.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The first rule to remember when one passes over the 
   threshold called &quot;death&quot; is that you get exactly what you 
   expect. If you expect nothing, you get nothing: if you expect angels, 
   you get angels. Most people expect nothing and they find themselves 
   in a gray, dreary land. They have so much of the etheric still 
   attached that they remain close to the physical. They find themselves 
   in &quot;Limbo&quot;, a twilight zone if you will. They cannot see 
   that which is higher and that which is lower. Usually, we cannot see 
   them. They wander for many earth years in this state, lost, forlorn, confused.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Many cultures have examined the plight of these 
   unfortunate spirits. In the Greek culture it was discussed in 
   reference to the underworld and many of the heroes of Greek history 
   encountered these unfortunate spirits. Many different cultures have 
   acknowledged the existence of these unfortunate ones. Even to this 
   day you carry out the practice that acknowledges their existence. 
   It's called &quot;Halloween&quot;.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The plight of any consciousness so entangled is very 
   unnecessary. A lack of understanding of the nature of reality, a lack 
   of understanding of the purpose of physical existence contributes to 
   millions of entities experiencing such entrapment.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Over the next series of communications, when conditions 
   are appropriate, we shall attempt to explain what one experiences at 
   the transition referred to as death so that with the conscious 
   knowledge the entity will not have to experience Limbo.</FONT>
