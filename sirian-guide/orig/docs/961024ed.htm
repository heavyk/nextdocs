   [EDITOR'S NOTE: THE FOLLOWING IS A VERBATIM TRANSCRIPT FROM THE 
   SESSION TAPE. WORDS ADDED FOR CLARITY WILL BE IN [ ], WORDS OMITTED 
   WILL BE DENOTED BY ..... THE REST IS JUST AS IT WAS SPOKEN]
  </P>
  <P>
   It is I DK........... Recently we broached a topic that has never 
   been discussed by us. And that involves the alien civilizations and 
   their direct attempt to intervene and intersperse themselves among humanity.
  </P>
  <P>
   We have already presented, through one of our colleagues, information 
   regarding the gray civilizations. Tonight we would like to present 
   information that concerns the Peacekeepers; the alien civilizations 
   that prevent the gray civilizations from indiscriminately exploiting 
   the entire human population.
  </P>
  <P>
   As has been mentioned the gray civilizations made their pact in 1930 
   and the door was opened for them to begin their process of 
   integrating themselves into the human population through a loophole 
   in the charter related to the planet earth.
  </P>
  <P>
   The loophole is simply that any aspect of the earth, any fraction of 
   the earth aspect, is considered a part of the earth and it's 
   geosphere. Hence, their attempts to process themselves into genetic 
   structure that consists of elements of the planet.
  </P>
  <P>
   That was covered, although in somewhat sketchy detail, at the last 
   communication. We are sure that there are a number of questions to be 
   resolved concerning that information. And when those questions are 
   formulated we will address them.
  </P>
  <P>
   Tonight we are going to discuss the Peacekeepers response to the loophole.
  </P>
  <P>
   It had long been anticipated by the Peacekeepers that the gray 
   civilizations would eventually discover the loophole. Thus, for many 
   centuries the peace keepers were planning their response to this back 
   door attempt to infiltrate the human population.
  </P>
  <P>
   The Peacekeepers are quite physical and they do have a life span. 
   This life span in human years is approximately ten thousand.
  </P>
  <P>
   The Peacekeepers have been interacting and watching over humanity for 
   hundreds of thousands of years for the human vehicle has existed in 
   different forms for at least two million years. However, the current 
   form did not manifest until approximately one hundred thousand years. 
   This new form is the version that each of you are familiar with. It 
   is the only surviving representation of the previous human vehicles 
   that were created.
  </P>
  <P>
   Realizing the gray civilization would ultimately discover the 
   loophole; also realizing that the gray civilizations did not have and 
   would never have the technology to effectively alter genetic 
   structure, the Peacekeepers decided that they would manufacture a 
   form of human that could serve as a host vehicle for an alien spirit. 
   The Peacekeepers do have the technology and the capacity to create 
   life. They have the capacity to work at the genetic level.
  </P>
  <P>
   They started the process approximately three hundred years ago 
   selecting various genetic lines and following those genetic lines. 
   These genetic lines were identified and tracked.
  </P>
  <P>
   The genetic lines were selected for durability. They were selected 
   for the capacity to handle high energy of a natural order. And they 
   were selected due to the nature of the spirits inhabiting them. For 
   alien spirits, alien entities, have been among the human population 
   since the creation of the final form of mankind one hundred thousand 
   years in the past.
  </P>
  <P>
   The genetic lines have been tracked, were catalogued, and the 
   inhabiting forms or spirits were studied. It was discovered that 
   compromises would have to be made as to the nature of the spirits or 
   entities inhabiting these vehicles at a given time.
  </P>
  <P>
   Due to the superior nature of these vehicles, alien spirits were in 
   competition to manifest in them but not all of these alien spirits 
   were benevolent. This was unfortunate for due to the time when the 
   activation process was necessitated, a number of the genetic vehicles 
   were contaminated by malevolent alien entities.
  </P>
  <P>
   However, after researching the issues the Peacekeepers discovered 
   that a number of factors were in operation. The omnipotence of the 
   nature of karma was at work. It was discovered that the spirits that 
   needed to inhabit the enhanced vehicles had karmic issues to be 
   resolved. When the program was set in motion in 1930, a combination 
   of malevolent and benevolent alien entities inhabited the genetic 
   strains that had been tracked and selected for use.
  </P>
  <P>
   The best case scenario was one in which little or no karma existed 
   between the host and the spirit that needed to manifest. The worst 
   case scenario was bitter enemies from a karmic standpoint being 
   reunited. This unfortunately had to be utilized despite the impact on 
   the spirit that needed to manifest at the time.
  </P>
  <P>
   The procedure for the manifestation was simple. Genetic material was 
   collected from the hosts, that being the female and male partners of 
   the genetically compatible pairs. The genetic materials were then 
   taken to the primary processing laboratory in the northern part of 
   the continental United States. At this laboratory the birth actually 
   took place. The genetic material was enhanced. Features were added, 
   circuitry was added to augment the energy capacity of the vehicles.
  </P>
  <P>
   However it was a necessity that these alterations remain undetected. 
   Consequently the degree of modification was limited so that the 
   technology of the time would notice no difference between a normal 
   human body and the genetically altered ones. A number of peculiar 
   characteristics existed for the genetically altered ones including 
   blood pressure variations, body temperature variations, hormonal 
   imbalances to name a few.
  </P>
  <P>
   Our purpose here this evening is not to define the distinctive 
   characteristics of the genetically altered vehicles. It's simply to 
   convey the manner in which they came to be.
  </P>
  <P>
   The genetic materials were processed in the laboratory. The eggs and 
   the sperm were genetically altered so that the appropriate 
   manifestation would occur. They were then joined in the laboratory 
   for the fertilization to take place.
  </P>
  <P>
   When the process had been completed and the necessary modifications 
   made and the being was set in motion, a pair, consisting of an alien 
   male and alien female Peacekeeper, were assigned to each developing embryo.
  </P>
  <P>
   In a sense you could say that these were the true parents of the 
   developing being. A bonding took place between the being and the 
   spirit that was to inhabit the developing being, and between the 
   alien mother and father figure. This bonding occurred on three levels 
   of consciousness as the Peacekeepers view reality from a three level 
   plane. They operate at what humans call the subconscious level and 
   utilize the subconscious to its maximum extent. The human vehicle 
   utilizes less than three percent of the subconscious structure.
  </P>
  <P>
   When the embryo was set in motion, the specific entity, who was 
   usually non-physical at the time, was matched to the embryo. The 
   entity appeared or was summoned to the research facility. Of course 
   being non-physical was of little consequence to the Peacekeepers for 
   they interacted with what you call the astral and the mental levels 
   with as much facility as the physical levels.
  </P>
  <P>
   Extensive discussions took place before each given spirit selected to 
   participate in the program and bond themselves to the embryo. When 
   such a commitment was completed the embryo was transported to the 
   host and implanted in the female so that for all practical purposes a 
   normal gestation process would take place.
  </P>
  <P>
   This was an effective technique although it did produce a few 
   surprises for a number of the hosts were either practicing their own 
   methods of birth control or the female had been deemed incapable due 
   to hormonal imbalances or other gynecological problems from being 
   able to bear children. In some instances the female structure, the 
   birth canal for example, or the pelvic girdle were incapable of 
   adequately providing an access for the birth process. These, of 
   course, could be dealt with by the human technology that existed in 
   various forms. So even though the vehicle of the host, of the female 
   host, was not necessarily suitable for a normal birth, technology was 
   adequate so that the process could manifest itself. And the survival 
   rate was exceptional due to the strength of the entities that were 
   bonding to these modified vehicles.
  </P>
  <P>
   The hosts, depending on the karmic associations with the entities who 
   selected to manifest, reacted with awe, indifference or overt 
   hostility. This was indirectly addressed with counseling sessions 
   from the alien peace keepers. But the nature of the experience, the 
   artificial quality, could not be alleviated. And most of the entities 
   who selected to manifest in the altered vehicles did not identify 
   with the hosts.
  </P>
  <P>
   In most instances, only one modified vehicle was interjected, 
   however, there were as many as two at times. But the majority 
   consisted of a single experience even though the hosts ultimately 
   produced offspring of their own. The difference between the two, of 
   course, was substantial.
  </P>
  <P>
   The nature of the Peacekeepers holds the triad, the perfect structure 
   of the universe, as a key element. In recognition of the triad, a 
   three year cycle is celebrated. Every three years the modified 
   vehicles enter a new phase; a phase of growth; a phase of expansion. 
   And this three year cycle is celebrated by the Peacekeepers; by the 
   entities themselves, in the altered state of consciousness that 
   occurs when night time visitations of the Peacekeepers are presented.
  </P>
  <P>
   The three year cycle, its' significance, represents the trinity or 
   the triad representing the positive, the negative and the neutral. 
   Beginning at the age of three the Peacekeepers present themselves to 
   the child and are accepted as the parents, if you will.
  </P>
  <P>
   This experience is of great significance for the developing 
   consciousness for at this point they can see that there are, or there 
   exists a structure, consisting of the male and female that does 
   approximate what they have learned to be a family unit, although they 
   do not relate to the host family unit to any great extent.
  </P>
  <P>
   The greetings, the information exchanged, the presentation at the age 
   of three, is a momentous and joyous one. And it will continue 
   throughout the life of the vehicle every third year. The entire third 
   year is a celebration usually due to the changes invoked by the 
   increased energy in the expansion of consciousness.
  </P>
  <P>
   Each three year cycle tends to be stressful for the vehicle and the 
   heightened emotionalism accompanies this stress. However, at the 
   conclusion of a third year cycle, the entity is stronger, the energy 
   capacity is greater and they are more of what they truly are, which 
   is an alien in human form.
  </P>
  <P>
   It was necessary in the year 1989 to do modifications to the 
   vehicles. The modifications were manifested in the ethric bodies and 
   consisted of augmenting the energy flow paths so that the vehicles 
   could withstand the accelerated pace of energy that is necessary to 
   manifest, to manifest the ancient consciousness. That is required; 
   manifestation of the ancient consciousness that exists in each of the 
   entities that are incarnated into the modified human vehicles.
  </P>
  <P>
   The task of manifesting the ancient consciousness is not a simple 
   one. It will require conscious effort, much work and an 
   intensification of the energy through various means. However, it is 
   necessary that each of the alien entities that are inhabiting these 
   modified human forms recapture as much of the ancient wisdom as 
   possible for it will serve as a guide and a road map for the future 
   and for information that is greatly needed by the human population.
  </P>
  <P>
   The genetic engineering process is continuing except hosts are no 
   longer needed. The modified alien vehicles themselves with the 
   inhabiting spirits are contributing the genetic materials. And the 
   offspring from these unions are being extensively modified to serve 
   ultimately as a bridge between humanity and the high energy Peacekeepers.
  </P>
  <P>
   These children live with the Peacekeepers and are educated in the 
   ways of the Peacekeepers. They have no limitations, they have no 
   karma, they have only a oneness with the universe.
  </P>
  <P>
   The reason it is necessary to manifest the ancient wisdom in the 
   entities inhabiting the first generations of modified human vehicles 
   is that the foundation must be laid so that ultimately humanity will 
   be ready to accept their offspring. The offspring that they 
   themselves contributed to the creation, but who also have been 
   genetically engineered to more perfectly represent the alien energy pattern.
  </P>
  <P>
   The project is proceeding on schedule and the offspring are growing 
   to maturity. Many are adults and many children are continuing to be 
   constructed. When the time is right, when the foundation has been 
   laid, they will be integrated into the human population and serve as 
   guides for the continued development of human consciousness.
  </P>
  <P>
   In the meantime those of you that inhabit the modified vehicles must 
   strive to allow the energy to flow properly. Allow it to expand with 
   no limitations and work to retrieve the ancient wisdom and the basic 
   nature, the true nature, of your entity, of your spirit.
  </P>
  <P>
   The Peacekeepers will continue to work to countermand the threat that 
   the gray civilization poses to humanity. Alliances between humans and 
   the gray civilization do exist and do stand. However, even with human 
   cooperation world domination by the gray civilizations would never be allowed.
  </P>
  <P>
   Unfortunately the alliances do produce exploitation of the population 
   governed by the alliances.
  </P>
  <P>
   This cannot be helped. It can be monitored. It can be diluted to an 
   extent but a great many of the victims of the gray civilization also 
   have a karmic attachment to them. And they are repeating a pattern 
   that was set in motion fifteen thousand years ago during the times of 
   Atlantis. Atlantis is another topic upon which much needs to be said 
   and we hope to cover in detail in future communications.
  </P>
  <P>
   We hope that the information this evening has served some useful 
   purpose. At best it is sketchy
  </P>
  <P>
   and we are sure there will be many questions. However, it is 
   difficult to formulate into words the complex nature of the project 
   that is in motion. And the conceptions, the ideas that need to be 
   presented are best presented without words. The limitations of 
   humanity, however, necessitate that language be used. The limitations 
   of the language will impact the extent of the information but there 
   are ways to overcome these limitations. And that is what, working 
   together, we shall endeavor to do.
  </P>
  <P>
   At this point we shall conclude the communication. There is much that 
   needs to be said and we hope that you shall create the opportunity 
   for further communications to take place. Our blessings upon you and 
   we hope that each of you will endeavor to overcome the limitations 
   that your individual personalities have placed upon you. For it is 
   necessary to overcome these limitations, to overcome the inertia that 
   you have each chosen for yourselves. It is necessary to become the 
   ancients once again. The ancients know no limitations and there are 
   no obstacles that can stand in the way of the ancient wisdom........
