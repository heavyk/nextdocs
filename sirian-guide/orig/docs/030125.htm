   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>In September 2001, shortly after the 
   terrorists' attack on the USA, I became ill with food poisoning. 
   Because I had never had food poisoning before, I initially thought it 
   was the flu, and because I thought it was the flu, I did not replace 
   the liquid that I kept throwing up for 24 hours. After two days of no 
   fluids I was seriously dehydrated and began to be disoriented. I 
   would fall asleep for what I thought was ten minutes only to find 
   upon awakening that four hours had passed.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>On the fourth day of my illness, my 
   disorientation and weakness increasing exponentially as time passed, 
   I had a vision. Three entities appeared beside my bed, all of them 
   dressed in long white robes. There were two women and one man. They 
   held before me a map of the state of Texas. The man reached around 
   the side of the map and pointed to the area near Austin. He said, 
   &quot;You must go to Chadwick, Texas.&quot; As they faded out of 
   sight, I fell back into my dehydration-induced state of semi-consciousness.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>After I recovered, I remembered the 
   vision but dismissed it as an hallucination brought on by my illness. 
   Frequently in childhood I had had hallucinations while sick, and so I 
   filed this experience away as the same thing. But it haunted me. This 
   &quot;hallucination&quot; was so specific, so clear in my mind, and 
   it was the first time I had ever been given a direct order. I decided 
   to do some research and see if the town of Chadwick, Texas existed.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>I checked Texas maps, US maps, and 
   did county and city searches on the Internet. Nowhere could I find a 
   reference to Chadwick, Texas. I chalked my vision up to illness and 
   did not give it another thought.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>Until a week later when I meditated. 
   As I sat on my cushion in my bedroom, trying to follow the chaotic 
   chain of thoughts that tralloped through my head, the entities 
   startled me by appearing before me again in my mind's eye. This time 
   they were emphatic; they held the Texas map before me, and the male 
   entity jabbed at the Central Texas area forcefully; &quot;You must go 
   to Chadwick, Texas,&quot; he repeated. When I got up from my 
   meditation, I was convinced that this was not a fluke. Somehow, I had 
   to find this place.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>Much to my astonishment, I did. About 
   a week later, casually cruising the Internet, I ran across an obscure 
   reference to Chadwick, Texas on <I>The Handbook of Texas Online</I> :</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Chadwick was located in the late 
   1800's northwest of Lometa, Texas in Lampasas County. Henry A. 
   Chadwick built a dam there on the Colorado River in 1879 in addition 
   to a sawmill, flour mill, and cotton gin. The Chadwick Mills were 
   soon in high demand, and wagons came from as far as San Antonio to 
   use them. By 1900 the town had become a popular scenic resort, with a 
   small hotel and outdoor dance platform near the mills. In the summer 
   of 1915 the west bank of the Colorado River was washed out by heavy 
   rains and the river's course shifted so drastically that it bypassed 
   the dam of Chadwick Mills. Attempts to restore the operations failed, 
   and the mills were abandoned. The railway station and post office 
   were closed by January, 1941. All that is left of the once popular 
   resort is a historical marker and a cemetery. (The Texas State 
   Historical Association, excerpt from article on Chadwick, Texas by 
   Alice J. Rhoades).</I></FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>I decided to travel to Lometa, the 
   town closet to the once-popular Chadwick. My boyfriend and I flew to 
   Austin, rented a car, and checked into a hotel. The next day, the 
   search for the long-lost city of Chadwick began.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>We drove for hours through miles of 
   endless ranch and cattle country, broken down farmhouses, and towns 
   with buildings dating back to the 1800's. But no Chadwick. We went to 
   a local library to do research. The librarian, an elderly woman who 
   was at least 80 years old and stated that she had lived in the area 
   all of her life, said she had never heard of Chadwick. There was one 
   reference to Chadwick on an audio tape that had been made in the 
   1960's by an old-timer who had been one of the first students at the 
   Chadwick school. There was one 1915 newspaper article on microfiche 
   referring to the flood that washed out the dam. Besides that, 
   nothing. It was as if the town had been there one day and vanished 
   the next.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>We continued to drive around the area 
   and on the next to last day, discouraged, we had turned around to go 
   back to the hotel. Suddenly a sign flashed by that we had missed the 
   first time around. It read, simply, &quot;Chadwick Cem.&quot; 
   Excited, we turned the car down a bumpy dirt road. After what seemed 
   miles, we ran across a small, hand painted sign on a piece of bark 
   nailed crookedly to a tree; it read &quot;cemetery&quot;, and there 
   was an arrow pointing up a small dirt road, bumpier than the one we 
   were already on.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>We drove for a long time in the 
   direction of the arrow. Finally we saw, on top of a hill, overlooking 
   the Colorado river in the distance, a very old wrought-iron arch and 
   gate that led into a quaint, well-cared-for cemetery. At the top of 
   the arch were letters that spelled out &quot;Chadwick&quot;. My heart 
   started to pound as we got out of the car; here was proof of the town 
   that I had been summoned to by three entities, but for what purpose I 
   had yet to find out.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>There were graves dating back to as 
   early as 1871, and some as late as 1976. The cemetery was clean and 
   obviously used. We looked around for awhile, admired the serenity of 
   the cemetery on it's hilltop, and then left, urged on by this discovery.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>We drove deeper into the woods, down 
   the dirt road. I felt like I was going back in time, the way all 
   signs of civilization dropped away and we were left alone in this 
   lush, primitive world with thick woods that scraped the sides of the 
   car. We decided to head in the direction of the River, since that's 
   where the mill had been. Logic dictated that if the cemetery were 
   still here, then the mill would be too.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>But as we approached the river our 
   hearts plummeted. NO TRESPASSING signs suddenly sprang up in all 
   directions, barring our journey any further. We stopped the car and 
   got out, and could hear the sound of the river rushing downstream in 
   the distance. But there were too many trees to see anything.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>As we journeyed back in the direction 
   of the cemetery, something else caught our attention. A distant 
   throbbing sensation was coming from the bottom of the car, or rather, 
   into the car from the ground. We stopped again and got out, both of 
   us staring at each other in wonder.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>It sounded like the heartbeat of the earth.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Thump-thump, thump-thump</I>. The 
   feeling came up through our feet and into our ears. We both heard it 
   and described the exact same thing to each other. We were standing in 
   the middle of nowhere, with the Colorado river only miles away. It 
   was utterly quiet, unnaturally quiet, except for that steady beating 
   that was both felt and heard, like when you lay your head on 
   someone's chest. The air around us felt charged and heavy. I felt 
   like I was on the verge of discovering something fantastic and 
   profound, but it never quite made it to my consciousness. But it was, 
   and is to this day, just on the tip of my tongue.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>The next day we found a main road 
   that led to the Colorado river, but miles from where the mill would 
   have been. Beside a bridge we found a small gold plaque commemorating 
   Mr. Chadwick and the town he had built from nothing. Beside the 
   plaque stood the cement grindstone that had been used at one time in 
   the mill of Chadwick, Texas.</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>I have never fully understood why I 
   was supposed to go to Chadwick. Was I supposed to find the earth's 
   heartbeat? Because if I was, I did. Or was this experience simply to 
   teach me to trust in my own psychic powers, something I have, from 
   time to time, had difficulty doing?</FONT></FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>In either case, it was a successful 
   trip because I accomplished both. And I paid my respects to the 
   people of Chadwick, Texas, the ghost town that summoned me.</FONT></FONT>
