   <FONT SIZE=4>AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL VIEW OF CREATION - PART THREE</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>PRESENTED JUNE 12, 1984</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   Dear children and beloved colleagues. I am here once again to 
   continue the saga of creation.
  </P>
  <P>
   A point to be clarified from the last time is that the plane that was 
   labeled the SOUL LEVEL was not the midpoint as such; it was the point 
   where the transformation into form began. It only became the midpoint 
   at a later time but it has always served as the transformation point.
  </P>
  <P>
   Where we left off the last time; it was about time to animate the 
   ASTRAL PLANE with the first group of children of the New Universe. 
   Vehicles were created and enlivened. And thus, the new 
   consciousnesses of the Universe was born.
  </P>
  <P>
   As with any new addition, the proud parents took a great interest and 
   devoted a great deal of attention to the new lives that they had 
   created. They watched over them, assisted them and guided them as 
   much as possible. And the conditions that were created would be 
   referred to in your culture as paradise or utopia; all was perfect.
  </P>
  <P>
   And most of the elders watched on in approval. However, a new 
   variable entered into the picture; one of the elders of the SEVENTH 
   RAY energy frequency had been altered during the transformation of 
   the previous Universe. This alteration could be classified as a form 
   of insanity. This entity became obsessed with power and began to look 
   upon himself as a God. However, he was very skillful in shielding 
   this from the rest of the elders; he used his SEVENTH RAY energies 
   quite effectively.
  </P>
  <P>
   So he decided that as a God he should be worshipped and he needed 
   worshipers. So he descended amongst the children of the new levels 
   and began to influence them to the best of his capabilities, which 
   were massive. His primary goal was to establish himself as an object 
   of worship and to turn the children against their creators. This he 
   began to do.
  </P>
  <P>
   So clever was his illusions that many other groups of enlivened 
   spirits were introduced into the system before his deception was 
   discovered. Not all fell victim to his games but a percentage did. 
   And in a sense, it was like a disease that a minority were 
   susceptible to. And over a period of time, he established a group of 
   followers or, I should say, servants. He established himself as 
   &quot;THE&quot; supreme being and charted out his kingdom.
  </P>
  <P>
   He represented involution, regression, inertia, because he did not 
   want his servants to have the opportunity to become better than 
   himself. And he trained them to be worthless in their own opinions 
   and to do his bidding without question and without thought. And he 
   spawned within them greed, envy and all of the traits that he had 
   himself acquired for he knew by doing this they would never in mass 
   rise up against him and his power base would be insurmountable.
  </P>
  <P>
   At the same time this entity worked to influence members of the 
   SECOND LIFE WAVE, again using all his talents at illusion and 
   deception. His primary task with that group was division and 
   dissension; to turn each unit against the whole; to make the machine self-destruct.
  </P>
  <P>
   And as the spiritual time passed, he amassed a number of followers 
   and he'd planted the seeds of dissension and disharmony within the 
   Creators so that they did not function as efficiently as they had in 
   the beginning. Fortunately by this time, the majority of the creation 
   process had been completed.
  </P>
  <P>
   He had waited to make his move until territory had been created that 
   he could claim for his own and he staked out all of the ASTRAL PLANE 
   as his domain.
  </P>
  <P>
   With the problems, or thinking problems, that this entity had, he had 
   difficulty perceiving objectively or assessing objectively and he was 
   believing his own propaganda. And he thought he grew stronger by 
   those of the children that followed his bidding and that the Creators 
   grew weaker by the dissension that he had interjected into their 
   midst. It reached the point where he felt it safe to declare himself; 
   to, among his peers, stake the claim of being &quot;THE&quot; supreme 
   being and this he attempted to do. However, his power was 
   insufficient against the united group of elders. Their combined 
   powers or energies far surpassed his own. And so, he was neutralized; 
   put into suspension if you will. However, by this time the damage had 
   been done.
  </P>
  <P>
   Without a specific leader, his servants vied amongst themselves for 
   positions of leadership. They began to aggress against each other and 
   against those of the children that were not infected. They worked to 
   spread their poison throughout the entire system.
  </P>
  <P>
   It, of course, would have been possible for the creators to destroy 
   that which they had created. But this was a difficult thing to do; to 
   destroy your children. If you would contemplate that. All these 
   consciousness vehicles that were created were as a part of the 
   creators. And so it was decided that a new procedure needed to be 
   implemented; an isolation ward created so that this infection could 
   be checked. It was decided that since this infection was inherently 
   limiting, regressive and involutionary that the filter to catch the 
   infected ones needed to be at a lower level than that which existed. 
   And that these infected ones, due to their nature, would more readily 
   sink into the physical.
  </P>
  <P>
   It was by no means perfect and not all of them sank but, all in all, 
   the plan worked and thus was born the PHYSICAL PLANE and the solar 
   system you now refer to as centered around Sol with earth as the 
   third planet.
  </P>
  <P>
   Of necessity we have been brief. The events that we have described 
   this evening took a great deal of what you classify as earth time. 
   And it would not be possible to give you a reasonable figure of how 
   much or how many twenty-four hour periods elapsed. Also we have been 
   brief about the dissension concerning the Creators. However, this 
   myth has been brought down in other cultures and other religions that 
   refers to the discord in heaven and the casting out of Satan, which 
   that is not his name by the way, but it shall suffice so that your 
   consciousnesses can understand.
  </P>
  <P>
   We shall end on that note this evening and ask that you not draw any 
   conclusions or interpretations for insufficient data has been given 
   on the make up of the PHYSICAL PLANE at this point. The important 
   points of the transmission tonight are that this injured entity did 
   create a problem. He spread qualities that certain of the children 
   were susceptible [to] and they in turn, when he was neutralized, 
   began to create problems on their own and aggress against those that 
   were not infected.
  </P>
  <P>
   So our area of quarantine was created to capture and attempt to 
   rehabilitate these infected entities. And that shall be the next part 
   of our tale of the make-up of mankind.
  </P>
  <P>
   My blessings to each and every one of you. Continue to seek wisdom; 
   continue on the path back to the <B>SOURCE</B>.
  </P>
  <P>
   Good evening
