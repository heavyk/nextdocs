Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is most remembered as the creator of Sherlock 
   Holmes. What few people of today realize is that Doyle was an expert 
   psychic researcher who championed the cause of Life-After-Death.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Doyle was born in the year 1859 of Irish parentage in Edinburgh. He 
   was educated at Stonyhurst, in Germany, and studied medicine at 
   Edinburgh. Dr. Doyle served his country as a surgeon in the British 
   military during the South African war. Upon returning to civilian 
   life, he opened up his medical practice.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Dr. Doyle turned to writing to supplement his income because his 
   medical practice was not supporting him. Dr. Doyle became so 
   successful at it that he gave up medicine and became a full time 
   writer. Doyle was a most prolific writer. In addition to the Sherlock 
   Holmes stories he wrote many historical romance novels such as 
   &quot;Micah Clarke&quot;, &quot;The White Company&quot;, 
   &quot;Brigadier Gerard&quot;, &quot;Sir Nigel&quot; and &quot;Rodney 
   Stone&quot;. &quot;The Lost World&quot; and &quot;The Poison 
   Belt&quot; were science fiction stories. He also had regular articles 
   in many newspapers such as the London Times.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   His first introduction to the psychic took place while he was a 
   physician at Southsea. Between 1885-88 he was invited to take part in 
   table turning seances at the house of a patient, General Drayson. 
   Table tipping was quite popular at this time and since Drayson was a 
   teacher in the Greenwich Naval College, a keen mathematician and a 
   man of scholarly education, Doyle decided to participate. Through the 
   mediumship of a railway signalman apports were produced. However, 
   Doyle simply could not believe the phenomenon was genuine and he 
   secretly doubted the honesty of the medium. But his intellectual 
   interest was aroused and he wanted answers. He joined the Society for 
   Psychical Research and carried out a series of experiments in 
   telepathy with a Mrs. Ball, satisfying himself that this phenomenon 
   was genuine. By 1920 he still had not arrived at a definite 
   conclusion on the major issue of psychic research, life after death.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   He continued his studies for thirty years, before, on the summit of 
   his literary fame and at the age of 58, he publicly allied himself 
   with the cause of Spiritualism by the publication of &quot;The New 
   Revelation&quot; and &quot;The Vital Message&quot;. The critics 
   charge that his public announcement was attributable to his 
   bereavement suffered during World War I was unfounded. Referring to 
   it in his &quot;History of Spiritualism&quot; Conan Doyle readily 
   admits that &quot;the sight of a world which was distraught with 
   sorrow, and which he had so long pursued, were of immense practical 
   importance and could no longer be regarded as a mere intellectual 
   hobby or fascinating pursuit of a novel research. It was this 
   realization which, from early in 1916, caused him and his wife to 
   devote themselves largely to this subject (Life-After-Death or 
   Spiritualism), to lecture upon it in many countries, and to travel to 
   Australia, New Zealand, America and Canada upon missions of instruction.&quot;
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   &quot;As to the charge of credulity,&quot; he declared further on, 
   &quot;which is invariably directed by the unreceptive against anyone 
   who forms a positive opinion upon this subject, the author can 
   solemnly aver that in the course of his long career as an 
   investigator, he cannot recall one single case where it was clearly 
   shown that he had been mistaken upon any serious point, or had given 
   a certificate of honesty to a performance which was afterwards 
   clearly proved to be dishonest. A man who is credulous does not take 
   twenty years of reading and experiment before he comes to his fixed conclusions.&quot;
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Doyle began his speaking tours in 1918, and visited the principal 
   cities of Great Britain first, then in 1920-21 Australia and New 
   Zealand. Early in 1922 he went to America and toured the Eastern 
   States, the following year he traveled as far as California. In 1928 
   he left for South Africa and in the autumn of the same year he 
   lectured on Spiritualism in the Northern countries of Europe.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Having taken so many years to draw his conclusions and having started 
   out so skeptically to begin with, Doyle took strong positions when 
   the area of the psychic was attacked. He stood up for William Hope, 
   the spirit-photographer at the time of the 1922 scandal in which the 
   S.P.R. was involved. He was further antagonized by society 
   representative Theodore Besterman's review of Mrs. Hack's &quot;Modern
    Miracles at Millesimo Castle&quot;, and as he believed the honor of 
   Professor E. Bozzano to have been impugned he resigned his 
   membership. The resignation widened the gulf between the S.P.R. and 
   the Spiritualists as other members of followed Conan Doyle.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   At the International Spiritualist congress held in Paris in 1925 he 
   was nominated honorary president. In the same year he had a public 
   discussion in London with Sir Arthur Keith on Spiritualism and won on 
   points. He was president of the London Spiritualist Alliance when 
   Mrs. Cantlon, one of the mediums endorsed by the Alliance, was 
   charged with fortune telling. When the Alliance was assessed with 
   costs amounting to 800 pounds he voiced a vigorous protest in The 
   Times against what he considered the persecution of the 
   Spiritualists. He started a drive for the modification of the Fortune 
   Telling Act, and on July 1, 1930, led a deputation to Mr. Clynes, the 
   Home Secretary. Six days later he died.

   On July 13th a big reunion was held in the Albert Hall, London. An 
   empty chair was left for the deceased writer. Mrs. Estelle Roberts 
   asserted that she saw clairvoyantly Conan Doyle in the chair and 
   transmitted a personal message to the family which was accepted as 
   evidential. Since then numerous messages are claimed to have been 
   received from him through various mediums. Perhaps the most 
   noteworthy one was discussed by Harry Price in the January 1931 issue 
   of the Nash Magazine under the title &quot;The Return of Conan 
   Doyle.&quot; The medium was Mrs. Garrett. The conversation between 
   Harry Price and the spirit of Conan Doyle had many striking features. 
   The majority of this session is reproduced in John G. Fuller's 
   &quot;The Airman Who Would Not Die&quot;. This book is available in 
   paperback and is highly recommended for it is one of the best 
   documented cases for Life-After-Death.

   Psychic books by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle: &quot;The New 
   Revelation&quot; (1918); &quot;The Vital Message&quot; (1919); 
   &quot;Wanderings of a Spiritualist&quot; (1921); &quot;The Coming of 
   the Fairies&quot; (1922); &quot;Our American Adventure&quot; (1923); 
   &quot;Our Second American Adventure&quot; (1923); &quot;Memories and 
   Adventure&quot; (1924); &quot;Spiritualists' Reader &quot; (1924); 
   &quot;The Land of Mist&quot; (1916); &quot;History of 
   Spiritualism&quot; (1926); &quot;The Case for Spirit Photography&quot;
    (1924); &quot;Pheneas Speaks&quot; (1927); &quot;Our African 
   Winter&quot; (1929); &quot;The Edge of the Unknown&quot; (1930). I 
   recommend any of these books. Sir Arthur approached the subject of 
   the psychic in an objective, intelligent, and honest manner. I 
   believe all of these books are out of print but can be obtained 
   through your local used and rare book store for a price that is 
   usually less than that of a new book.<br>&nbsp;</P>
