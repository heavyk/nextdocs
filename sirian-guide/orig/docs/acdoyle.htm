   <FONT SIZE=4>AN INTRODUCTION TO SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   Presented By Sir Arthur Via A Medium In 1983
  </P>
  <P>
   [EDITOR'S NOTE: THIS INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED THROUGH AUTOMATIC 
   WRITING BY A MEDIUM. IT WAS PRESENTED IN THE FALL 1983 EDITION OF THE 
   SPHERE NEWSLETTER (NO LONGER IN PUBLICATION). IT IS PRESENTED JUST AS 
   IT WAS WRITTEN. SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, BEST KNOWN FOR SHERLOCK 
   HOLMES, WAS AN AVID SPIRITUALIST AND DEVOTED MOST OF HIS ADULT LIFE 
   TO SPIRITUAL PURSUITS. AN OVERVIEW OF SIR ARTHUR'S SPIRITUALIST WORK 
   IS PRESENTED IN JOHN G. FULLER'S, THE AIRMEN WHO WOULD NOT DIE, 
   PUBLISHED IN 1978. THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST MODERN PRESENTATION OF 
   LIFE AFTER DEATH THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN.
  </P>
  <P>
   I HOPE YOU ENJOY SIR ARTHUR'S MESSAGE]

   (In this issue, we have a guest editorialist. If you can't accept the 
   source of this information, ignore it and read the words for they are 
   timely and offer hope for the future.)
  </P>
  <P>
   I bid you greetings and would like to introduce myself. I am Arthur 
   Conan Doyle and I am quite pleased at the opportunity to get into 
   print again. Of course, since I died on July 7, 1930 it must be 
   stated that I am a genuine Ghost writer. But since some of my best 
   friends are ghosts, I suppose that is all right.
  </P>
  <P>
   Now to the business at hand, we here on the &quot;other side&quot; 
   are quite concerned at the state of affairs existent in the world 
   today. We have worked long and hard to point out the dangers that 
   portend for the future, but still many of you are not listening. And 
   herein lies the danger. Many people must hear and accept the 
   spiritual truths to avert the disasters that are looming on the 
   astral plane. Open your MINDS and your hearts. Pay heed to your 
   Subconscious, be quiet and listen to the voice within.
  </P>
  <P>
   Those of you who are reading this message have probably had an 
   interest in the psychic for some time. But I say to you now that it 
   requires more than an interest, the spiritual needs of mankind are 
   wanting and I charge each of you with a mission; you must spread the 
   spiritual truths to your fellow man despite the fact that some will 
   not listen. For now, the many will listen because they are ready. And 
   you are ready. Put fears aside. Do indeed know that there is a 
   greater existence beyond the present one. I am living proof, so to 
   speak, of this fact. In my life, as the editor was so kind to include 
   in the Profiles section, I was skeptical for many years. Being a 
   practical man, I could not believe that something as wonderful as 
   spirit actually existed. And lord knows there were more than a few to 
   affirm this notion. But as time passed, I began to see more, and I 
   had to put aside my pragmatism and accept that which logic denied, 
   the existence of spirit. And my friends, so must you. There are few 
   things in life that are certain, and death is one of them. Ignorance 
   of death is counterproductive.
  </P>
  <P>
   I give thanks to my channel for allowing me to write these words. I 
   will come again from time to time for it is my mission also to 
   educate people to spirit.
  </P>
  <P>
   Yours faithfully,
  </P>
  <P>
   A. Conan Doyle
