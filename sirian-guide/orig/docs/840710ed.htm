   <FONT SIZE=3>The emotions and the concrete thought's have been 
   flitting and zooming in what can be described as chaos. Each has been 
   affected by this in his or her own way. And we wish that such a storm 
   did not have to be endured by such fine entities as yourselves. 
   However, with each great step forward, with each change, with each 
   major accomplishment on the physical plane, such storms are quite 
   common and characteristic of this planet of which you are a part. You 
   can look back in your history and see that such turmoil, such soul 
   searching if you will, has always been characteristic of a great 
   stride forward.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We know that each of you are interested for your various 
   reasons in the saga that we are relating to you of how mankind came 
   to be. However, this evening we shall forego a continuation for we 
   need to do an exercise that will be of much benefit. And that 
   exercise is consciously linking each other with the energy of love; 
   joining together and bringing each as one.</FONT>

   <FONT SIZE=3>And so what we would have you do is to focus your 
   attention on your heart centers. And now see the center in your mind 
   as a brilliant dark blue circle and see it rotating on top of you in 
   a clock-wise manner.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Now starting with myself, I shall form a connection to 
   the person to my right at their heart center. When I have completed 
   my connection I shall say so by acknowledging:&quot;COMPLETED&quot; 
   and then the person to my right shall do the same thing until we have 
   made a completed circle and then we shall bask in the energy of 
   oneness, and love, and peace, and allow it to settle our raw 
   emotional and turbulent concrete minds. I shall begin the process now.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>....&quot;COMPLETED&quot;.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>....There appears to be a break in the chain, if so, the 
   person to the immediate right can connect to that person and then 
   connect to the other side to continue the chain. When you have gotten 
   both connections obtained please acknowledge: &quot;COMPLETED&quot;.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>OK, now feel this energy circulate in a counter clock 
   wise manner. In other words out of your right making a full circle. 
   And as it rotates, allow it to cleanse and purify your troubled 
   spirits; let it wash away hurt; pain; suffering; the negative 
   thoughts; the limiting thoughts that are so prevalent at this point. 
   And with it, circulate the thought that we are one and allow yourself 
   to join as one.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Open your minds and your hearts; allow the energy, and 
   the love, and the peace to surge through your system. All are one and 
   one is all.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This union is the closest that one on the physical plane 
   can attain to the Source and is a very powerful union.</FONT>
  </P>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>My blessings upon each and everyone of you; go in peace 
   and walk the path that you have chosen; the path that you know in 
   your heart is the one that you must take. We shall help as advisors 
   but we cannot do it for you. You are on the physical plane, we can 
   only say that in unity you have strength and the ability to 
   accomplish; separate, your effectiveness is impaired.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We love each and everyone of you and we are happy that 
   some of you are working and overcoming the internal hardships to 
   become that which you are for only in so doing shall the purpose be 
   done. And my blessings is upon each and everyone of you on the path 
   that you have chosen.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Those of you that walk with us, walk in unity; walk in 
   love; walk in peace. And those of you who choose to go astray, you 
   still have our love; you still have our blessings. We appreciate the 
   help for it is needed to complete the purpose that began ages past. 
   Let the love enter into your hearts; into your beings and let the 
   light of true discovery of self shine and dispel the darkness and the 
   corruption of the physical plane. Work together; join together as one 
   and you shall succeed beyond your wildest expectations. The path may 
   seem the most difficult to tread, but at the end of this existence 
   you will find that it was by far the easiest and the most rewarding.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>To my children I say bless you; keep striving. To my 
   colleagues I say overcome the past do not let the physical plane beat 
   you down; unite as one and see through the purpose to which we agreed 
   so long ago. You may disconnect the heart centers now; go in peace; 
   go in love and we wish all the best for you on the physical plane, 
   whatever brings you happiness.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We shall return again and continue our saga of creation. 
   We hope that you find it of interest, but leave it up to your 
   individual consciousnesses as to how to assimilate it into your daily lives.</FONT>

   <FONT SIZE=3>Blessings upon all.</FONT>
