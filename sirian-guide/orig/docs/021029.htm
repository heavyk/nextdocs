   <FONT SIZE=3>[Editor's Note: this precognitive dream was presented to 
   me by the author on the afternoon of September 11, 2001.]</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The night of September 10, 2001, I had this dream: I am 
   standing in front of a large window, many stories above the ground. I 
   am basking in the beautiful blue sky, the brilliant sunshine. In the 
   distance I see a plane approaching, and I casually think that the 
   plane seems to be flying awfully low. I continue to watch it. With a 
   growing sense of horror, I realize that the plane is going to hit the 
   window I am standing in front of. I turn to run, knowing I will not 
   make it. The last segment of the dream is a total and complete blackout.</FONT><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The next morning, September 11, 2001, I rose and went to 
   work just like everyone else did. I did not recall the dream at that 
   time. At 8:30 AM, I went into a meeting. At 9:30 AM, the Executive 
   Director of my company came in and solemnly announced that terrorists 
   had crashed two planes into the World Trade Centers in New York. 
   Thousands were missing and suspected dead. Everyone sat in stunned 
   silence for a few minutes, then several women started to cry. A few 
   of the men stood up and angrily demanded to know why, and how. 
   Finally everyone simply drifted out of the room, dazed and horrified.</FONT><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>I went back to my office, not yet remembering the dream 
   I had had just hours before. I sat at my desk and listened to the 
   radio, to the sounds of anguished reporters talking about what was 
   happening around New York, Washington, and a remote field in 
   Pennsylvania. For the rest of the day I sat and stared at the white 
   wall in front of me, steeped in despair. Coworkers wandered in from 
   time to time, shaking their heads. Secretaries wept, grown men in 
   business suits embraced in the hallways. It was a day of unfathomable grief.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It wasn't until I got home that night that I remembered 
   my dream. The realization of what I had foreseen caused me to sit up 
   in bed and gasp. I had had a precognitive dream of this horrific 
   event, seemingly seen through the eyes of one of the victims. But 
   why? And why me?</FONT><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As I lay in the darkness contemplating these questions, 
   I remembered something else about my dream, something that had not 
   been so obvious prior to the events, but that now seemed like the 
   very reason I had received the dream. I went through the dream 
   sequence again- I recalled standing in front of the window and 
   watching the plane approach, slow and steady. I remembered turning to 
   run and knowing without any doubt that I would not make it. I 
   remembered the total blackout as death overtook me.</FONT><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And then I remembered what happened just prior to the 
   blackout. As I was running, knowing that I faced certain death, that 
   my moments of life on the Earth were coming to an unexpected end, 
   instead of being angry and afraid, I was infused with the most 
   profound sense of peace I have ever felt in my life. It was a peace I 
   have never experienced in my waking life. I gave myself over to that 
   peace, and it comforted me in the very moment of my death. No, I did 
   not want to die, but I was not afraid. There was no misery or fear 
   associated with it. I simply accepted it, and when that total 
   blackout came, when my consciousness evaporated to the next level, <I>that
    feeling of peace went with me</I>. It carried me through.</FONT><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>I do not presume to know what any of the victims of 
   9/11/01 went through, or felt, that day, nor do I presume to know how 
   any of their families felt, then or now. But what if one of the 
   victims in the World Trade Center gave this dream as a last gift, a 
   last offering, a message to be passed to those of us left behind 
   after his or her death; that no matter the circumstances, death is 
   not something to be feared; rather , the experience of death can be 
   one of the most profound and peaceful events of our lives. Who of us 
   still on the physical plane is qualified to carry this message? Only 
   someone who has already passed over, or who was about to pass over, 
   would be able to deliver this message of hope.</FONT><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>I can only pray that in the moment of my death, I will 
   feel the same sense of peace that this brave entity did. And I am so 
   grateful that he or she chose to leave behind this message of love 
   and hope in the midst of all that suffering, all that anguish.</FONT><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>What a beautiful legacy.</FONT>
