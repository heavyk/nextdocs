   <FONT SIZE=4>RAY RELATIONSHIPS</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We have given you only the barest essentials in the 
   description of the individuals that make up the ancient Atlantean 
   Pantheon. The best way to learn about a person's character is to 
   watch him in action. We cannot recreate the past so that you may 
   watch it as on a movie screen but we can give you the key 
   characteristics (the how and why) of the relation of these entities. 
   While you are reading about them, you will learn much about how the 
   different rays relate to each other and the problems inherent in 
   personifying each one onto the physical. This will reveal to you what 
   each ray type should watch out for as potential problem areas.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>..... The FIRST RAY deals with wholes and universals; 
   the THIRD RAY - being MANAS - divides; deals with the empirical and 
   actualizes intellect. The SECOND RAY relates the two to each other as 
   well as to the resultant of their interaction.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The FIRST RAY is at home and comfortable dealing with 
   totalities whereas a whole appears to a THIRD RAY as a jumble of 
   chaos; chaos being a state without applied mental organization and 
   form as a logical result. The THIRD RAY takes things apart and gains 
   understanding by laboriously analyzing each particle right down to 
   the last divisible part. The SECOND RAY is more interested in how the 
   parts of a thing relate to the whole thing.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Here is an example of the interaction between the three. 
   The FIRST RAY tells the THIRD RAY, &quot;You cannot know a tree or 
   any <B>thing</B> by analyzing its atoms. The whole is greater and 
   different than the sum of its parts.&quot;</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The THIRD RAY quickly responds, &quot;The so-called <B>whole</B> 
   is no more than the aggregate atoms in specialized functioning.&quot;</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The FIRST RAY condescendingly replies, &quot;You are 
   referring to its body and the body is not the <B>thing</B> in itself.&quot;</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>THIRD RAY getting impatient with what is obviously an 
   illogical mystic or weirdo sneers, &quot;Show me this<B> thing</B> in 
   itself! I'd love to analyze it! Then I'll believe you.&quot;</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>By this time the SECOND RAY seeing this needless 
   argument about to take place between his two friends, burst in, 
   patting each on the back, &quot;Friends, come now, I'll show you how 
   you are both right and both wrong.&quot;</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Off we go again&quot;, says the THIRD RAY giving 
   FIRST RAY an exaggerated look of exasperation.&quot;</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't have time for your double-talk,&quot; says 
   FIRST RAY, typical of their diplomatic style. (Example of FIRST RAY diplomacy)</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>But SECOND RAY is such a warm, radiate and positive 
   person that it is difficult not to stay and listen, even for the 
   FIRST RAY.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You, FIRST RAY, say that the life (that which 
   informs and animates the form) and the intangible are more real and 
   important than the parts that make up the body/form); and true that 
   which incorporates into its functioning greater and greater schemes 
   of complexity usually, by necessity, is further evolved than those 
   systems which have been subjugated to the benefit of the greater whole.&quot;</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>&quot;On the other hand, THIRD RAY, you say that the 
   parts are all there is because you can see, take apart, put together 
   or in some way quantify them into one of your cerebral categories. 
   And it is indeed true that the form is composed of parts.&quot;</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>&quot;However, you glorify that which the mind can play 
   its games with. If a phenomena fits into the boundaries of your 
   preexisting mental constructs - you say its real and is a rational 
   supposition. Yet, THIRD RAY, you cannot show me a thought; that very 
   thing that you glorify. You cannot objectify it in any way to 
   analyze. Do you deny their existence? If so, you have proved nothing 
   by all your mental gymnastics of analysis.&quot;</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If on the other hand, there were no forms for life 
   to inhabit, there would be no progress of evolution. I say you're 
   both missing the point!&quot;</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The SECOND RAY pauses to breathe in and fill himself 
   with the inspiration he feels coming on.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I just bet you're going to tell us what the real 
   point is, aren't you? says FIRST RAY, getting itchy to get back to 
   work and making moves in that direction.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The important aspect is not the higher or the 
   lower as separate <B>things</B>, but how they ever get together into 
   a meaningful relationship. Better still, that which relates the two 
   is the prime factor and the essence of existent being. Your 
   scientists&quot;, SECOND RAY points to THIRD RAY who stands with 
   folded arms and an amused look on his face, &quot;should be analyzing 
   and delineating, for the good of all sensuous and developed or latent 
   conscious beings, this <B>Science of Relating</B>.&quot;</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>SECOND RAY was clearly gathering steam. Several more of 
   the lab personnel had collected around him with clearly admiring and 
   intrigued expressions. THIRD RAY chuckled and walked away. He had 
   seen SECOND RAY perform before. FIRST RAY had long since gone back to 
   work and was, by now, oblivious to the growing crowd around SECOND 
   RAY in a corner of the lab.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>SECOND RAY continued to grow in energetic radiation 
   directly proportional to the size of the group that collected around 
   him and the amount of admiration and enthusiasm they showed for him 
   and his fledgling idea. His continued elocution refined his seed idea 
   until it developed into a GREAT method for people to Relate their 
   higher and lower selves into a consciously working, cooperating 
   whole. This GREAT RELATION, as he called it, you may have heard of or 
   at least what it has become - Religion.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We did not include the four attributes, the FOURTH, 
   FIFTH, SIXTH and SEVENTH RAYS, in the preceding dialogue for they are 
   specializations of the THIRD RAY and react similarly to it with 
   exception of the SIXTH RAY which vibrates in harmony with the SECOND 
   therefore reacting similarly to the SECOND.</FONT>

  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Remember our Cast:</FONT>

   <FONT SIZE=3>-1 Anatau</FONT>
  </P>

  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>-5+ Vulcrum</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In order for us to show you how these entities relate 
   and work together, we will have to go further back than 75,000 B.C., 
   long before the beginning of the decline of Atlantis.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Any time that a small group of entities, such as this 
   one, work together for eons, there will develop patterns of 
   interaction and close ties. Camaraderie and love of each member for 
   the other was strong. They were a family of specialized Gods. Their 
   devotion to each other and their purpose was, and is, unequaled in 
   humun history.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Our SECOND RAYS are always busy relating, whether it be 
   relating people to people, ideas to ideas, or people to ideas; they 
   are gathering together and nourishing. In the lesser evolved, this 
   characteristic can make for an expert busy body. They make superb 
   diplomats and social butterflies. Where ever you find them they will 
   be genuinely concerned about everyone's welfare - body, mind and spirit.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Our THIRD RAYS are very much into creating ever 
   increasingly complex systems of organization and methods whereby they 
   can be administered. These complex institutions, or organisms, are 
   designed by them to serve the purpose of the group at the time and to 
   make sure that their created forms, laws and rituals not be vitiated. 
   Whether it be a business institution, a branch of government, a 
   judicial system or the best way to perform a religious rite; our 
   THIRD RAYS will organize, administer, and regulate it. Naturally, it 
   would follow that law, order of the law and periodicity are big on 
   their list of interests.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Our FIRST RAY (for one is all that can usually be 
   tolerated) is always consumed with perfecting one job after another 
   so that the overall purpose can be brought about as fast as possible 
   and be in a state of perfection. Work is their only play and you will 
   find their main interest lies in the manipulation of energy. They 
   enjoy making things live, disintegrating and rearranging patterns of 
   energy to facilitate evolution. To them everything is divine and has 
   life, therefore they think nothing of destroying forms.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Isis is a radiate, kind, gentle, caring and genuinely 
   concerned person. She makes a great hostess and guest.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Unessa would organize social or political functions and 
   arrange for Isis to serve as hostess and Genxicat to entertain. (You 
   will notice that Anatau was left out. She attended nothing outside of 
   her lab unless Sanatau demanded it for social gatherings were a waste 
   of time .....)</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Isis was loved, Unessa was admired, Genxicat was desired 
   and Anatau was feared.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Being male grounds as Sanatau, Osiris, Dwul Quin and 
   Vulcrum are, causes these entities to be less flamboyant than they 
   could have been. This is particularly the case for Osiris. This group 
   of males were and are the solid foundation that kept the group entity 
   alive, vital and uncorrupted.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The ground is a very important person to the female of 
   the triad. Therefore, a very long standing and seemingly stable 
   relationship existed between each female and her ground. That is why 
   Osiris was so important to Isis in the legends. This necessitated the 
   grounding male to stay in general proximity to the female, whereas 
   the other male of the triads could and did freely hop around the 
   universe. The female and the ground kept the foundation secure and 
   the energy flowing for the other male to accomplish that which was 
   the purpose.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Due to the closeness of Isis and Osiris, Ra was able to 
   carry out diplomatic schemes with Jeortau all over the Universe. 
   (Although we have not mentioned the fact, this group was not only 
   involved in the planet earth but the whole of creation. This has 
   probably become apparent to you by now.)</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Osiris, being SIXTH RAY, found being a grounding agent 
   very confining to his ray nature. He would be pulled away from his 
   power base, Isis, occasionally by his natural need to be relating and 
   helpful to people. If he were engrossed in physical matter, this 
   would be his undoing. He would be pulled apart by conflict between 
   his ray type and his position. However, being enclosed in the matter 
   from his own system, this was not an insurmountable problem.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>SECOND RAY males like to be radiated onto by females and 
   the females like to radiate upon them, therefore Isis and Jeortau got 
   along well.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Dwul Quinn is Unessa's grounding agent which added to 
   Quinn's more than somber nature and also accounts for the legends of 
   the beautiful Venus being married to the ugliest god.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This left Tahuti free to gad around teaching and 
   impressing humanity with his art and craft, which he did with 
   enjoyment. He also accompanied Ra and Jeortau on some of their 
   diplomatic tours.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Vulcrum was the ground for Genxicat. He too was a solemn 
   individual although he was very tolerant of everyone outside of his 
   lab. Vulcrum and Anatau worked well together. Both were 
   perfectionists and workaholics, although for different reasons. 
   Schekamet's reason was to accomplish the purpose and Vulcrum simply 
   loved making the things she would come up with. Vulcrum would 
   frequently accompany Anatau on a short junket within the galaxy, that 
   is, when she could sneak away from Sanatau.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Allayandra was left free to be the Protector of the 
   Purpose. He often went with Jeortau, Ra and Tahuti on their 
   &quot;diplomatic excursions&quot;. Just how diplomatic these tours 
   were was the subject of many group jokes and produced a notoriety for 
   them throughout the Universe. Being a SEVENTH RAY warrior, he also 
   worked with Anatau. Within her energy domain, he could wield her 
   energy as if he were a FIRST RAY male. Allayandra loved Venus; these 
   stories are still around in the form of Mars and Venus.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Within this system, the females were the true warriors, 
   and if things got very bad they were called out. If it was not a 
   major issue, the females were protected. In situations of the worst 
   possible enemy confrontation, Anatau was sent for. She would respond 
   with alacrity for she enjoyed throwing powerful bursts of energy. But 
   she had a habit of destroying everything and Sanatau would have to 
   call her off. You can read about this in the stories of Sckmet of 
   Memphis wherein she almost destroyed all humunkind.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The THIRD RAY, being concerned with mental action does 
   not respond with as much ardor, enthusiasm or interest to 
   relationships with the opposite sex. This causes difficulty with 
   their relationships within a SECOND RAY system or with a SECOND RAY 
   of the opposite sex.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>SECOND RAYs enjoy the game of socializing, courtship 
   (interplay between charges) and the intensity of their feelings 
   within their often infatuations. They are willing to spend much time 
   and emotional energy on their relationships whereas the THIRD RAY 
   would rather approach the matter logically, cutting through all the 
   extraneous courtship to get to the reason for the relationship.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>FIRST RAYs care almost nothing for relationships between 
   the sexes. They have nothing against sex; it simply takes up too much 
   time that could be spent much more interestingly, such as working or warring.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>A SEVENTH RAY does enjoy playing around creating 
   illusions within the framework of a sexual relationship but this can 
   become a problem for them for as with everything with a SEVENTH RAY, 
   they may confuse the real and the illusion; they may begin to believe 
   their own illusion or they may decide that nothing is real. This then 
   is their major problem within the physical.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This became the problem for Genxicat as she approached 
   grosser physical matter in the later days of Atlantis. She began to 
   have anxiety attacks concerning her identity. She could be anything 
   or all things to anyone but who she was to herself became a major 
   concern to her. Also, if people liked what she appeared to them to 
   be, did anyone like her for her real self? The fact that she had no 
   definite physical form contributed heavily to this problem of 
   identity. She was withdrawn shortly after the FIRST RAY triad.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Allayandra was fiery, elegant and a smooth talker. 
   Anatau was his sister. SECOND RAYs were a bit too sincere for his 
   taste; Genxicat competed to see who could create the best illusion 
   but elegant Unessa was just right except she wasn't easy to move with 
   fast talk or illusions. Oh well, there was the whole galaxy to pick 
   from, he thought!</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Dwul Quinn was such a somber creature that it obviously 
   evoked the maternal instinct within all the females. They all liked 
   him including Anatau. He didn't seem to mind but accepted their 
   attention and companionship as if it were his due.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The RAYs have their inherent problems under adverse 
   conditions. The THIRD RAY, when organization and form are squalled, 
   can be thrown into complete indecision and inaction.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Under continuing adversity and suppression, the SECOND 
   RAY can learn to enjoy depression.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And of course the FIRST RAY wants to destroy the whole 
   mess and start over - frequently!</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The SECOND RAY has within its equipment the active 
   intelligence of the THIRD RAY. The FIRST RAY has within its equipment 
   the quality of love and active intelligence, all of which is powered 
   by the relentless pursuit of purpose. This means that the FIRST RAY 
   has all the assets and liabilities of the other two. The quest of 
   mental pursuits is strong within them; so is the desire of and for 
   love but the THIRD RAY attribute harmonizes with the FIRST RAY better 
   and is more useful in the pursuit of the purpose so the FIRST RAY 
   hides and even tries to deny all of the SECOND RAY qualities. Of 
   course, this does not work and creates conflict within.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The whole of the FIRST RAY triad is influenced by this 
   inner battle. Most overtly affected is Jeortau, a beautiful creature, 
   powerfully driven toward his goal of cosmic Quin; yet he is inwardly 
   haunted by the need to be loved, to socialize as other SECOND RAYs 
   and to be admired for his sacrificial role. He is a dove of peace and 
   beauty at war with his desires and purpose. Actually, he was the most 
   admired, appreciated and loved for the work he did cosmically by the 
   whole of this galaxy; but was never able to accept it as being good enough.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Sanatau was the oldest member of the whole group and 
   Anatau was the youngest. Sanatau, as elder to the group and grounding 
   agent for Anatau, had to be as solid and unmoveable in judgment as 
   granite. He had to ride herd on his volatile and rebellious female 
   while he remained calm enough to make the right decisions for the 
   groups' organizations. This was an exacting task for some of 
   Schekamet's antics could teach granite to have a temper.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Sanatau was good friends to all the other females and 
   males. He was just in his decisions, therefore, he was a bit feared. 
   This was due partly to his position as elder, partly because he 
   grounded the energy for the whole of the group and partly because he 
   was responsible to the counsel from whence he came for the groups 
   success. He took his responsibility seriously. This caused him to be 
   almost a recluse. He lived within a mountain with Anatau and came out seldom.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Anatau, for all her fire, protest and rebellion; adored 
   her ground, Ptah's; loved her brother, Jeortau, dearly; and would 
   have gladly given herself to save any group member; but you would 
   never get her to verbally admit to any of the above.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We of the Sirian Cortege hope that this information will 
   help you in your quest for identity, help you to recognize your 
   strong points, and help you see how to make the weaker points into strengths.</FONT>

   <FONT SIZE=3>The preceding descriptions of the entities that made up 
   the Atlantean pantheon were intentional humunized. That is, we 
   pointed out the problems that would be encountered by any entity that 
   attempted to bring into the physical plane of planet Earth, in a 
   physical body contributed by that planet, unadulterated Ray Energy. 
   These entities were and are pure personifications of their Rays and 
   in the state in which they came to earth, were not subject to those 
   faults that we used to illustrate. They were perfected energy 
   manifestations and as such could not occupy what you would call 
   physical matter.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Millions of years ago, they arrived on Earth for the 
   first of many periodic visits and began a careful process of genetic 
   manipulation of life. They shortly set up a permanent base within a 
   mountain range which remains secret to the present.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When munkind began the process of developing the 
   CONCRETE MIND, these entities had to withdraw from their presence. In 
   order to further assist munkind, these entities attempted to step 
   their energy down into more physical type vehicles but this allowed 
   problems to crop up. Finally, they completely withdrew themselves. 
   Occasionally, after the sinking of Atlantis, one of these entities 
   would overshadow an already advanced entity that was in physical 
   incarnation and would cooperate with them.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>At the time of the sinking of Atlantis, munkind had 
   rejected their pantheon and the teachings given out by this group. 
   Subsequently, Mun has lost all records as to the fact that munkind 
   was manipulated into being by these alien creatures. Munkind has 
   rejected his alien and divine ancestry. Therefore this pantheon 
   retreated to await the time that they would be called upon. They left 
   a method whereby a mun could contact their energies and qualities 
   within the mystery schools; although that has been lost now for over 
   a thousand years.....</FONT>
