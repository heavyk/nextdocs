  </P>
  <P>
   I had an experience two or three years ago, I don't remember the time 
   exactly but I will never forget the experience, involving a SILVER 
   SPHERE approximately 6 inches in diameter.
  </P>
  <P>
   I had gone to bed while my wife remained in the living room watching 
   television. In the bedroom, there is a small desk lamp that is kept 
   on all the time as a night light.
  </P>
  <P>
   I was asleep when I felt the bottom of my right foot, just below the 
   toes, sharply bumped. It startled me and I opened my eyes towards my 
   feet. There, bobbing in the air was a SILVER SPHERE, approximately 
   six inches in diameter. Now this was not a chrome silver, but more of 
   a dull, brushed silver color. When I made eye contact with it, it 
   backed away slowly and bobbed about three feet from the end of the 
   bed. As I gazed at it, it slowly, and I mean slowly, faded away.
  </P>
  <P>
   Believe it or not, I did not think too much of this as I have, since 
   childhood, awakened and seen strange things that faded away as I 
   became more conscious. So, I assumed that this was just another of 
   uncountable wake up and see something strange experiences.
  </P>
  <P>
   I closed my eyes and went back to sleep. I was abruptly awakened by 
   an electric like shock to my right foot. I looked at the foot of the 
   bed and again saw the SILVER SPHERE bobbing in the air and slowly 
   backing away as I made eye contact. Again I watched it until it faded 
   away. Now this is strange, I thought to myself. I had never had a 
   rerun of seeing the same object upon waking up. Also, I couldn't 
   recall being physically affected by the strange things I had 
   sometimes seen upon awakening over the years.
  </P>
  <P>
   Still, after years of such experiences, I didn't give it much 
   thought. I laid back down and tried to go to sleep. Shortly, I 
   received a super shock on the bottom of my right foot. Again, I found 
   myself looking at this SILVER SPHERE as it bobbed at the foot of the 
   bed. It again backed away about three feet and I watched it until it disappeared.
  </P>
  <P>
   Well, this is different, I thought to myself. I need to tell my wife 
   about this.
  </P>
  <P>
   With great difficulty, I got out of bed and walked to the living room 
   where my wife was still watching television. I stood at the doorway 
   and discovered that my mouth wouldn't work and my thoughts were 
   fuzzy. So, I decided to go to the kitchen to get a drink of water 
   which I did. I went back to the living room and still, my mouth would 
   not work, so I simply went back to bed.
  </P>
  <P>
   I still don't know what the purpose of the incident was. However, it 
   was obvious that the SILVER SPHERE was under intelligent control, it 
   wanted me to notice it and it wanted me to get up.
