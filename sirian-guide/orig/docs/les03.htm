  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>SEVEN RAYS</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Seven rays are the differentiation of <B>SOURCE</B> 
   during and for the duration of Creation.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>There are three rays of Aspect:</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>FIRST RAY</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>SECOND RAY</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>THIRD RAY</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>These form the TRIAD of creation. In fact, they are 
   prerequisite for creation to occur. Blending their energy into one 
   unit, manifestation becomes possible.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>FIRST RAY: Shakti. God the father. First aspect of the God-head.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>SECOND RAY: Vishnu. God the son. Second aspect of the 
   God-head. Office of Christ.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>THIRD RAY: Shiva. God the Holy Spirit. Third aspect of divinity.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When manifestation occurs, the third aspect rays forth 
   four attributes:</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>FOURTH RAY = balance. Harmony through conflict.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>FIFTH RAY = concrete science.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>SIXTH RAY = idealism.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>SEVENTH RAY = ceremonial order and magic.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Characteristics of the rays relative to man:</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>1st RAY = power, will, purpose, creation, destruction, monadic.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>2nd RAY = wisdom, love, consciousness.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>3rd RAY = mind, manas, intelligence in action.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>4th RAY = middle point, harmony through conflict.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>5th RAY = science, concrete mind.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>6th RAY = idealism, aspiration, devotion.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>7th RAY = order by law of cycles, ritualistic magic, 
   magic of ceremony.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>THE NATURE OF ENERGY</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>All there is, is ENERGY!</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Undifferentiated it is the one SOURCE. As the energy 
   flows from the SOURCE it is differentiated into three types:</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>1. That which gives life = 1st RAY.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>2. That which binds life = 2nd RAY.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>3. That which actuates life = 3rd RAY.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Quality relates to the condition of life in the form. 
   (2nd RAY perspective)</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>A. The state of the form (substance itself) = 3rd RAY.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>B. The state of conscious persistent expression = 2nd RAY.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>C. The resultant action of the will on form = 1st RAY.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>FURTHER DESCRIPTIONS</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>SEVENTH RAY constricts action into or to from.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>SIXTH RAY influences matter-consciousness through inspiration.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>FIFTH RAY confines form and confines conscious action 
   toward restrictive forms.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>FOURTH RAY adds harmony and balance between purpose and inertia.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>THIRD RAY deals with all action initiated by MANAS (mind principle).</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>SECOND RAY draws reactions inherent in substance into 
   self consciousness.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>FIRST RAY empowers the primordial paradigm with the 
   necessary energy to create it and sustain its functioning.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>THE THREE MAJOR RAYS</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The THIRD RAY is the grand architect of the God-head, 
   the geometrician, the great logician, formulator, and supreme 
   scientist of the heavens.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The SECOND RAY is the divine preserver, nourisher of 
   life, fanner of the flames of consciousness in all forms, binder, 
   cosmic lover, Savior of all life, the Great sacrificer, the cosmic 
   Q'in, and the Christ.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The FIRST RAY is the creator, divine will, the purpose, 
   the power; that which gives life to the forms of the THIRD RAY and 
   empowers the SECOND RAY. It is the destroyer of out grown forms.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Even though the above list is concerning the God-head or 
   TRIAD of any creation, remember the Hermes' adage &quot;as above, so 
   below.&quot; You can gain much from the analogy.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Also, how a ray is described greatly depends upon which 
   ray is viewing it. For example:</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>A first ray will view everything from the stand point of 
   purpose, power or one's will.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Second Ray - The power or purpose of love, or the will 
   to love.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Third Ray - The power or purpose of intelligence, or the 
   will to intellectualize.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Fourth Ray - The power or purpose of harmony. or will to harmonize.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Fifth Ray - The power or purpose of science, or the will 
   to manifest.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Sixth Ray - The power or purpose of ideals, or the will 
   to inspire aspiration.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Seventh Ray - The power or purpose of cyclic laws, the 
   will to order.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>SECOND RAY relates everything to love (the attraction 
   and repulsion of the bipolar system, and radiation.)</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The love of power/purpose.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The love of intellectualizing /action.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The love of harmony.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The love of manifestation.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The love of ideals.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The love of ceremonial order.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>THIRD RAY relates to forms, structures, all of which are 
   contained within the mind.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The form and order that power should follow.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The order and form that love takes.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The order and form of harmony.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The order and form of manifested mentation.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The order and form best suited to an ideal.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The order and form of ceremonial or cyclical law.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Since the third ray covers the other four, you can 
   extrapolate, from the above list for the third ray, and tell how they 
   would go.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>THE SEVENTH RAY</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It has been suggested, since the age that has just begun 
   to dawn on the earth is ruled by the SEVENTH RAY, that we give you a 
   more complete description of this ray, and possible changes that it 
   will produce shortly upon your kingdom.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Sincerely, the Sirian Group.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>OVERVIEW</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The effect of the SEVENTH RAY that is going to be most 
   felt in your era, is what the age of concrete science has falsely 
   termed MAGIC.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The last time that the SEVENTH RAY was in power or 
   incarnated was during the zenith of Atlantis.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Entities that have not reincarnated since that time have 
   begun to do so, and will continue in number.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The energy necessary to carry out MAGICAL operations has 
   not been available until this century and is still on the increase.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>THE NATURE OF THE SEVENTH RAY</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The SEVENTH RAY governs the physical plane. Its color is 
   violet. The main function of the SEVENTH RAY is to organize the form 
   to meet the needs of incarnating life. It expresses the essence of 
   the life in form. In other words, the form (which is made of matter), 
   is the artistic representation of the life inhabiting it which is 
   produced by the SEVENTH RAY.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When you look at a diamond, you are viewing the physical 
   plane representation of the indwelling life. This representation is 
   the artistic endeavor of the SEVENTH RAY related to the mineral kingdom.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Great organizations are also expressions of their work. 
   The economy and money system is SEVENTH RAY. You'll notice that about 
   the time the SEVENTH RAY manifested, the gold standard was abolished 
   and money became based on nothing - magic. You can expect some 
   radical changes within the money system of earth. For money is 
   suppose to represent concreted etheric energy, and SEVENTH RAYs deal 
   with this etheric energy. It has been termed magic because most 
   people cannot yet see on the etheric plane.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As more people develop etheric vision, life-after-death 
   of the physical vehicle will be an established fact. Also, people 
   will learn how to manipulate the etheric to produce effects that 
   would have been termed &quot;magic.&quot; The medical profession will 
   be revolutionized. So will science. Interaction between DEVAs and 
   humans will be common place again.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>THE SEVENTH RAY RELATED TO OTHER RAYS</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>1. The form and order to achieve power. The form and 
   order to uphold the purpose. The form and order to serve the will. 
   The FIRST RAY and SEVENTH RAY are closely allied. The SEVENTH forever 
   diligently working to fit the form to the purpose of the embodied life.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>2. The form and order of nourished love and wisdom.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>3. The from and order of mentation and law according to plane.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>4. The form and order for balance and harmonious 
   blending of the three aspects with the attributes.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>5. The form and order of mentation into self consciousness.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>6. The form and order for realized ideals and devotion 
   due to aspiration.</FONT>
