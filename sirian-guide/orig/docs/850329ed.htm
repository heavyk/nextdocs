  <TITLE>Life After Death: Knowledge to Dispel Fear - Part 2 By
   DjwahlKuhl (DK)</TITLE>
  <META NAME="description" CONTENT="In 1985, Djwhal Kuhl, known to many as DK, presented a series of lectures on a topic that most people would prefer not to think about...death. As he so aptly pointed out, it is an experience that everyone without exception will eventually face. The intent of these lectures was to emphasize that life is eternal and what we believe in life determines what we will experience in the afterlife. The message is clear, death is not to be feared, it is a change. It is not the end, it is a beginning.">

  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Greetings to you along the path, it is I, D.K. Tonight 
   we shall continue our discussion of life after death. When an 
   individual is approaching the time to divest themselves of the 
   physical vehicles, a set sequence of events usually occurs. The onset 
   of this process is from two to four weeks prior to the actual 
   departure. At this time the individual will become distant, 
   introspective, perhaps frightened depending on the programming of the 
   consciousness. The person will either accept or resist their 
   impending departure. During this stage, prior to the departure, an 
   actual loosening of the etheric and astral vehicles occurs from the 
   physical. The bond is weakened so that the passing over can occur. 
   Sensitive people usually are aware of this process occurring in those 
   around them. The signals are there for all to see. During this period 
   the consciousness may have dreams or flashes of the impending 
   departure. The means of departure is of little consequence. This 
   process occurs whether it be natural or assisted by elements on the 
   physical plane. The person becomes less focused in the physical, they 
   reflect upon their life. Sometimes they will discuss this with those 
   around them. In some instances the impending departure will be discussed.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When such a process is set in motion it means that the 
   natural flow of the particular physical existence has been 
   satisfactorily completed. It is a time that should be filled with joy 
   and celebration. However, in society, as it exists today, such 
   signals are perceived as distress signals by those around the entity 
   preparing to depart the physical. The entity themselves may be upset 
   at an emotional level because of this impending departure. This in 
   turn creates disruptive vibratory patterns and it has a building 
   effect on the individual and those around them. Many people ignore 
   the signals (both the entity preparing to depart and those around 
   them) but the emotional impact is usually there. Very few entities 
   depart the physical plane as a surprise because usually it is better 
   coordinated than the entry into the physical plane by most entities.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As I say, this state is an important period. It is the 
   transition period, the loosening of the physical ties and it is 
   during this four to two week period where the entity will accelerate 
   his passing through the lower planes or fixate himself there. The 
   lack of conscious knowledge, the insulation of the consciousness from 
   the inner self causes, in most instances, this transition period to 
   hinder the entity. People responding to the cues in turn, send out 
   emotional signals to the entity preparing to depart. All of it can 
   create quite an emotional or astral fixation. For those entities that 
   fear death, their fears and discomforts grow during this transitional 
   period. They find themselves longing for certain aspects of the 
   physical plane that they found desirable or pleasurable in their 
   past. Usually these things are tangible in some sense being either a 
   possession, a place or a living person. The entities rather than 
   flowing with the loosening from physical, consciously attempt to 
   grasp and cling to the physical. And when the hour of transition 
   occurs they are disoriented and emotionally distraught. These are the 
   entities that are likely to become stuck on the Astral levels. It is 
   imperative that this transitional period prior to leaving the 
   physical vehicle be defined and accepted by people, that it be a 
   joyous experience, a graduation or a job well done.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Religion in many different forms down through the ages 
   has attempted to counter the effects of the fear of passing after the 
   fact usually, or during the actual transition, although the actual 
   rites today are meaningless to most people. The Catholic religion's 
   last rites at one time had their basis in attempting to ease the mind 
   of the person who was passing. The Irish wakes (the celebrations upon 
   the passing) also fit into this category. However, these after the 
   fact or during the fact reactive measures would not be necessary if 
   the individual was aware and fully benefited from the signals in the 
   transition period. For most entities, the transition period is a 
   neutral one. They are so closed off to their inner selves that to 
   some degree they are aware that a change is approaching but are 
   shielded or blinded by themselves to the nature of the change. Their 
   loved ones around them do not want to accept what is about to 
   transpire. This, in a sense, is due to the concept of 
   &quot;misery&quot; loving company. The physical plane as it exists 
   and has existed for thirteen thousand five hundred years is indeed a 
   miserable place.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It does not have to be this way but the inhabitants 
   create their own hell and they seek peace and joy outside themselves 
   through the company of another. This external need depends on the 
   other person being present in close proximity and of course 
   continuing to live. This results in many entities spiritual evolution 
   being retarded due to the strong willed influence of a well meaning 
   or well intentioned loved one not wanting to let them go. When the 
   person enters into the transition period, which as I mentioned before 
   is pronounced and can be observed easily by sensitives and people who 
   are not necessarily sensitive, the strong willed, well meaning loved 
   one aborts through various means the loosening and literally stops 
   the entity from divesting themselves of their physical vehicle.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This, from a Karmic standpoint, is not of benefit to the 
   person who retards the evolution of their loved one and it is not 
   love or the love energy that motivates the hindrance.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>If you think about people that you have known in passing 
   or that you have known well that have passed on, think about the 
   period, if you were associated with them, two to four weeks prior to 
   their departure. Think back to cues or signals that you may have 
   received from them. It may have been verbal things or it may have 
   been impressions that you yourself were picking up. But if you think 
   about it, you will find at least one example, perhaps more, of this transition.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We shall more than likely broadcast more information 
   about this transition period and appropriate strategies for dealing 
   with it in the near future as we continue our series on &quot;life 
   after death&quot;. Part of it or I should say part of anybody's 
   transition is related to those around them. And a new attitude 
   towards the passing from the physical plane needs to be developed 
   within people and within yourselves.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The physical vehicle is but a temporary focus for the 
   spirit. Very few entities take care of their vehicles. They don't pay 
   attention to the energies. They don't follow the necessary procedures 
   to allow the vehicle, the physical vehicle, to function to its 
   maximum potential. And so this makes the physical existence an 
   unpleasant one. This is compounded by looking outside one's self for 
   gratification, for companionship, for acceptance. All these things 
   truly must come from within, but when they come from without we want 
   the sources to remain with us. When one passes from the physical 
   plane it should be a joyous occasion. The transition period should be 
   a pleasant, joyous time, looking forward to the shedding of a heavy, 
   sluggish, dense, grossly inarticulate vehicle. We shall have more to 
   say on this in the future ................</FONT>
