   One Saturday night around 9 p.m., as I was out walking my dogs for 
   the evening, I noticed a very bright, ultra white light that was 
   traveling at a very high rate of speed up and across the sky just 
   above my line of vision. The light was so intensely bright it caught 
   my attention. At first I thought it was fireworks someone had shot 
   off, however, it was moving too quickly and was too high in the sky 
   to be fireworks. It flared white for about two seconds, then an 
   orange glow appeared underneath the white just before it blinked out 
   into darkness. I had a strange, unnerving sense of fear, as if I was 
   being watched.
  </P>
  <P>
   The next morning, I awoke feeling groggy, disoriented, and 
   &quot;hung-over&quot; even though I had not had anything to drink the 
   night before. Over the years, I have learned to associate this 
   feeling with a night of UFO activity. Around 2 p.m. that day, while I 
   was out walking my dogs again, I heard first and then saw a large, 
   blackish green helicopter with no markings fly directly above the 
   wooded area that I was walking in. What struck me about the 
   helicopter, which was similar in color, size, and noise level to 
   helicopters that frequent my neighborhood on mornings that I am in 
   this disoriented frame of mind, was how low it was flying; it was at 
   treetop level in a congested residential district. I could see that 
   the doors on both sides of the craft were open and, it was so close, 
   I could even identify the operator as a white male wearing dark blue 
   pants. Since this pattern of a noisy, unmarked helicopter was routine 
   on days I wake up feeling the way I did this Sunday morning, I took 
   note of it but went on with my day.
  </P>
  <P>
   I am a counselor at a community mental health center in a large 
   metropolitan area. It is routine for the counselors at my office to 
   break the week up into shifts to handle the large volume of incoming 
   crisis calls we receive every day. The counselors sit in one office 
   with three phones during their shift. The office has three large 
   windows that comprise one wall and the interior of the room is 
   clearly visible from the parking lot.
  </P>
  <P>
   At this time, I only worked the Tuesday afternoon shift. The Tuesday 
   following the weekend incidents of the strange light, grogginess and 
   noisy helicopter, I received a call from a man who at first presented 
   himself as needing assistance for a mental illness. He felt that he 
   was &quot;going crazy&quot;. He talked about having bizarre thoughts, 
   sometimes a sign of mental illness. However, the majority of symptoms 
   he presented himself as having were nonsensical; one symptom cluster 
   not related to another, making it difficult to get a handle on what 
   his problem might be. He presented like a person who is trying to 
   look like they have a mental illness but are uneducated about mental 
   illness so they utilize very stereotypical symptomology. At one point 
   the problems he stated he was having were so illogical I thought he 
   might be on drugs. This went on for about five minutes.
  </P>
  <P>
   Then the conversation took an unusual and abrupt turn. The man 
   shifted his presentation<B> </B>so much that I made a mental note of 
   it. His speech became lucid and obviously goal directed. His thinking 
   appeared to &quot;clear up&quot; instantly.
  </P>
  <P>
   His first suspicious comments from this new lucid presentation were 
   that he had been discharged from a branch of the military and, at 
   this point, said he could not give an explanation as to why. He 
   indicated that he had a &quot;special knowledge&quot; and that this 
   special knowledge was related to alien activity on earth. He said 
   that this knowledge would one day &quot;have to be made public&quot;. 
   He indicated it was on tape &quot;somewhere&quot;.
  </P>
  <P>
   At this point he began a series of questions to me which would, over 
   the course of the conversation, become more and more direct and 
   &quot;loaded&quot;. Probably because he wasn't sure how much I would 
   cooperate with the conversation, his initial line of interrogation 
   was vague. He asked me if I believed in alien contact with humans. My 
   response was noncommittal. Then he asked me if I believed that humans 
   could be abducted by aliens. Again, I gave an evasive response. I was 
   definitely suspicious of this supposedly mentally ill person by this time.
  </P>
  <P>
   Now, perhaps out of frustration, he became very direct. He said that 
   he himself was an alien abductee. He said that he had talked, against 
   orders, on the military base about his experiences and that this was 
   the reason for his discharge. I found it significant that after I 
   refused to be &quot;baited&quot; so to speak by his initial line of 
   questioning, he was now divulging more information; more details of 
   his own alleged experiences.
  </P>
  <P>
   I feel sure this was an attempt to draw me out and get me to engage 
   in the conversation. I was suspicious but my curiosity got the better 
   of me and I remained on the line with him. In ten years of providing 
   Mental Health services, I had never received a call like this before 
   and I wanted to see where it would lead.
  </P>
  <P>
   In response to his direct question about if I believed in alien 
   abduction, I replied &quot;Some people do believe in that&quot;. This 
   response appeared to both aggravate and encourage him, for he then 
   went on to ask me more questions about controversial topics. For 
   instance, he asked me if I believed that if people knew the truth 
   about alien activity on the Earth, did I not think that this would 
   topple the religious and economic structures of our society?
  </P>
  <P>
   His questions were now alarming me. Every instinct told me that this 
   was no<B> </B>mentally ill person<B> </B>calling in for assistance. I 
   had been targeted for this call; the fact that the man had verified 
   my name at the beginning of the phone call, his calling directly into 
   the desk where I was randomly sitting that day, his abrupt shift in 
   presentation and increasingly more direct interrogation led me to the 
   conclusion that this man was &quot;pumping&quot; me for information 
   about my beliefs and knowledge about extra-terrestrials.
  </P>
  <P>
   The line of questions continued in this vein for several more 
   minutes. He showed no indication of ending the phone call. Therefore, 
   due to my rising level of suspicion and alarm at the unusual nature 
   of this call, I indicated that I needed to take other calls and would 
   have to get off the phone.
  </P>
  <P>
   He replied &quot;OK, I'll be talking to you -----&quot; and said my 
   name as if he really knew me. This is very unusual for mental health 
   calls as the client is too preoccupied with their problems to listen 
   to a name, particularly when it is only repeated once.
  </P>
  <P>
   Wanting to understand the situation better, about 6 months later, I 
   had a professional colleague conduct a hypnosis session with me. 
   While recalling this series of incidents under hypnosis, I remembered 
   some other startling details that I had previously repressed. First, 
   I remembered that in addition to the bright white/orange light, there 
   was an ominous, blacker than black circular object also in the sky, 
   directly to the right of the white light. It was this dark object 
   that sparked my fear, not the white light. The black object was no 
   bigger than a pin head, so it must have been a good distance away, 
   but it was clear in the night sky, as if in that one tiny area of the 
   sky all the light was sucked up. A black deeper than black.
  </P>
  <P>
   Next, I remembered what happened after I went to bed that Saturday 
   night. An inter-dimensional golden doorway had opened up on the wall 
   of my second floor bedroom; a golden arched doorway that I have seen 
   only one other time. Through this doorway came a golden &quot;moving 
   sidewalk.&quot; On the &quot;sidewalk&quot; were three beings.
  </P>
  <P>
   Two of the beings, a man and a woman, are people that have been 
   associated with me all of my life. When I was a child, I thought 
   these two people were my &quot;real&quot; parents. Now, years later, 
   they look no different than they did over thirty years ago. Standing 
   behind them was a large male &quot;light being&quot;, an 
   extra-terrestrial of such high energy frequency that they have no 
   physical form. Whenever the &quot;light beings&quot; are present, 
   it's serious.
  </P>
  <P>
   The three of them got me out of bed, and we rode the golden 
   &quot;moving sidewalk&quot; through the inter-dimensional arched 
   doorway onto the waiting flying saucer that was hovering at treetop 
   level outside my second story bedroom. While the details of what 
   happened next did not surface from my subconscious, I do know that 
   there was some type of emergency, unplanned meeting that night with 
   the good aliens and the people on this earth that are aliens 
   incarnated in human form. I feel that the meeting was about adding 
   some kind of extra layer of protection to us since our types have 
   been getting abducted by the grays.
  </P>
  <P>
   So in summary, I saw a light in the sky on a Saturday night, an 
   extra-terrestrial contact took place later that evening, the next 
   afternoon a noisy black helicopter flew over me at a dangerously low 
   level, and two days later, the only day of the week that I was 
   scheduled to take calls, I receive a strange phone call from a man 
   claiming to need help from mental illness who gives bogus symptoms 
   and then shortly becomes lucid and starts questioning me about 
   extra-terrestrials. I feel it is significant that I received the call 
   at approximately the same time of day that I saw the helicopter fly 
   over me the previous Sunday, and also that this would have been the 
   first opportunity that the man would have been assured of getting me 
   on the telephone at work since the days I do not work the crisis line 
   I am very busy and essentially unavailable by phone.
  </P>
  <P>
   All a coincidence? I don't believe so. Someone is keeping track of 
   extra-terrestrial visits. They want to make themselves known the next 
   day by flying noisy, black, unmarked, what a colleague identified as 
   Viet Nam era Huey, helicopters. Who's behind it? I don't know. But 
   someone flies the helicopters and they invariably show up the day 
   after a strange night that I have learned to associate with UFO experiences.
  </P>
  <P>
   The strange telephone call? I'm confident it was not a mentally ill 
   person. I feel that it was an attempt to pump me for information and 
   to imply that &quot;they&quot; knew something about me. When the 
   stranger signed off the call, he said, &quot;I'll be talking to YOU 
   -------!&quot; He was adamant that he meant me personally. So far, I 
   haven't heard back from him but it won't surprise me if I do.
