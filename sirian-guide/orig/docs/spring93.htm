   AN OBVIOUS ALIEN EVENT WITH POSSIBLE TIME SPLICING AND 
   ELECTROMAGNETIC EFFECT
  </P>

   By a Pensacola, Florida Resident
  </P>
  <P>
   In the late Spring of 1993, a most unusual event occurred that had 
   paranormal phenomena with physical manifestations.
  </P>
  <P>
   Let me begin by saying that in early 1993, there was a problem with 
   automobiles being vandalized in driveways at night in my 
   neighborhood. In response to this problem, I installed a surveillance 
   camera on the driveway attached to a VCR set to record the entire 
   night period (where the surveillance equipment was set up in the 
   dining room, a 4 foot twin fluorescent light was left on), a motion 
   activated light on the driveway and a security light on the side of 
   the house that activated at dusk. It was my routine to review the 
   tapes every few days to reuse them if nothing suspicious was observed.
  </P>
  <P>
   One night, I had gone to the bedroom about 2am to take a shower and 
   go to bed. I had just started to prepare my shower when the lights 
   flickered. These are fluorescent lights.
  </P>
  <P>
   This happened a couple of times. Then on the side of the house with 
   the bedroom and attached bath, there were noises; banging on the side 
   of the house and garbled sound like voices. The lights flickered a 
   couple of more times.
  </P>
  <P>
   At this point, I decided I should investigate as it sounded like 
   prowlers. I went into the living room and immediately discovered that 
   the twin fluorescent light over the surveillance equipment was out. 
   The light was still on in the kitchen however, so I proceeded out the 
   back sliding glass door on to the back porch. Outside, I immediately 
   noticed that my security light was OUT on the side of the house where 
   noises and muffled voices had occurred. I ran back inside for a 
   flashlight and other security equipment as it appeared I had 
   intruders in my back yard.
  </P>
  <P>
   When I quickly came back with the light, I investigated the area but 
   saw nothing. This didn't take but a couple of minutes as it is a 
   small back yard. I was confused as there was nothing there and no 
   vehicles or people on the street.
  </P>
  <P>
   So, I assumed that the light was out because the outside circuit 
   breaker, a ground interrupter unit that had given me much trouble, 
   had tripped again. However, I discovered that the circuit breaker was 
   NOT tripped.
  </P>
  <P>
   After checking the breaker in the garage, I went back into the house 
   and climbed on a chair to check the twin 4 foot fluorescent light 
   fixture that was out. I immediately discovered that the primary tube 
   was hanging partially OUT of the fixture. I reinserted the tube 
   properly and the light came back on. The weird thing was that I had 
   been in that room before going back to the shower to check the 
   surveillance equipment and the light was WORKING. If you know 
   anything about fluorescent tube lights, they do NOT unscrew themselves.
  </P>
  <P>
   I was rather worked up at the prospect of having a prowler and was 
   moving pretty fast. It should have taken less than 10 minutes to 
   check outside, check the breaker box and check the light fixture. 
   However, when I got back to the bedroom, the clock indicated more 
   than 25 minutes had elapsed. My wife, who participated in the event 
   from inside the house, and I were confused as to how much time had 
   passed. It simply did not take that long to check things out.
  </P>
  <P>
   Then, once again in the bathroom I looked out the window and the 
   security light was ON!
  </P>
  <P>
   However, the final evidence came a few days later when I was 
   reviewing the surveillance tapes. When reviewing the one from that 
   night, at the time when the disturbance occurred, approximately 
   2:05am, there was over 18 minutes of BLANK RECORDING on the 
   surveillance tape. This means that the VCR was recording but there 
   was no signal for over 18 minutes. With no lapse in the recording 
   signal, the driveway suddenly reappears.
  </P>
  <P>
   I still don't know what happened that night but the facts are rather 
   simple. Something disrupted the electric power but did not knock it 
   out, something knocked out the security light, something unscrewed 
   the primary tube of a twin 4 foot fluorescent fixture to render it 
   inoperable, something was banging on the side of the house with the 
   deactivated security light with other strange sounds resembling 
   muffled conversation and the surveillance VCR recorded a BLANK signal 
   for over 18 minutes; the perceived length of time of the incident. 
   The security light and the surveillance camera started working again 
   at approximately the same time after the incident.
  </P>
  <P>
   I can only say that my wife and I KNOW that it did NOT take long to 
   check things out. And we both were surprise at what the clock 
   registered; we commented to each other that it did NOT take that 
   long. I have no doubt that something weird happened that night. The 
   light fixture had been in place for 9 years and never unscrewed 
   itself. It has not done it again in 6 years. Nothing else has 
   malfunctioned either.
  </P>
  <P>
   From past experience, I would say that this was classic 
   extra-terrestrial activity. I feel that the light fixture was 
   intentionally deactivated in a mechanical way (no feasible 
   explanation) to draw attention to the incident. The other occurrences 
   could possibly be explained away but a fluorescent tube does not 
   unscrew itself from the fixture.
  </P>
  <P>
   Perhaps one day I will find out what REALLY happened that night that 
   is now referred to as WEIRD MONDAY.
