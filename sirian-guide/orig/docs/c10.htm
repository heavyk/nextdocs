   It was now 1977. I had a number of interesting experiences including 
   Out of Body Experiences and Reincarnation recall. Automatic writing 
   was, well Automatic. In fact, I discovered it was handy to use when I 
   was doing my professional Counseling. The client just assumed I was 
   taking notes, not consulting with the spirit world for a read out on them.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   However, the one thing that disappointed me was that I couldn't see 
   anything. Other people talked about seeing auras but I couldn't no 
   matter how hard I tried. I tried every technique I read but none of 
   them worked. Even my friend could see them.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I could not get my eyes to &quot;see&quot; auras. Then, one day it 
   occurred to me, why not let my subconscious &quot;see&quot; for me. I 
   would look at a scene and at the same time have a mental image of the 
   scene. Then, I asked my subconscious to supply to the mental scene, 
   what I was not seeing with my eyes. WOW !!!!!!!! It worked!!!!!!! All 
   sorts of things appeared in the mental image that I could not see 
   physically. However, being rather concrete, which is probably why I 
   couldn't &quot;see&quot; in the first place, I wasn't sure if it was 
   just my imagination. So I worked with it to test if it was real.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Initially, there was not much that could be verified. But, I 
   discovered another interesting aspect. I found that if I focused on a 
   person, I could actually see &quot;mental movies&quot;. The scenes 
   were like on tape and would replay themselves as long as I paid 
   attention to it. I could shift scenes with them as well.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The first chance I had to check the validity of this was at a meeting 
   of people who were interested in psychic phenomena. I had seen a 
   notice at one of the metaphysical bookstores and had decided to go. 
   Although I am not a social person, I was thirsting for knowledge and 
   to hear about others' experiences.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   There was this fellow there that caught my attention. It wasn't the 
   person so much as the mental movie that started playing when I 
   focused on him. It was the same thing over and over. I saw this 
   person, although they looked slightly different, particularly since 
   they were dressed from the 1800's, riding a black horse. The horse 
   was walking along but something happened to frighten it. It started 
   bucking and the rider lost control. He was thrown to the ground but 
   hit in such a way that it obviously broke his neck. I could tell that 
   he was dead.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I saw this scene repeat itself every time I focused on this guy. This 
   was somewhat new to me and it occurred how I could validate what I 
   was seeing. I simply asked the guy two questions:
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   1. Have you been having problems with your neck? Answer. Yes, I have 
   had to go to a chiropractor because it has been so painful.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   2. Do you like horses? Answer. I don't like horses; I can't stand them.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   When he asked me why I had asked those questions, I told him about 
   the scene that was replaying itself around him. He was underwhelmed 
   but that didn't matter to me. What excited me was that I had 
   discovered that my subconscious could supply me with what my eyes 
   couldn't see. And, more important, people projected information about 
   things that were currently happening to them, no matter which life to 
   which it was related.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I decided that I needed to work to refine this &quot;Seeing&quot;.
