   I Bid you a good evening.
  </P>
  <P>
   I would like to commend you for the progress that has been made up to 
   this point. It would appear that the opposition is quite displeased, 
   and they have been putting a great deal of pressure on some of the 
   members of the circle. Each of you have your weak spots, so to speak. 
   'Tis best that you be consciously aware of them so that they can't be 
   used against you. It seems appropriate at this point to cite an old 
   cliche, that is; that it's always darkest before the dawn.
  </P>
  <P>
   We began this work a long time ago. We've all spent a great deal of 
   earth time putting each brick in place to build the structure. It 
   means so much to all of us here and to each of you; each in your own 
   way. All have various roles to perform. Some will make it, some 
   won't; but the choice is yours. To cite another cliche, they say the 
   path of righteousness is narrow. 'Tis true, because it's harder to 
   climb uphill than it is to slide downhill. 'Tis easy to fall, many of 
   us have. But we have the choice of getting up again, carrying on. As 
   I mentioned before, tis important for each of you to look into the 
   past. It could save you many scratches and bruises on the downward 
   slide. Take heart. We have entered into a phase that's been long in 
   the making, and it's new -- very new. Even we here, have to grapple 
   for new ways to accomplish the purposes, as time ticks away.
  </P>
  <P>
   Now I would like to say that the solution to resolving the 
   difficulties that presently exist lies in team work and team effort; 
   the combination of energies. Combine them, focus them to the points 
   that need to be directed and they will find a receptive atmosphere. 
   There are those of you here who will not understand these words but 
   those of you here that will, that is to whom it's directed. Carry on, 
   continue, strive to evolve in a move upwards. It's by far the shorter 
   path in the long run.
  </P>
  <P>
   I Bid You A Good Evening.
