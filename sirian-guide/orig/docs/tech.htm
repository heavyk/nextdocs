   <FONT SIZE=4>EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL CRAFT COMPONENTS - AN OVERVIEW</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   I'm not going to pretend I know what most of this means. I'm just to 
   repeat it as the messenger.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>Metallurgy</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   The most commonly used metal in extra-terrestrial craft construction 
   is HYDROGEN metal. It originates naturally on some planets but not on 
   earth. Like Superman on Earth, HYDROGEN metal is for all practical 
   purposes indestructible. It is very light in weight. Due to its 
   incredible strength, it can be very thin.
  </P>
  <P>
   The second most common metal is Titanium Alloys. The metals used for 
   the alloys are available in limited quantities on Earth and are 
   referred to as rare Earth elements.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>Power Source</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   The most common power source from most extra-terrestrial 
   civilizations is an antimatter system. The antimatter is contained in 
   a dual envelop electromagnetic sphere. The sphere is created by 
   multiple redundancy, self-healing components.
  </P>
  <P>
   The size of the containment spheres range from 3 inches to 12 inches 
   in multiples of 3. There are none larger than 12 inches in diameter 
   allowed in this solar system.
  </P>
  <P>
   Power is produced by injecting a Hydrogen atom stripped of the 
   electron. It passes through electromagnetic membrane one which seals 
   behind it as it enters membrane two, hence the dual envelop 
   electromagnetic sphere. The reaction is controlled by a precise 
   calculation of antimatter quantity to Hydrogen nucleus quantity formula.
  </P>
  <P>
   The anti-matter power source is enclosed in a detachable module on 
   the bottom of the craft. If the redundancy system fails, the craft 
   automatically does whatever maneuver is necessary to eject the module 
   away from structures. There is a secondary power source of stored 
   energy that can sustain the vehicle until help arrives.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>Shielding</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   All extra-terrestrial craft use shielding when in operation. The 
   shielding for most civilizations is a dis-harmonic system meaning 
   that all energy striking the shield that is not the shield's 
   frequency makes the shield stronger. The shield is programmed to 
   rapidly and randomly cycle through various frequencies unlikely to be 
   encountered naturally. This reduces weapon effectiveness against the shields.
  </P>
  <P>
   Also, just moving through the Earth atmosphere makes the shields 
   stronger due to the dis-harmonic frequencies encountered. This is why 
   moving extra-terrestrial vehicles have different color displays at 
   various times. The brighter the apparent light source, the more 
   powerful the shield.
