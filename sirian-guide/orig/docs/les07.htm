   <FONT SIZE=4>THE ATLANTEAN TRINITY</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The Atlantean Trinity was Anatau, Jeortau, and Sanatau. 
   This is the retreated triad that we spoke of last week.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Anatau is a FIRST RAY female and exists within a 
   humanoid feline vehicle. The fur of this being is red and covers the 
   hair portion of the head as with a human, but also a small narrow 
   line of red fur goes down the spine and covers the nether regions; 
   therefore this creature does not take to the wearing of clothing as 
   humans do. This entity can be read about in the Egyptian myths of Sekmet.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Jeortau is a SECOND RAY male and inhabits a humanoid 
   vehicle that has a huge wing span. He is buff or golden in color with 
   huge bright blue faceted eyes. A truly magnificent creature. He and 
   Anatau are twin beings.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Sanatau is THIRD RAY and more human like than the other 
   two although he would stand out in any crowd. He has black, coarse 
   pleated hair, beard plaited, tied with gold chain and the whole of 
   his eyes slant upward. His eyes gleam rays of indigo or white light. 
   Sanatau is as fierce looking as the golden dove (Jeortau) is loving, 
   graceful and beautiful.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It is often said by entities within your system that 
   love is the greatest power. We would like to clarify this statement. 
   Love is not to be considered a power, in the true meaning of the 
   word, as primal energy. Love is the motivating force.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The FIRST RAY is &quot;will&quot; = the power.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The SECOND RAY is love and wisdom = the motivator.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The THIRD RAY is manas (all mentation) = the means.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The three above entities are whom we spoke of last week 
   as having arrived here from another universe. And having completed 
   their task, retreated into a mountain fortress waiting to be summoned again.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>These entities took upon themselves the task of 
   personifying the three above aspects upon the physical. They are of a 
   FIRST RAY triad. Therefore humans did not identify with them very well.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Their teaching for humanity was presented and taught by 
   a SECOND RAY triad now known to you as Isis, Osiris, and Ra and a 
   THIRD RAY triad of Tahuta (Toth), Venus, and Saturn.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In order for you to get a clear idea of the meaning and 
   significance of these entities, we have had to mix the Egyptian, 
   Roman, and Greek names. We will also use the Hindu names and 
   descriptions when and where they are appropriate.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>For you to get a better understanding of the manner in 
   which the &quot;gods&quot; lived and worked, we will have to give you 
   some background on their functioning. The species to which they 
   belong do not biologically reproduce. When there is need of another 
   of them, a triad creates another from energy. Hence, they work in 
   threes - one analogous to a female and two analogous to males. The 
   two males are the active workers whereas the female is the recipient 
   and transmitter of her ray type energy.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Here you have the reason why Godheads usually have one 
   female and two males. It is the result of this groups influence even 
   unto this day. Also, this is why it was so difficult for the early 
   humans to figure out the marital status of the &quot;gods&quot;. The 
   transfer of energy from female to male appeared to be sexual in 
   nature. Whereas to these beings, sex had very little to do with 
   reproduction and all to do with energy. Also, these beings could be 
   related and look as if they belonged to different worlds. The system 
   where they originated and their purpose is simply alien to the human mind.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We will give you detailed information concerning the 
   rest of this pantheon so that you may become very familiar with them 
   in order to better pick the one who's part you wish to play.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>A DESCRIPTION OF THE MENTAL PLANE</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It is now time to proceed to the description of the 
   MENTAL PLANE. You will note that there are three vehicles upon the 
   MENTAL PLANE: the ABSTRACT MIND upon the top sub level; the SOLAR 
   ANGEL (causal body, soul, egoic body, &amp;c.) upon the second, third 
   plus some on the fourth sub planes; and the CONCRETE MIND which 
   functions on part of the fourth, the fifth, sixth and seventh sub planes.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The material of the bottom three sub planes retains form 
   to your physical senses but the top three sub planes are formless as 
   you would recognize form, although to the faculties native to that 
   region there is form. These sub planes are made up of very tenuous 
   material. Here your concrete mind is EXTREMELY busy thinking thoughts 
   that create forms within this medium. The forms are created at the 
   speed of thought which is measureless to the physical. In fact, upon 
   the MENTAL PLANE there occurs an overlap of the past, present and future.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The SOUL is to the MONAD as the physical vehicle is to 
   the SOUL. It is made up of a Deva, originating from the sun, that 
   gives its essence so that the MONAD can incarnate into the physical 
   and gain experience. The MONAD can only send itself downward to the 
   point of the SOUL level. At this point, the SOLAR ANGEL collects the 
   MONADs energy, circulating the energy through its essence, then 
   redirecting it into the vehicles that make up the personality.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The SOLAR ANGEL performs this service of stepping the 
   energy down for the MONAD until the material of the vehicles can take 
   the charge. This occurs at the fourth initiation where the SOLAR 
   ANGEL, having completed his task, is released and returns to the sun. 
   At that point, the MONAD can transmit directly to the personality 
   without shattering its vehicles.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The ABSTRACT MIND resides upon the first sub level of 
   the MENTAL PLANE and is the instrument of thought on those levels for 
   the MONAD. Here the entity lives within the group mind, ending 
   separateness while preserving individuality.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Operating on the ABSTRACT MIND level, you deal with 
   living forms of ideas. You do not have to talk about an idea that 
   remains unseen to your senses, you have it before you with all of its 
   aspects present for your consideration at once. Instead of the linear 
   &quot;one thing at a time&quot; thought processes of the CONCRETE 
   MIND, the ABSTRACT MIND perceives the whole form. This is a level 
   that you can also perceive causes of the physical rather than dealing 
   with results which is all the CONCRETE MIND has access to. The 
   CONCRETE MIND is equipped to deal with analyses whereas the ABSTRACT 
   MIND deals with the synthesis. It is possible for you to gain use of 
   the ABSTRACT MIND. We will give to you a process for this next week.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The MENTAL PLANE is represented by the circle and the 
   element air. Try viewing air and watch its movements. The untrained 
   mind flits about in just the same manner. And if you happen to be on 
   the THIRD, FIFTH or SEVENTH RAY, the flitting is even worse.</FONT>
