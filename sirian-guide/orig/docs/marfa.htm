   In Marfa, Texas unusual lights have been observed for as long as 
   there is recorded history of the area. The phenomena is so noted that 
   there is a Marfa Lights Festival in September. No one knows the 
   origin or cause of the lights.
  </P>
  <P>
   In June of 1997, our study group decided to go observe the Marfa 
   Lights. Marfa, Texas is approximately 1200 miles from our city; a 
   hard two day drive. We took several different cars to make the trip. 
   On the first day, the car I was in apparently had a missing time 
   experience as it took much longer to travel to San Antonio, Texas 
   than it should have. That experience has not been explored as of this writing.
  </P>
  <P>
   We went out to observe the lights two nights and were not 
   disappointed. The first night was very active. The second night, less 
   active but still lively.
  </P>
  <P>
   There were several unusual things that we noticed during our 
   observations. One was the occasional, high pitched tuning fork sound. 
   This sound could only be heard in one ear or the other by the 
   observers. Several times, the intensity level was so high as to cause 
   physical pain. There was no known source for this sound and was 
   something unique to all of us.
  </P>
  <P>
   The next unusual thing was that there were small strobe like flashes 
   out in the observation field but also happened between some of the 
   observers. The tuning fork sound seemed to be associated with these 
   bright white flashes. This was separate from the actual Marfa Lights 
   that looked like yellow flares in the distance.
  </P>
  <P>
   The final unusual thing was that several of us became able to 
   accurately predict when a light would appear and where. The lights 
   would just turn on, stay on either briefly or for many seconds. 
   Sometimes they would appear to drift slightly but you could only tell 
   that with a fixed point of reference.
  </P>
  <P>
   The first night of observation, only a few of our study group went. 
   On the second night we all went. That night, it appeared that there 
   was a large dull gray metallic object just above where all the light 
   activity was taking place.
  </P>
  <P>
   Are the Marfa Lights a natural phenomena? I personally don't think 
   so. It was clear that the environment was impacting on all of the 
   observers. The high pitched tuning fork sounds were objectively heard 
   and the flashes of strobe like white light objectively seen. Also, 
   when videotaped, the Marfa Lights themselves recorded as diamond 
   shaped as the optics stripped away the red orange color.
  </P>
  <P>
   The Marfa Lights. A very interesting phenomena. We were fortunate 
   that there was such activity during our visit but then, was it a coincidence?
