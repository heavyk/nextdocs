  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   When people think of a SHADOW, they think of a dark outline caused by 
   light being blocked by a solid object. Because of this common 
   association, the term has been selected by an advanced, time travel 
   capable extra-terrestrial civilization as a code word for what they 
   view is a necessary component of altering the space/time continuum.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   TIME SPLICING is a technique used by this advanced extra-terrestrial 
   civilization whereby a contactee can be physically gone for an 
   extended period of time and then be placed back within 20 minutes of 
   the actual departure. It is only used when a contactee has been gone 
   more than 24 hours. Sometimes, the contactee is gone for weeks or 
   even months, depending on the mission they are required to fulfill.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Obviously, the ability to alter the time/space continuum is fairly 
   impressive. But even with this capability, the extra-terrestrials do 
   not want to disrupt the normal flow of events excessively. To 
   counteract this problem, they have developed what they have code 
   named the SHADOW system.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The SHADOW is a functionally identical, programmed clone of the 
   individual contactee that takes his or her place while they are gone. 
   The SHADOW fulfills whatever requirements are necessary to maintain 
   the normal, most likely flow of events. When the contactee is 
   returned, the SHADOW is retrieved by the extra-terrestrials.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Due to the fact that this particular extra-terrestrial civilization's 
   time travel technology has a +/- twenty minute window, it can lead to 
   some unusual results. For example, suppose the SHADOW was asked to 
   complete a task and did so. The contactee returns, let's say, 12 
   minutes after completion of the task. The task has been completed but 
   the contactee is unaware of it. However, the people around the 
   contactee are aware of the task completion and if the task was of 
   some significance, it does lead to confusion.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I know of a case where a contactee was away with a SHADOW 
   replacement. The SHADOW was asked by the wife to put something away. 
   The contactee returned after this action had taken place. It was not 
   a critical item. A number of months later, the wife asked the 
   contactee where it was and he said he had no idea what she was 
   talking about. The contactee was then told that he had picked up this 
   item and took it somewhere. Well, that was news to the contactee. The 
   item was not really critical and was never found.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   You would think that the extra-terrestrials would correct these 
   details but they think on an entirely different level from humans. 
   They classify as trivial things that most humans hold dear. I suppose 
   I can see it to an extent. After all, when you have the ability to 
   disrupt time/space, that is powerful. If they were malicious, they 
   could really mess things up. This is why not every extra-terrestrial 
   civilization has the ability to time travel and I doubt that humans 
   will acquire it anytime soon if ever.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Just another example of how long a SHADOW can function for a 
   contactee that is away. A female contactee had recalled an experience 
   of being pregnant and giving birth. This was revealed to her in a 
   &quot;dream&quot;. However, when she woke up, she fully expected to 
   see the child there and was shocked when she did not. Apparently, a 
   SHADOW filled in for this person for a number of months. When the 
   contactee returned, it was night and the SHADOW had not done anything 
   to draw attention to the experience. The woman just had the knowledge 
   of having been pregnant and giving birth; actually it was more than 
   knowledge as they had all the feelings and sensations that go along 
   with such a complex and powerful experience for a woman.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   So if you know someone who has UFO experiences, you can truthfully 
   look at them and wonder if it's REALLY them or is it their SHADOW.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I must say the SHADOW system is a strange concept but it does explain 
   why people have told me that I said or did things that &quot;I&quot; 
   never said or did. Perhaps this has happened to you as well.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I only present the concept of the SHADOW for those that need it to 
   understand some cause of confusion in their lives. It is real; it 
   does happen. Those of you that have experienced it, you will know 
   what I mean.
