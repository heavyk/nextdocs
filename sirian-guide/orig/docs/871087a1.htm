  <P>
   Greetings to you along the path, it is I D.K. This evening we would 
   briefly like to speak of the parallels between the present and the 
   past. The past to which we refer is the time of Atlantis. As has been 
   mentioned the electromagnetic field, the concentration of energy, was 
   very great in the land mass known as Atlantis.
  </P>
  <P>
   This was intentional. It had specific effects upon the inhabitants 
   one of which was large physical vehicles. Another of which was an 
   extreme orientation to the astral plane; a duality existed. The 
   consciousness having a reference point that moved back and forth 
   between the two.
  </P>
  <P>
   In the present time the electromagnetic field is altering. The energy 
   level is increasing. The duality is once again beginning to impact 
   upon the psyches of individuals. Many patterns from the time of 
   Atlantis are surfacing. Many entities incarnated at present were also 
   a part of that system.
  </P>
  <P>
   As the energy levels increase the duality becomes more pronounced. 
   Individuals will tend to have a greater orientation to the astral 
   plane and to have a less rigid orientation to the physical. This will 
   be confusing to many. Ultimately a system needs to be provided to 
   explain what is happening at the individual level. This we shall work 
   to address at a future time.
  </P>
  <P>
   You will see a tendency towards emotionalism amplified. There will be 
   peaks; there will be plateaus. But there will be not be a decrease in 
   amplification until the cycle has run its course.
  </P>
  <P>
   Karmic issues will be thrust upon the psyche at a faster pace with a 
   greater impact than in the past. Issues unresolved will surface with 
   increasing vigor.
  </P>
  <P>
   The parallel between the time past and the present must be 
   contemplated for there are many lessons to be learned, many patterns 
   to be altered. Emotions, sensations long unresolved must be met. 
   Preferably before they reach you. This is something that is 
   applicable to all entities. It is presented for your consciousness to 
   understand what is occurring around you; what is happening within as well.
  </P>
  <P>
   The increase in energy will continue to boost capacity. Preparation 
   for the increase is necessary.
  </P>
  <P>
   We are working to build a channel that will filter out emotionalism 
   that will work to neutralize as much as possible factors that 
   adversely affect communications; this will require some time and effort.
  </P>
  <P>
   You might say that you must build a shelter, a tunnel if you will, 
   from our level of perspective to yours that will shelter the 
   information from the storm that is raging. The storm will continue to 
   increase making the transmission of information even more critical. 
   At the same time they will intensify factors that work against the 
   reception of the transmissions. We are working from our perspective 
   to resolve the situation. We would ask that you work from your 
   perspective as well to avoid the pitfalls of the past. To take care 
   of the emotionalism as it surfaces, to sort out that which is your 
   own and that which is not.
  </P>
  <P>
   An important key to the successful transmission is filtering out 
   external influences. In this case the extreme emotionalism that is 
   raging about you. You will also need to, in a sense, insulate 
   yourself from the planet for the planet is also in turmoil. And this 
   as you have seen can have physical as well as emotional impact.
  </P>
  <P>
   This also will continue for the indefinite future even as the 
   planetary events occur. Relief will be temporary for so much has been 
   stored that what is considered in human consciousness catastrophe is 
   but a fraction of what has been created over thousands of years.
  </P>
  <P>
   It is a culmination of thousands of years since the time of Atlantis. 
   Thousands of years of emotions, aggressions, hostilities, assaults 
   against self and the planet. All of this from a karmic standpoint is 
   building to the culmination point.
  </P>
  <P>
   From your perspective insulation is best. The majority of humanity 
   must experience what has been created. It is the karmic pattern. 
   However, you must isolate yourselves from this to effectively serve, 
   to effectively help those that will be experiencing the turmoil; the 
   crisis from the accumulation.
  </P>
  <P>
   The fact that the accumulation is of such long duration will be 
   confusing to most. They will not realize that at many different 
   points on the physical plane their journeys through life have 
   contributed to the pool of which they are now swimming. This must be 
   conveyed to them for understanding will help them alter their 
   perspective and ultimately blunt the impact of this accumulation.
  </P>
  <P>
   As we have said it is necessary to alter that which occurred at the 
   time of Atlantis which was the destruction of an entire cultural 
   pattern. This time it is necessary to have an alteration. An 
   alteration of the pattern to where the limitations and the short 
   sightedness are replaced with an expansion of awareness; an expansion 
   of compassion; an expansion of unconditional love.
  </P>
  <P>
   At this point we have conveyed what we felt necessary today. We are 
   working within the circumstances to resume the communication cycle. 
   However, if there are any questions you may ask them at this time and 
   we will endeavor to formulate a response.
  </P>
  <P>
   One point from last time that we would like to address concerning new 
   information. We have found it necessary to transmit information on 
   numerous occasions as a form of review to make the consciousness 
   aware of the important points and to serve as you would call a 
   validity check, in other words, the information has continuity over time.
  </P>
  <P>
   ......................... With that we shall close the communication 
   session. Continue to work to build the channel to strengthen it so 
   that the complex information that must be transmitted can come 
   through clearly and efficiently.
  </P>
  <P>
   We thank you for the opportunity to resume these communications. Our 
   blessings upon you and our hope that as you travel the path the 
   reward and fulfillment of the progress is integrated into your 
   perception and awareness.
