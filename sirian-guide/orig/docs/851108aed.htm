   Presented November 8, 1985

  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Concerning resumption of our dictation. As you know for 
   a great length of time we have been unable to present the material 
   that is necessary. Our first priority has been the presentation of 
   material of life after death. The value of this is great to people on 
   the physical plane who will soon make the transition.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Before we resume this presentation we would like to 
   harmonize the circle. In order to do this we would like for each of 
   you to visualize a connection of dark blue energy at the heart center 
   connected to the heart center of the person on your right until a 
   completed circle is accomplished. Visualize blue energy as 
   circulating from right to left in a continuous flow of harmony and 
   peace. Imbue it with the qualities of wisdom and harmony to set the 
   stage for our resumption this evening.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Tonight we would like to focus upon the state of 
   consciousness after the death transition has been made. Suffice it to 
   say that there are seven levels of consciousness beyond the physical 
   one. However, only the lower three are of importance to the physical 
   plane consciousness and to the evolving entity. We should like to 
   deal with those three levels in appropriate detail.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Each level has sub-levels associated with it. Of course 
   the level closest to the physical plane involves that comprised of 
   the Astral. This as you know is the emotions. The closer to the 
   physical plane the more intense the emotion. As one travels through 
   the Astral level the intensity of the emotion lessens. However this 
   level of emotionalism is the first that is encountered and it is a 
   stopping point for many evolving entities. As we have mentioned in 
   the past the beliefs in life [physical plane beliefs] determine the 
   environment that the entity will encounter upon the death transition. 
   These beliefs can be limiting, repressive, disruptive. The whole 
   purpose of this monograph is to allow people the opportunity to 
   neutralize beliefs that will impede their evolutionary progress.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The Astral plane has a degree of chaos associated with 
   it. The chaos is directly proportional to the emotionalism. The lower 
   Astral is that area where nightmares; pure raw emotionalism collects. 
   It is the barrier between the physical plane and breaking through to 
   the higher levels of the Astral. Fortunately the majority of the 
   entities have progressed beyond that point and pass through the 
   region easily.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>However we shall first discuss the effects of material 
   beliefs. A person who spends their time focusing on the material 
   builds an entire system of thought forms that correspond to the 
   physical. Without looking for the spiritual it is not found at the 
   death transition. A number of people in Western Society are 
   handicapped by this materialism. And when they make the death 
   transition discover a world quite similar to the one they have left. 
   So much so that it is confusing to them.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>People who have no particular beliefs can also fall 
   victim to this illusion. People or entities with a like belief 
   structure tend to find each other and tend to create elaborate 
   thought forms resulting in communities quite like the ones that they 
   recently departed. Entire cities are built on the lower Astral. And 
   these entities follow through with routines quite similar to the ones 
   that they manifested on the physical plane. They even simulate the 
   typical functions of the physical plane such as eating, sleeping and 
   of course going to the bathroom. This state can last for an 
   indefinite period of time depending upon how strongly imbued the 
   individual with the orientation towards materialism. What the 
   teaching entities attempt to do is to infiltrate these cities of 
   illusion and work to wake the individual up if you will, for you can 
   say that these cities of illusion are an extended dream.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>There are two ways that the teaching entities attempt to 
   assist. As mentioned infiltration of the illusion, also when the 
   entity enters into the simulation of sleep. They in a sense free 
   their consciousness and attempts are made to break through to instill 
   within them the higher knowledge that this level is a lower one that 
   needs to be transcended.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>For some entities their level of development is such 
   that this is as high as they can go. And what occurs to these 
   particular entities is that they live a life, if you will, and die 
   from that life and this death is of course being born again into the 
   physical plane. However a number of the inhabitants are simply 
   handicapped, blinded by the created thought forms of their most 
   recent physical plane existence. The ones at the lower level of 
   development can and are reached by the teachers who integrate 
   themselves for the purpose of teaching into the their reality.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The ones that are blinded, if you will by the delusions 
   are more difficult to reach. They are using their extra development 
   to close out, due to the nature of their acquired beliefs, things 
   outside of their reality. The less evolved entities do not have this 
   capacity. They are at this level to learn, to be assisted and then 
   once again to return to the physical plane where continued growth 
   will be accomplished, hopefully.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The third level of the Astral is the highest of the 
   Astral Emotionalism still as an element. But at this level the 
   individual is not totally involved in the material illusions. The 
   individual has the capacity to achieve more abstract teachings. They 
   are still oriented towards the physical and towards the material. 
   They still choose to possess forms that resemble the human physical 
   vehicle and they insist upon social clusters. The quality is such 
   that the resemblance to the physical plane although somewhat removed 
   is still there.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>At this level the teachers have a more direct input. It 
   is not as difficult to reach the individuals. Structures exist that 
   correspond to the symbols of learning and at this level the upper 
   most of the Astral, the attempt is made to teach the inhabitants the 
   nature of relationships and the importance of control of the 
   emotions. At this level more of consciousness is involved in the 
   planning of the next incarnation and the person does not feel the 
   need to live if you will. Assimilation of a physical plane existence 
   form, as I say, is still important and emotionalism still operates in 
   that relationships from the earth or physical plane sense do have a 
   tendency to proliferate. However the teaching does occur to people or 
   entities at this level are more aware of the higher thinking or the 
   potential for spiritual thinking and attend the training classes if 
   you will.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It is at this level that many of the problems associated 
   with relationships must be resolved. The individual is faced with the 
   test of overcoming the shall we say &quot;bondage&quot; that most 
   people subject themselves to concerning a relationship on the 
   physical plane. It is at this level that these things are worked out 
   and preparation is made to overcome it. This is one of the most 
   difficult levels for the evolving entity to transcend. Many 
   life-times are required. However if the entity can begin to integrate 
   the teachings, the spiritual teachings of this level into their 
   physical plane incarnations the impetus is given or created so that 
   the nature of relationships are resolved on the physical plane and 
   upon the death transition. The entity breaks through the barrier and 
   rises to the next plane or level of consciousness.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>At this point we would like to generalize a bit and 
   state that the individual entity exists simultaneously on each plane 
   including the physical one. In chronological time or sequential time, 
   linear time is only a convention that the human consciousness must 
   have in order to function. However consciousness, consciousness is 
   the key. Each plane has its vehicle that serves as a repository for 
   the consciousness and what the entity is learning to do is to take 
   that consciousness back to its origin.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This is accomplished by the learning of lessons, by 
   removing the limiting beliefs that structure the reality on the lower 
   three planes. You can look upon it as a form of ascension. When 
   physical incarnations are no longer required when the lessons have 
   been successfully learned then the entity does cease to exist on the 
   physical plane and there is a final death transition. The same thing 
   must happen on each subsequent plane above, as the consciousness 
   collects itself and moves upward. The elementals, the essence of the 
   plane that served as the vehicle for the consciousness is no longer 
   required and it dissipates. What we hope to do with this information 
   is to help the individual achieve the boost necessary to break 
   through the Astral level into the mental. It is at the mental level 
   that many of the important lessons that prepare the entity to expand 
   beyond the mid-point are learned.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>However as long as emotionalism functions it will tend 
   to weigh the entity down on the Astral level. This will tend to 
   structure physical incarnation at the emotional level. &quot;The 
   Karmic patterns&quot; that the individual is confronted with will be 
   of an emotional nature. Emotionalism tends to feed upon emotionalism. 
   This results in a greater attraction to the physical plane and 
   fixation of the consciousness at the Astral.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In summary of what we have discussed this evening. 
   Emotionalism and relationships are two interwoven and important 
   lessons that the evolving entity must learn. They are most basic and 
   most difficult. Hopefully at the next communication session we will 
   have the opportunity to deal with the mental level. Just as a clue to 
   the nature of the mental level you will see why the people who or I 
   should say entities who have evolved to the upper mental levels tend 
   not to have what would be classified as traditional relationships on 
   the physical plane and their emotions are expressed not in a raw 
   uncontrolled form but a purer refined controlled form.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>My blessings upon you this evening. We are happy once 
   again to get back to work and are pleased that you have taken the 
   measures necessary to open the channels once again. Do not be 
   discouraged and do work to develop your capabilities to the fullest. 
   For time in your terms does exist and much needs to be brought to the 
   physical plane and put in a form an understandable form for people. 
   So that it will be available when it is needed in the near future.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Work to release your blocks, your fears. Work to free 
   your emotions. So that you will not be controlled by them. We are 
   working to help each of you develop your talents but it requires 
   perserverance and I suppose we could say some degree of sacrifice on 
   the physical plane. For your physical plane consciousness, for the 
   effort required does tend to displace things that consciousness 
   ordinarily would be doing on the physical plane. However as the days 
   ahead loom closer you will see that the effort that you expend now, 
   the choices that you make are very important. Go in peace and with 
   our blessings. SO BE IT.</FONT>
