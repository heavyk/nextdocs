   Out of Body Experiences. That is what me and my friend had been 
   working on among other areas of spiritual endeavors. By the time of 
   this visit, we had both had some success with conscious OOBEs.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The only technique we had found that worked was to program the 
   subconscious before going to sleep &quot;To Become Conscious&quot; 
   while asleep. Note the phase because it is very important. You DO NOT 
   want to wake up during an Out of Body Experience because that ends 
   the experience. You just want to become conscious.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Anyway, as had been my practice for several months, I did my routine 
   programming to become conscious while asleep and then went to sleep. 
   Well, at some point, my consciousness turned on.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The first thing I noticed was that I was stuck partially in my body 
   and could not move. However, the weird thing about an OOBE is that 
   you can SEE everything at once. I realized that Kerry, the spirit 
   that worked the OUIJA board for me was standing at my head. So I 
   mentally asked her to help me out. I next felt the sensation of hands 
   on my shoulders in a lifting motion and I was floating up.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I was still laying on my back but floating about two feet above my 
   body. Apparently, during an OOBE, thoughts are communication because 
   I immediately thought that it would be neat to see what my body 
   looked like. No sooner than I had this thought than Kerry flashed 
   back, &quot;Don't!! It will pull you back in!&quot; However, being 
   the somewhat stubborn sort, I ignored this advice and rolled my 
   astral body over so that I was facing my body. I only saw it for an 
   instant however because it pulled me back in like a vacuum cleaner. 
   Interestingly enough though, I still did not lose consciousness.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   So, I again mentally asked Kerry to help me out. This time I got 
   back, &quot;Oh, all right.&quot;
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Of course, I decided that if I got out this time, I wasn't going to 
   look at my body because I didn't want to get pulled back in again. 
   Having a conscious astral projection is very difficult to trigger and 
   this OOBE had already lasted longer than any up to this point. I 
   wanted to try to actually do something if I could.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Again, I felt lifted up by the shoulders until I was once again 
   floating above my body.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Now, I was mentally taking notes. The first thing I noticed was that 
   I was a lot heavier than I thought I would be. I also noticed that my 
   astral self was breathing and I got lighter with the inhalation.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I was on a roll this night. However, I worked to keep my emotions 
   neutral because I had read that emotionalism got the body agitated 
   and pulled you back in.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   So, since my friend and I had worked so hard to achieve Out of Body 
   Experiences, I decided to go visit him while I was astral.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I quickly learned something that night;. things are not always as you 
   expect. My friend was asleep upstairs and I assumed that I would 
   float up through the ceiling into his room.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   However, no sooner than I instituted the thought of visiting my 
   friend, I found myself moving at a 45 degree angle through the 
   outside wall!
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Although it was night, everything outside was gray; like twilight. It 
   had been like this inside too but I hadn't noticed it as much. I was 
   flying through the air like superman because that was the only thing 
   I could think to do. And, I was moving UP, UP, UP.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I have no idea where UP was. It wasn't in the air as such but it was UP.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I arrived at what looked like a typical school building, sort of like 
   the high school my friend and I had attended. There were the typical 
   double doors leading to a hall. I had to manually open the door to 
   enter as opposed to floating through them. I didn't get too far 
   inside before I felt my consciousness beginning to fade.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Darn, I thought. I'm losing it.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   However, my consciousness turned back on as I was exiting the school 
   building. I had the sensation that time had passed and I did indeed 
   meet with my friend although I couldn't remember a thing about it.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   This I didn't understand but I was fascinated that my consciousness 
   had turned back on and I was still OUT!
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Now I found myself going DOWN. Yes, I was literally descending and 
   soon I saw CLOUDS. When I broke through the cloud cover, I found 
   myself in a little town, not far from where I lived, where my parents 
   lived. I came in for a feet down soft landing.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I found myself standing under a street light facing a main road that 
   passed in front of my parents property. Everything still had that 
   gray, twilight look to it; sort of like a black and white movie. 
   However, I did notice something unusual. Around the power lines that 
   ran along the road, I could see the electromagnetic field. It 
   extended out from them at least a foot in diameter and was a 
   distinctly different color from the surrounding gray. It was tubular 
   like the shape of the wires.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Then I noticed something funny. There were two children, perhaps 10 
   or so floating around. Actually they were playing. I instinctively 
   knew they were asleep. What they were doing was flying into this 
   electromagnetic field around the power line which repelled them 
   causing them to bounce off. When they bounced off, they laughed like 
   two kids having a great time.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   So here I was, literally standing under this street light watching 
   two kids, obviously asleep, playing with the power line.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   This Out of Body Experience had really seemed to last a long time. So 
   I decided to go visit my cousin. I found myself taking off again. I 
   did discover that I had to inhale a few times to get lighter first 
   and I started heading in the direction of the town where I was living 
   where my cousin also lived. However, I got up in the air, was heading 
   in the proper direction and, the consciousness began to fade again. 
   Then, it was gone. I assumed that I had not succeeded in my last task.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   However, two days later when I returned to town, I saw my cousin who 
   immediately asked what in the world I had been doing two days 
   earlier. They said that they woke up and saw me floating in their 
   bedroom and it scared the pitootee out of them. They told me that 
   they thought I had died and was a ghost trying to communicate with them.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Well, I apologized but was impressed. Not only did I have the longest 
   conscious Out of Body Experience I had ever had to that point, I 
   actually had a witness to back up that it really happened. Even 
   though I don't remember the last part of it, I was going to see my 
   cousin when my consciousness faded.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Afterwards, I drove to to my parents town and physically stood in the 
   exact spot under the street lamp. What I saw, minus the flying kids 
   and halo around the power lines, was exactly what I had seen in my 
   out of body experience.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I don't know why the two goals of actually interacting with people 
   was blocked from the experience.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   TO BE CONTINUED. I LEARN TO &quot;SEE&quot;
