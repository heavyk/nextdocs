   <FONT SIZE=4>MONADIC PLANE</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The MONADIC plane is the second plane from the top and 
   is the repository for all life essences within this system. This is 
   due to the fact that this Solar System is perfecting the Second Aspect.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This plane is also the receiver of all SECOND RAY energy 
   sent from the Cosmic ASTRAL plane. Its color is indigo; blue so dark 
   that it can be compared to the sky at night.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>From the MONADIC radiates the Second Aspect or ray into 
   all other planes of this system. The fire of life burns there and 
   also radiates downward. It is the home of the HIGHER SELF and is the 
   place that humans are struggling to return to through evolution.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Upon the MONADIC plane, is the Monadic Capsule. In order 
   for the unmanifested power to manifest, it must ray forth The ONE. 
   The ONE is manifested power but incapable of action so it demands the 
   Third. The Second becomes necessary to relate the powers to their 
   creations. Therefore, creators in manifestation all have three 
   aspects. The human MONAD is no exception.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Upon the MONADIC plane, your Higher Self resides as a 
   CREATOR replete with its three aspects. If your MONAD is THIRD RAY 
   then your aspects are the FIRST, SECOND, and THIRD RAYS of the Cosmic 
   Third Ray.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>If you are ALIEN to this system, then somewhere in the 
   order of things resides your Higher Self, although it would have its 
   representative on some level in this system. Some ALIENS require 
   mechanisms to step down their vibrations so that they can exist on Earth.</FONT>
