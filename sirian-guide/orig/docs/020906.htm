   When I was a kid, I went to slumber parties a lot. Many of the girls 
   in my class were &quot;into&quot; spooky ghost types of things, like 
   conducting seances after the parents went to bed, playing with the 
   Ouija board, and chanting over the rigid body of one of the girls 
   that allowed the rest of us to raise her body high over our heads 
   with just our fingertips.
  </P>
  <P>
   I had always been interested in psychic phenomenon of any kind and 
   had sort of a knack for predicting things that were about to happen, 
   like the time I predicted my grandfather's (whom I had never met) 
   death when I was five years old, much to the amazement of my mother. 
   Friends liked to have me around because, as they told me, &quot;weird 
   things happen around you&quot;, such as doors unlocking by 
   themselves, strange banging noises could be heard on the walls of the 
   room I slept in, and once, rocks seemed to hurl themselves at the 
   house while we were inside watching television.
  </P>
  <P>
   As I grew up, the activities my playmates and I engaged in typically 
   involved the paranormal. Seances became a favorite past-time, 
   although we never really who knew who to conjure up. So when a good 
   friend tragically died at the tender age of 13, it was natural for me 
   to initiate a seance to try and contact this dear and deeply missed friend.
  </P>
  <P>
   Three girlfriends and I gathered together on a hot summer day, in the 
   middle of the afternoon, to conduct the seance. We decided it was 
   silly to try to have a seance in broad daylight, so we lit candles 
   and formed a tight circle in my parents' walk-in closet. It was 
   totally dark in there, and the shadows cast by the candles made for 
   an eerie atmosphere. We got freaked out and decided that total 
   darkness was not necessarily a prerequisite for a good seance. We 
   adjourned back to my room where we opened the curtains wide to let 
   the Florida sunshine spill in. The door to my bedroom was closed, my 
   mother was outside weeding her garden, my father and brother were off 
   somewhere together. We were alone in the house.
  </P>
  <P>
   We resumed our circle, knees touching, hands joined. We stared into 
   the candle flames for a few minutes, and I felt myself fall into some 
   sort of a mild trance. The other girls stared at me reverently and 
   clasped hands more tightly. Something was happening to the air around 
   us. It felt like it was getting charged up with electricity.
  </P>
  <P>
   I made up some mumbo jumbo about asking the spirits to join us, to 
   please be with us and protect us as crossed into the unknown world of 
   death, et cetera. After I had gone on for a few minutes with this 
   type of monologue I said, in all seriousness, &quot;We ask that the 
   spirit of (friend's name) join us now, we wish to speak to her.&quot;
  </P>
  <P>
   What happened next surprised and scared the living daylights out of 
   all of us. (Despite our belief in and respect for the paranormal, we 
   were, after all, just a bunch of kids.) A heaviness had descended 
   over the room like a blanket, making it difficult for me to breathe. 
   The temperature in the room dropped suddenly, so abruptly and so 
   sharply that I got chill bumps on my arms and legs. The candles 
   flickered as if from a slight breeze. Then there was a noise like 
   someone had knocked something off the dresser, something heavy. And 
   there was a presence there beside the dresser, right where the noise 
   had been. We could feel someone there, watching us through that veil 
   that separates life from death. We all looked in that direction for a 
   few seconds, half-expecting a complete materialization of the spirit 
   who had made the noise. One of the girls asked, in a shaky voice, 
   &quot;what was that noise?&quot;.
  </P>
  <P>
   And total pandemonium set in.
  </P>
  <P>
   The girls and I ran out of the house like it had been set on fire. We 
   crossed the street to one of the girls' homes and, in a flurry of 
   adolescent exuberance, told her mother what had happened. The mother 
   was a highly religious type who scolded us for conjuring up the 
   spirits of the dead. There were some things, she said, that should 
   just be left alone. Outwardly I agreed but in my mind I scoffed. The 
   spirits are here, anyway, why not converse with them?
  </P>
  <P>
   When I went back to my room that night, I had wax to clean up off the 
   carpet because in our haste to get out of there, we had left the 
   candles burning. After I was finished, I stood in the space that the 
   spirit had occupied that afternoon. I did not feel afraid. The spirit 
   had been the spirit of my friend, and she had entered my room by 
   invitation after all. I was happy that she had taken the time to 
   visit me, and I said so to the empty room, hoping that she could hear me.
