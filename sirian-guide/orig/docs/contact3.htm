   The ship took off again. The next stop took a little bit longer but 
   it was just a matter of seconds. However, it took a lot less seconds 
   for the extra-terrestrials to open the door than when they picked up 
   the second kid.
  </P>
  <P>
   The man and woman said, &quot;We are going to go get another 
   friend.&quot; They were gone longer this time. It seemed to take a 
   few minutes but it was difficult to tell time.
  </P>
  <P>
   When the extra-terrestrial man and woman returned, they had a teenage 
   girl with them. This girl, I'd never seen before either. She had 
   blond hair, white blond hair.
  </P>
  <P>
   The second boy knew her but I didn't. This was the first time I had 
   heard a name call out because the second boy said, &quot;Hi, 
   ------&quot; and she said, &quot;Hi ------.&quot; There were no 
   emotions; everyone was just &quot;there.&quot;
  </P>
  <P>
   The teenage girl had on her pajamas which I didn't understand because 
   me and the other kid were dressed in regular clothes. However, this 
   teenager had on pajamas and bedroom shoes.
  </P>
  <P>
   Even though the other boy knew the teenager, they didn't carry on a 
   conversation. It seemed to me like the experience was familiar 
   routine to her. She appeared to be more interested in where we were 
   going. She sat down on the right side of the ship. When the ship took 
   off, she asked the extra-terrestrials to turn the floor on which they 
   did. This was in that 1 foot deep depression in the center of the 
   ship. You could seen the ground moving below. Although it was night 
   outside, everything was evenly illuminated. The closest description I 
   can give to the appearance of the illumination was what I have seen 
   of current night vision technology. However, this was vastly superior.
  </P>
  <P>
   Where we were going next took a little longer. I could tell we were 
   going to land because they always turned off the floor viewer before 
   they landed. So they turned off the floor, landed and the man and 
   woman got out once again.
  </P>
  <P>
   They returned with another teenage girl. This one was a little 
   younger than the first with red hair. She was wearing a red blouse 
   and black skirt. She didn't say anything to anyone and no one said 
   anything to her. She went and sat down on the right side of the ship 
   with the other older girl. Ironically, 20 years later, this girl was 
   to become my wife.
  </P>
  <P>
   Apparently, the red haired girl was real familiar with this 
   extra-terrestrial experience also. I seemed to be the neophyte as the 
   others appeared to know each other. This girl was more interested in 
   the controls of the ship than anything else. She had set in the set 
   closest to the control console.
  </P>
  <P>
   I just sat there looking around. I'd look at the TV monitor, I'd look 
   at the floor view which was turned back on, just taking in the entire 
   scene. However, it was like we were all on sedation. Even though the 
   ship had taken off again, there was no sensation of movement. 
   Apparently when they reached a certain point after take off, they 
   would turn the floor viewer back on and you could seen the ground 
   that the ship was passing over.
  </P>
  <P>
   It was apparent this time that the ship was higher than it had been 
   because the ground look small, like the scene out of an airliner 
   window. Everything looked tiny on the ground.
  </P>
  <P>
   We must have been traveling North because we reached a point where I 
   could see snow on the ground. It wasn't blanketed but there were 
   patches of it.
  </P>
  <P>
   It took us longer to get to where the extra-terrestrials picked up 
   the next person. The only indicator of the passage of time was the 
   moving scenery on the floor viewer or the flat panel console screen. 
   It seems that the console screen also echoed what was happening on 
   the ground. There was some other things like writing on the screen 
   from time to time that changed; they were strange characters. It 
   reminds me today of what I've seen of range finder binoculars that 
   superimpose readouts on the viewer.
  </P>
  <P>
   Once again, the floor viewer was turned off and the ship landed. 
   Shortly, the man and woman extra-terrestrial got up and exited the 
   ship. I could see snow through the door.
  </P>
  <P>
   The extra-terrestrials returned with another woman. This woman seemed 
   to be a little older than everyone else. Perhaps 22 or 23. Anyway, it 
   was another person that I didn't know.
  </P>
  <P>
   They were wearing a coat; the quilted type that was well padded. They 
   also had snow bottoms on. No one introduced themselves. Everyone was 
   just there and very tranquil.
  </P>
  <P>
   The door disappeared and the ship obviously took off as they turned 
   the floor viewer back on. I enjoyed watching it. The terrain 
   underneath had gotten rugged like big hills and valleys. I guess you 
   would say mountainous terrain.
  </P>
  <P>
   When we picked up this woman, that was the last passenger that night. 
   We were now heading to our destination.
  </P>
  <P>
   The extra-terrestrial craft was flying over an area that reminds me 
   of the Smoky Mountains today. Soon the craft was flying over a big<A HREF="../mtns2.htm"> 
   V type valley</A>. One giant hill on one side and one giant steep 
   hill on the other side. From the air, it looked like it went down 
   into a big V.
  </P>
  <P>
   Then the ship stopped in midair. In the console viewer was a 90 
   degree rock cliff. One of the ship's operators sent some sort of 
   signal; they pushed a sequence of buttons. In the upper left hand 
   screen of the console monitor, a window popped up. Then, on the side 
   of the steep, rocky cliff, a black hole appeared.
  </P>
  <P>
   It didn't look like a hole to me on the monitor, rather it looked 
   like a large black spot. Before the signal was sent, there was 
   terrain. From the air, this black spot looked oval with the elongated 
   part of the oval being towards the top of the hill.
  </P>
  <P>
   The ship started descending and they turned the floor view off. But I 
   could see on the console monitor that they lined up with this black 
   spot and traveled into it. What a surprise!
