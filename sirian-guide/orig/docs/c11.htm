   My night time activity had increased significantly. I was apparently 
   being shown various levels of reality. On three separate occasions, I 
   woke up after having been conscious in an Out of Body Experience but 
   left totally confused by what I had seen. The confusion was so 
   intense, I was actually disoriented to my physical surroundings. The 
   only thing that was certain is that I was UP somewhere and I had to 
   descend to return to my body.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   This confusion was frustrating for me. I wanted to know what was 
   there. So I started programming my subconscious for greater conscious 
   awareness during the OOBEs.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The first result I had was within a few days; I re-entered my body so 
   forcefully, that the bed actually bounced. Also, my mind was a blank 
   as to what happened. My psychological training indicated that I was 
   blocking on something so I worked to find out what I was blocking.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   It took about two days to remember but what had caused me to so 
   forcefully jump back into my body was actually seeing a spirit or 
   entity. This was quite the entity dressed in a shiny black robe with 
   yellow and red trim around the bottom, around the neck and at the end 
   of both long sleeves. He had jet black hair and beard.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I had seen some child astral projections previously without having 
   this reaction so my conclusion was that this was really a spirit and 
   a very powerful one. It was obvious that it was related to my 
   programming to have greater Out of Body awareness of these higher levels.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I wasn't deterred by this incident. I had long ago determined if 
   something was going to get me, it would have already done so. I 
   wanted to know what was at these UPPER levels that I was visiting.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   One night, I had limited success. I became conscious after I had 
   already traveled to these levels. At the moment of consciousness, I 
   KNEW everything. I also knew that I had to quickly get back to my 
   body to write it down.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I literally dove for my body. However, as I started going down, the 
   knowledge began to fade. I was moving very fast and it was fading 
   very fast. I hit my body so hard, the bed bounced and I never lost 
   consciousness. I jumped up, disoriented but able to move, and ran to 
   the paper and pen. All I wrote down was, &quot;21 birds flying.&quot; 
   That was it; that was all I remembered of what had been a magnificent 
   revelation. The knowledge literally disappeared from my mind as I 
   descended to my body. This was in 1977. A few years later, I did 
   discover the significance of 21 but at the time, it didn't mean a 
   thing to me. I was disappointed that I had &quot;lost&quot; some 
   valuable insight.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I continued to program my subconscious for greater conscious 
   awareness during Out of Body Experiences and had a result that I had 
   to read about later to learn what it was.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   During one sleep state, I became conscious. I was still attached to 
   my body although I was mostly out. There was a large pool of reddish 
   orange energy collected at the base of my spine. It was as if I was 
   in two places at once. I was looking down on the experience and part 
   of the experience at the same time.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   This reddish orange energy reminded me of volcanic lava flow and it 
   BURNED! It started moving up my spine, burning like crazy. It was 
   moving slowly like a thick liquid. As it moved higher, it was burning 
   more and hurting.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I was thinking to myself, &quot;What is going on?&quot; &quot;I'm not 
   ready for this!&quot; It had gotten up as far as my solar plexus area 
   when I determined I wasn't ready for whatever this was. With that 
   thought, one I seriously regret by the way, it stopped abruptly and 
   reversed flow until it had recollected at the base of my spine and dissipated.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I was still conscious and still Out of Body but attached. I looked up 
   and saw a friend astrally floating in the room. After I acknowledged 
   their presence, they faded away. I opened my eyes without losing consciousness.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I found out later that it was the Kundalini experience, one that some 
   people work for many years to achieve and most never do. Gopi 
   Krishna's book on the Kundalini explained it well. My regret is that 
   I didn't allow the process to complete. But then, maybe that was as 
   far as it was going to go at the time. I can't really say for sure. 
   What I can say is that if you ever start to experience it, go for it.
