   <FONT SIZE=4>EARTH CHANGES</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Unbeknownst to most of MUNkind, the planet Earth has a 
   rock tube-like structure running from the North pole to the South 
   pole which is analogous to the spinal column within the huMUN. And as 
   the huMUN has centers along the spinal column, so does the planet 
   Earth along its rock tube.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As evolution proceeds, different centers become 
   energized. You are familiar with the many changes a MUN makes as the 
   emphasis in life changes; as when the PATH is ascended. So it is with 
   the Earth. As the planet reaches points of evolutionary advancement, 
   it brings about major changes, such as shifting its energy from a 
   lower center to a higher one. When this occurs, energy within the 
   planet physically shifts its location of concentration and as it 
   radiates out from the new point, the surface area will change 
   accordingly in order to meet the demand for the life expression.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Major catastrophes, e.g. where whole civilizations are 
   mostly wiped out, come when the planet undergoes initiation. When an 
   initiation occurs, wide spread new forms are needed to express higher 
   Spiritual energies that are then available because the old life forms 
   are no longer capable of expressing or handling the higher vibration. 
   Thus, destruction of vast numbers of old forms occur with new forms 
   taking their place.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Such a time is upon you. Sanate Kumara is about to 
   undergo the THIRD Cosmic initiation. (Third as is relative to his 
   class of entity) You will recall that this initiation marks a major 
   increase in Spiritual consciousness. It is the one where upon the 
   SOUL comes in control of the personality. This initiation marks the 
   first initiation that brings in higher energy from an outside source. 
   After this initiation, Earth will become what is referred to as a 
   Spiritual or Esoteric planet. Heretofore, that has definitely not 
   been the case.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>You also recall that the SEVENTH RAY has recently come 
   into power. The SEVENTH RAY governs the center at the base of the 
   spine, which encapsulates the Kundalini. This center is analogous to 
   the South pole. Now recall that the TOP CENTER is sympathetically 
   connected with the base of the spine. Any action on one brings a 
   concomitant response from the other. The results within a huMUN is 
   the drawing of the head backwards to meet the base of the spine, 
   which is then corrected by a downflow of energy into the head from 
   the SOUL or higher levels. To the Earth then, this will mean that 
   there will be forces drawing the North and South poles together until 
   it is offset by an influx of energy from the sun into the North pole. 
   The North pole will then be pulled closer into line with a stream of 
   energy straight from the sun which will result in a physical 
   repositioning of the poles relative to the axis of revolution.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>That means soon, the North pole will have much more 
   affinity for the energy coming from the sun and will seek to position 
   itself into a direct line with it. This line up will not completely 
   occur until the Earth goes through its seventh initiation. So you 
   have a while to go.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Since the Third initiation deals with the mental body 
   and MUNkind, as a whole, makes up the mental vehicle for the planet, 
   you may expect considerable change within the consciousness of 
   MUNkind that will be rapidly reflected within all of MUN's 
   institutions. Therefore, you will have major surface changes and at 
   the same time, MUNkind will experience a tremendous expansion of 
   consciousness ability. The mere influx of this energy into the huMUN 
   organism, taken here as a whole, will render unprepared vehicles dead 
   or insane.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>There has been much stress on the surface changes to be 
   made on the planet and the surviving of them, but there is a greater 
   need for the preparing of huMUN vehicles to cope with this surge of 
   tremendous higher energy.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The surface changes could become moderated if MUN would 
   expand his consciousness to include the planet consciousness, or at 
   least the two could work together to minimize the destruction to MUN. 
   Earth would gladly warn her children of impending changes and how to 
   avoid some. But as it is, it is left to the intuned members of MUN to 
   prepare to handle the expansion of consciousness and to be able to 
   lead the others after the event has occurred. Many that survive the 
   surge will be temporarily blinded by the light. Their bodies and 
   minds will have to be helped. Of course, this presupposes that their 
   will be those who have known what was going to happen, taken 
   appropriate measures to survive and have prepared to serve MUNkind in 
   this fashion. See to it!</FONT>
