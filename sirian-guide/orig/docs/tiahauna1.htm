       [Editor's Note: Tiahuanaco first received wide-spread notice in 1974
       when the NBC network presented the special, In Search of Ancient
       Astronauts. This show was based on <A HREF="../vondaniken.htm" TARGET="_blank">Erich
       Von Daniken's</A>, Chariots of the Gods ?. Von Daniken presented a
       number of ancient sites, vividly present on camera by NBC, that
       suggested that in ancient times, humans had contact with spaceships
       and their inhabitants.

       It is been said that at Tiahuanaco, an advanced race of
       extra-terrestrials genetically engineered Neanderthal man into the
       various races that exist today. Their work was completed 100,000
       years ago.

       In December of 2002, the author of this article went to Tiahuanaco,
       located in the vicinity of Lake Titicaca in Bolivia.]

       For many years I have wanted to go to Peru. There was something about
       the area that called to me. Finally, I started making preparations
       for the trip in the Fall of 2002 with the visit scheduled for
       December; summer in South America. In discussing the upcoming trip
       with a friend, it was asked if I had scheduled a visit to Tiahuanaco.
       I had not since it is located in Bolivia and I had scheduled for
       Peru. However, I contacted the tour company and made the necessary
       arrangements to include a visit to Tiahuanaco. I'm glad that I did
       because it was the most meaningful experience of the entire trip.

           Tiahuanaco is located in a sparsely populated, mountainous region
           east of the southern part of Lake Titicaca on a toll road that goes
           from La Paz, Bolivia to Desaguaradero, Peru . There is nothing around
           it for many miles.

       At Tiahuanaco, I documented several electromagnetic anomalies with a compass.

       One anomaly was at a structure called the Akapana Pyramid. I climbed
       the seven levels of the ruin which was in the process of being
       excavated. It had a large pool at the top from which my guide said
       ancient astronomers studied the stars from reflections in the pool.
       Only on one side could we get close to the rim. This was the first
       spot where I noticed an electromagnetic change. The needle of my
       compass was about 40 degrees off the determined location of North
       when checked at the center point on the part of the observation rim
       that was accessible. The affect, to a lesser degree, was present at
       all points along that rim.

       A short distance from the Akapana Pyramid, there was a very
       intriguing structure. It was a large basement - like room well below
       the current ground level. It was about the size of two basketball
       courts. It was about eight feet below ground level. There was one set
       of stairs about ten feet wide with about eight rather deep steps. The
       walls were about eighteen inches thick.
      </P>
      <P>
       In the center of the room, there were three monoliths. A tall one
       with two smaller, same sized monoliths on either side.
      </P>
      <P>
       The most interesting part of this room was that all along the walls
       were heads sticking out of the wall! About every 3 feet there was a
       new head! The human heads were representing the facial features of
       races of people from all over the current world! The guide pointed
       out two heads that Thor Hyadahl said also represented the skulls of aliens.

       It was impressive to me to see facial features of people from all
       over the world represented in a wall assumed to be over 5,000 years
       old. It certainly made me think that the builders may have had
       contacts with people from other parts of the universe also when I saw
       those two heads that were alien-looking. I saw many places where I
       thought the stone had been stripped of ornamentation because of flat,
       bare places on the faces of some of the stone protruding occupants in
       this area. In its original form, the room must have been spectacular!
      </P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       To say in that era that builders had contact with people from all
       over the world and perhaps outside of this solar system, and then say
       they were so primitive that they had to make blueprints out of stone,
       move stone without the wheel, cut and fit stone walls perfectly
       without adequate tools seemed to be a contradiction. Most of the
       workmanship at this site was very intricate, not primitive by modern
       standards. I was uncomfortable with the assumption that the people
       who built this basement of heads were primitive!
      </P>

       Further evidence of the Tiahuanaco people's familiarity with the
       various races of the Earth was presented in a number of museums at
       the archeological site containing local artifacts from many different
       time periods. There was ancient pottery on display that also had
       faces of every human nationality known to us now ! One could discern
       Middle Eastern faces, African faces, European faces, faces like the
       current local inhabitants and every other human race that I am aware
       of. How did an ancient race, thousands of feet above sea level in a
       land locked country know what all the other races of Earth looked like?

       Another significant structure at Tiahuanaco was the Door of the Sun.
       It is a famous stone carving in the shape of a doorway. Above the
       doorway, are four rows of carvings attributed with various meanings
       by modern theorists.

       About twenty feet to the left of the Door of the Sun, I had my most
       exciting moment. I walked up to a large black stone that seemed to
       have no particular reason to be there. My guide did not call
       attention to it but I stopped and got out my compass. I was more
       interested in it than the Door of the Sun, the main attraction! I
       felt an excitement about being close to the flat black rock and
       wanted to stand on it. It felt very good to stand on it. Usually the
       guide did not want me to encroach on special sites but he had no
       reaction to my standing on this rock. My compass gave vastly
       different readings at different points on its surface. The most
       outstanding reading was exactly <B>180 degrees</B> wrong for due
       north! The electromagnetic strength of the spot was the most amazing
       I have ever seen. It was, by outward appearances, nothing special but
       inwardly, emotionally, I felt like that rock was the most important
       thing I had seen on my trip. The atmosphere and altitude of the place
       was not appealing to me emotionally but that rock was as magnetic to
       me as it was to my compass! I would have liked to spend more time on
       that rock. I would like to know what part it played in ancient Tiahuanaco.

       My trip to South America was my &quot;dream vacation&quot;. I do not
       really know why I had to go but I did. No one I know has every
       traveled to South America but that did not even slow me down. I did
       not speak adequate Spanish but that did not stop me. It meant going
       alone but I went anyway. I DID need some help so a tourist agency
       planned my accommodations, some meals, English speaking guides and
       transportation. Going on this trip, I found that I needed some
       special services but the expense was less than I though because of
       the comparatively high value of the dollar there.

       It was unforgettable. It was like arriving at Mt. Everest. TIAHUANACO
       was there and so was I !
