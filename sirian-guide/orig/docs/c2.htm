   I didn't know I had the ability to perceive that people were about to 
   die but discovered it by accident. At the place where I worked, the 
   supervisor in charge of the department was very nice. Mr. X was 
   actually the nicest guy to me of all the people at that job. He was 
   an older fellow and had some children my age that were attending the 
   same university as me. Thus, he was always initiating friendly 
   conversations about my college studies and future plans.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   As the summer progressed, I suddenly found myself being uncomfortable 
   around Mr. X. There was no reason for it. He was actually the only 
   person at that entire job that was nice to me and he was a great guy. 
   However, it reached the point where I found myself avoiding him. This 
   was illogical to me but I couldn't help myself. However, I didn't 
   have to avoid him for too many days.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   One afternoon, another employee stopped in and was making polite 
   conversation. In the course of the conversation he said, &quot;Well, 
   Mr. X is no longer with us.&quot; I was surprised and asked if he'd 
   quit. I was told no, that the previous night, Mr. X had died of a 
   heart attack at his home.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I was taken aback but the implications of this became immediately 
   apparent. The reason this very nice guy was making me uncomfortable 
   related to my perception of his impending death. I pondered this 
   situation and decided that it was a handy ability to have. At least, 
   you wouldn't be caught by surprise when a relative died. Thus, I was 
   not concerned about the heart problems that my father developed about 
   the same time because I KNEW he was not going to die immediately. 
   And, it was true. He survived that series of heart attacks and lived 
   for another 19 years.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   This ability has remained with me since the time I discovered I could 
   do it. As with most things in my life, I didn't view it as anything special.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The summer ended, my father got out of the hospital and I went back 
   to college. However, something was very different. My entire 
   curriculum choice became a hopeless nightmare. I discovered that my 
   career choice was derailed. I became depressed. That was a rough 
   school term for me and I was glad when it was over. However, you have 
   to pre-register for the next term and I had signed up for courses 
   that had once been my goal and decided that I would use the Christmas 
   break to figure things out.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Unfortunately, my mind was a blank and strangely enough, I couldn't 
   see an alternative. I knew I had to make a change but I didn't know 
   what it needed to be. But several days before it was time to go back 
   to school, an unusual thing happened.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I woke up feeling out of sorts. I had a fever but there were no other 
   symptoms. I didn't think too much of it and took some aspirin. 
   However, it didn't do any good and by that afternoon my fever had 
   escalated. By the next day, it was around 105 degrees. I never felt 
   so rotten in my life. My head was pounding with my heart beat. The 
   aspirin did very little to reduce the fever. By the late afternoon, 
   the fever continued in the 105 to 107 degree range. The local doctor 
   was called and he prescribed some medication that was picked up from 
   the hospital that evening. When I got it, I simply popped the large 
   pill in my mouth and swallowed it. I couldn't taste anything. A few 
   hours later, the fever began to go down but it wasn't until the next 
   day that I could taste the medicine I had been taking; penicillin. It 
   tasted awful.&amp;#2;
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   In that two days, I had lost about 20 pounds and was a physical 
   wreck. Returning to school was out of the question as I could barely 
   walk, much less drive 300 miles back to the university. So by some 
   strange force, as I say I never had ANY symptoms other than a 
   seriously high fever, I was prevented from returning to college. This 
   forced vacation led to an aspect of myself I had never known.
