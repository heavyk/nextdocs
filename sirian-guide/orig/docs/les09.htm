   <FONT SIZE=4>THE THIRD RAY TRIAD</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It remains for us to describe the THIRD and SEVENTH RAY 
   triads: but first let us illustrate what the THIRD RAY is to the 
   function of the other two. This is best done by geometry, which 
   speaks to the ABSTRACT MIND.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Draw two equal circles so that the circumference of each 
   goes through the center point of the other.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Notice that the THIRD RAY is referred to as the lunar 
   sphere, sphere of action, multiplicity of the one, and the realm 
   where the only constant is change - which all relates to the work of 
   manas or mind.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The THIRD RAY divides the power of the FIRST into 
   manifold creations. Its subsidiaries, the FIFTH and SEVENTH makes the 
   forms and binds the life to the form respectively.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The THIRD RAY is the great categorizor, the FIFTH RAY is 
   the master craftsmen, and the SEVENTH RAY is the Magus (so called 
   because he relates unseen things to the visible form). Hence he is 
   called magician only due to ignorance of the laws that govern his work.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The FOURTH RAY, sitting as it does midpoint within the 
   seven, acts as the balance point, and point of equilibrium. They make 
   superb artist, for any art, and they are the great Law Keepers or 
   Lords of Karma.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>All of the above; the organizers, law keepers, master 
   craftsmen and magicians are divisions of the THIRD RAY - Intellect in 
   action; that action is at once in form and concerns form.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The THIRD RAY triad we have given you as Venus, Tahuti 
   and Saturn. The name of Venus in Atlantis was Unessa. She was precise 
   organization. The affairs of the THIRD RAY department worked like 
   silk with her interjection of energy. Her personality was calm and 
   peaceful and she radiated security. She arrived on earth in a vehicle 
   like Ra's, consequently she too glowed. Unessa was exquisite of form 
   and grace as you would expect a THIRD RAY to be. She personified 
   divine intellect smoothly working amongst form.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Tahuti, SEVENTH RAY master magician, was feared and 
   envied by humanity. They simply could not understand his knowledge 
   and abilities. Humanity became greatly dependent upon him. He arrived 
   upon earth within an almost human type vehicle, except it had evolved 
   among beings that dwelled in underground cities which resulted in 
   very white skin and large blue eyes. Tahuti still lives in legends 
   about Thoth and Hermes. You will note that all magical sciences are 
   referred to as Hermetic Orders.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Saturn, FOURTH RAY, Keeper of the Law; particularly the 
   laws of karma. Note that he does not make the laws or judge but 
   administers them. Saturn in Atlantis was called Dwul Quin. His job 
   within the group was to see that all was done according to laws that 
   best suited the purpose. Dwul Quin arrived on earth in the vehicle 
   descended from a pterodactyl type bird. His skin was gray and eyes 
   were beryl ringed with amber. He was a quiet, somber creature taking 
   his serious job very seriously. Needless to say, his looks nor 
   personality endeared him to humanity, so much so, that when humanity 
   chose a creature to represent their devil they picked Dwul Quin, 
   alias Saturn-Satan.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>SEVENTH TRIAD</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The SEVENTH and FIRST RAYs cause the greatest scandals, 
   splashes and uproar among all the other rayed beings, who are more 
   satisfied with the ordinary, the routine and the natural slow 
   progress of evolution. While the SEVENTH RAY sumptuously entertains 
   and is amusing, the FIRST RAY is merely feared due to 
   misunderstanding and their role as destroyer.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The SEVENTH RAY can create illusions for everyone to 
   see; the FIRST RAY can give life to the illusion and make it an 
   illusion no more - but alive. The SEVENTH RAY is jovial, gallant and 
   entertaining, but the FIRST RAY is seriously deadly or deadly serious.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Why the comparison? Because the FIRST and SEVENTH are 
   ALPHA and OMEGA; two sides of the same thing; the serpent swallowing 
   its tail. Naturally they work well together even though their 
   personalities are vastly different. The SEVENTH RAY seeks the power 
   of the FIRST in order to empower its forms. Or a SEVENTH RAY warrior 
   working with a FIRST RAY female can wield energy as if he were a 
   FIRST RAY thus becoming a &quot;mighty&quot; warrior.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Genxicat, SEVENTH RAY female, is known as the 
   enchantress for her capacity to manipulate the minds of humunity and 
   entertain males. Telepathy is a strong point for this creature. She 
   arrived on this planet in an undefined body structure because she 
   could rearrange her form as needed. When assuming a human form, she 
   usually chose to have long black hair, indigo eyes and to be tall and 
   slender. But she was equally at home in the form of a black panther 
   or a condor. Around a male she naturally would assume the form of his dreams.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Volcrum, FIFTH RAY male, was master craftsmen; the ideal 
   engineer. If some one could come up with an idea, he could build it. 
   Thorough, exacting within his work, yet gentle with all life. He to 
   was admired by humunity and lives today within the legends of Vulcan. 
   Due to peculiar circumstances, Volcrum arrived here wearing the body 
   of an android which had been designed by Schekamet and built by 
   himself. Therefore, it looked very human. He personifies the capacity 
   of the divine architect or artificer.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Allayandra, SEVENTH RAY male, master matter manipulator 
   and warrior. Why did they bring a master warrior? Because all was not 
   peace within &quot;Ourtown&quot;. There were aliens of the same 
   origin that opposed everything that was done by this group. Therein 
   lies the great mystery and purpose of Earth and its Humunity.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Allayandra was created by the same triad that made 
   Schekamet and Teonakaeean. There was much closeness and rapport 
   between the three. Their minds were interconnected. Allayandra 
   arrived in a body from the hawk-bird family. He too had a healthy 
   wing span but whereas his brother, Teonakaeean, is a bird of love and 
   peace, Allayandra's looks are those of a bird of prey. His colors 
   were at times those of camouflage. At other times he was a bird of 
   many bright colors; all of which were on fire; a spectacular 
   creature. He personified divine protection of the creators purpose 
   for its creations.</FONT>
