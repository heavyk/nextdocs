   <FONT SIZE=4>LESSON TWO</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=3>PLEASE REMEMBER</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The theories of cosmology, that we give to you, form a 
   model to serve as a frame of reference for this work. The model is 
   never to be viewed as scientific fact or to become any sort of dogma. 
   It can serve as a reality that will allow you to escape all 
   boundaries. Objective or scientific proof of this model may occur 
   someday, however, such proof is not our objective - nor yours.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=3>NOTE</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>For too long humanity has ignored half of itself - the 
   receptive or female half. The English language is notorious for 
   avoiding acknowledgment of the female. We find this intolerable for 
   our purposes. Instead of having to use the cumbersome term human 
   (which still pays deference to the male) or the term humankind; we 
   would like to use the word MUN. This is a short word with no 
   discrimination attached for the ANTI-SELF to use against you. Thank you.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=3>MUN'S RESPONSIBILITY TO THE INCARNATING SELF!</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As a MUN, you must recognize that you are divine and 
   that you are one with every thing. Due to oneness, your main 
   responsibility to the whole is your own evolutionary development. 
   That is your responsibility in the physical plane. The ONE, or whole, 
   evolves by having many different parts of which you are one. The 
   apparent separateness is to allow specialization.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>MUN has been taught modesty, SELF-denial, and 
   subjugation of SELF to others wishes and desires. This is necessary 
   when MUN is first incarnating and learning to control and overcome 
   the animal passions caused by the elementals of the vehicles which 
   form the ANTI-SELF. This is a service to the elementals. However, 
   evolution requires transcending, rather than just controlling, the 
   limitations of the vehicles. When MUN has stepped onto the Path of 
   return to SELF, as all of you have, your duty is to the PURPOSE for 
   which SELF incarnated.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>On the Path, MUN has to learn to love SELF and respect 
   SELF's objectives. In finding the true SELF, you will find Unity with 
   all for SELF is one.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=3>RESPONSIBILITY OF SELF</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>These responsibilities are:</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>1. Love, respect, and consideration of SELF in every 
   aspect of your life.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>2. To align and harmonize all vehicles to Self.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>3. To actively pursue connections with SELF leading to 
   continuity of consciousness. In continuity of consciousness, you are 
   aware of all levels, or planes, of activity. All these are under 
   conscious control.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Responsibility one is accomplished by much deprogramming 
   and learning the techniques of &quot;Affirmative Thought&quot;. This 
   is training of the emotional and concrete mind.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Responsibility two is accomplished by identification and 
   communing with Self; to be an ongoing accomplishment in the 
   meditation process.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Number three is consciously built, by the personality, 
   using the methods of construction we will give you within the 
   meditations. It involves coordinating the centers, then building 
   these connections all the way to the Monad. It is a long journey but 
   perfection of such a goal is always worth the effort.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=3>PREPARING THE BODY</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When undertaking a program wherein a person will 
   ultimately learn to manipulate energy consciously on the physical 
   plane, whether it is to heal or spread will-to-good, the physical 
   vehicle should be prepared to handle the energy. Otherwise, the body 
   could become unnecessarily uncomfortable.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The body is made from and uses five groups of elementals 
   corresponding to the five elements: Fire, Earth, Air, Water, and 
   Akasha. It is important to learn to assimilate these five 
   efficiently. This will be presented in more detail later.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>DIET = EARTH</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>See to your changing dietary needs, for the nutrients 
   that the body will need will change as you progress. There will be 
   certain vitamins, minerals and proteins that you will need in excess 
   from time to time. There are plenty of books and people within the 
   group that can help you out with this, if needed.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>WATER = WATER</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Water is a very important ingredient for anyone 
   harnessing their fires. Drink lots of water, preferably that which 
   has been treated within a pyramid, energy collector or sat in the sun 
   with an iron rod or large magnet by it. This is so it will collect 
   the PRANA and CH'I that has been processed out of it.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Remember the origins of life on this planet - the sea. 
   It is good and cooling to the fires if you visit the oceans dipping 
   yourself in them if you can. They have healing properties for your 
   physical and the rhythm of the waves are soothing to the astral. 
   PRANA and CH'I are drawn to the oceans.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>BREATHING = AIR</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>BREATHING - so amazing and important a function, is 
   little emphasized here in the West - so far. How you Breathe is 
   important. Proper breathing will allowing your physical vehicle to 
   handle higher vibrations. Air not only supplies oxygen, but is the 
   carrier of CH'I. CH'I is the vital energy that fuels your nerve 
   currents and travels major avenues or meridians within the body. It 
   collects around and just over the heart center. This energy can be 
   consciously directed out the hands to heal.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We have chosen to use the words PRANA and CH'I to 
   represent two different energies even though some people use them to 
   mean the same thing. PRANA is the vital fluid from the planet that is 
   assimilated by the spleen center. CH'I is the vital energy received 
   from the sun. It is assimilated by two centers that have no names in 
   your system. One is located just below your solar plexus and the 
   other just above your heart center between the shoulder blades.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Breathing techniques combined with some asanas 
   (postures) can greatly aid the body to gather and assimilate its CH'I 
   and PRANA. Later we will combine the above two with slow movement in 
   order to impress harmony upon the three lower vehicles. It will be the</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>movements of fire.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>EXERCISE or the ASANAS</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>First let's develop your abdominal muscles. Learn the 
   backward stretch laying down and standing up.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>For breathing stand with your knees slightly bent, 
   exhale strongly and move your abdominal muscles in and out about five 
   times before you breathe back in. Learn to do this about three times 
   in a row. It is essential to gain control of your abdominal muscles 
   for the control of CH'I.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Fire and Akasha will be discussed later.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=3>THE SEPTENARY PLANE MODEL</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The planes may be considered seven rarefications of 
   substance, or energy, differentiated by the sounding of a keynote and 
   held stable by the continuing vibration of that sound's tonic chord. 
   The planes are presented from top to bottom.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>First plane: influenced by first ray. This is the plane 
   of the entity that informs the whole system. It is called LOGOIC. 
   Logos is a Greek word for God.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Second plane: influenced by the second ray. This is the 
   plane on which the Monad is anchored in this system. Therefore it is 
   called MONADIC.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Third plane: influenced by third ray. This is the plane 
   on which the Monad first projects its will. It is the first 
   differentiation of the Monad's will downward for the purpose of 
   manifestation. It is called ATMIC, a sanskrit word meaning the Higher Self.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Fourth plane: responds to the fourth ray. This is the 
   plane on which the Monad projects its second aspect for 
   manifestation. It is also the plane of balance. It is called by some 
   the BUDHIC plane which means plane of enlightenment.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Fifth plane: responds to the fifth ray. A very important 
   plane for humans. It is the plane on which the monad projects its 
   unit of Manas called MIND or intellect. It holds the mental unit of 
   the Monad called the Abstract Mind. It also holds the veil or vortex 
   commonly called SOUL. It also contains the concrete mind of the 
   physicalized human. This is the third aspect for the incarnating 
   human unit. It's aptly called MENTAL plane.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Sixth plane: responds to the sixth ray. It is called 
   ASTRAL. It contains the second aspect of the incarnating MUN called 
   its astral or emotional vehicle.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Seventh plane: responds to the seventh ray. It is called 
   the PHYSICAL plane and is where the etheric and physical vehicles reside.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Each plane has seven subplanes that are analogous to the 
   seven planes.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Here are some tabulations to help you relate all this.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=3>PLANES</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>1st - is will, vibration - LOGOIC</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>2nd - is attraction, radiation, consciousness - MONADIC</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>3rd - is discrimination, akasha - ATMIC</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>4th - color, fire, diffraction, intuition - BUDDHIC</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>5th - air - MENTAL</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>6th - is liquid - ASTRAL</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>7th - is solid - PHYSICAL</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=3>SUBPLANES</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>1st - Vibration. The primary impulse that instills 
   information in the substance. &quot;The program&quot; code. The signal.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>2nd - Light. This is &quot;at-one-ment&quot; without the 
   use of a discriminating faculty.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>3rd - Sound. This is discrimination by vibration.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>4th - color. This is &quot;refraction&quot;; 
   differentiation harmoniously held together. Separation unseparated. A 
   saturated solution of all possibilities unprecipitated.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>5th - air. This is &quot;repulsion&quot;; like repelling like.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>6th - liquid. Liquid is the &quot;solid state&quot; 
   without the crystalline properties; rather that of adaptability.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>7th - Solid. Solid is as gross and filled with inertia, 
   which means that its substance has the greatest crystalline 
   attraction for itself, as the relevant keynote can hold in its 
   attractive field.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>You will notice that what can be said of the planes can 
   be analogously used for the subplanes, and vice versa.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Don't let all the details overwhelm you. They can be 
   learned over time by frequent referral.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=3>DEVELOPMENT OF ETHERIC VISION</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>1. Take the thumb of the right hand and message between 
   the eyebrows. Thrice daily.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>2. Sitting comfortably with eyes partly closed, roll the 
   eyes backward until they are focused on the area between the eyebrows 
   keeping the eyes partly open. This may put a strain on the eye 
   muscles at first, so do it only as long as the muscles are 
   comfortable. This is also good for developing eye muscle control.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>There are other methods for this that will be added as 
   you progress.</FONT>
