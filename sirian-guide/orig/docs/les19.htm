   <FONT SIZE=3>The ATMIC plane is the third plane and as such, is the 
   receiver of the third aspects energy from without this system. This 
   is the first plane we have studied that represents an Aspect of Divinity.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The vehicle there, for the MONAD, is analogous to the 
   physical for the SOUL, and yet it is the antithesis of physical 
   existence. Where the physical is limited to one location at a time, 
   the ATMIC realizes omnipresence; where the physical thinks linearly, 
   the ATMIC uses circular thought whose center is everywhere and 
   circumference is nowhere.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This is the plane of Nirvana. The above explanation of 
   the differences of physical and ATMIC reality is why some have 
   referred to it as annihilation. The ATMIC, being the lowest plane 
   that FIRST RAY energy from outside the Solar System can penetrate, is 
   where both ends of paradoxes are equally true. The entity is equally 
   aware of individuality, as he is of oneness with all there is.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The ATMIC is a wondrous dynamic plane. The MONAD sends 
   into the ATMIC vehicle its FIRST RAY energy activating its purpose 
   and executing its will from that point.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Upon this plane man becomes a god among gods.</FONT>
