   <FONT SIZE=4>CONTINUITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Since you have begun to build the connection from the 
   lower MIND to the higher MIND which will eventually lead to the 
   conscious awareness of the MONAD and its faculties, we must address 
   the issue of CONTINUITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS. You may comment that 
   CONTINUITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS sounds great and it is but let us inspect 
   what it really means and the responsibilities it incurs.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As you are now, when you lay down to sleep you 
   experience an absence of physical consciousness. This allows you to 
   get away from everyday trivia and troubles in order to just rest. 
   Meanwhile, your other vehicles can take advantage of having more 
   energy to go about their tasks unhampered by the emotional and mental 
   drains that the physical has on all of the equipment. Most of these 
   nonphysical experiences have elements within them that the physical 
   consciousness does not relate to and after the connection of the 
   ABSTRACT MIND almost all of them are incomprehensible to the 
   uneducated physical consciousness - hence your study of symbols.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Upon adding CONTINUITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS, you no longer 
   have the escape of sleeping oblivion. You will still be sleeping but 
   your consciousness will be directed to many other states of activity. 
   Due to this, you must have a a great degree of self-control and 
   self-identity. Conscious control of our actions goes along with 
   controlling our emotional body. For a long time we may not be able to 
   deaden our emotions to where they are what we want them to be but we 
   can make a lot of headway with controlling our reactions to the 
   emotions we feel.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In this system and within its equipment, control of 
   speech is the hardest problem to be solved before CONTINUITY OF 
   CONSCIOUSNESS is permitted. Speech is the switch or &quot;on&quot; 
   button to activate the elementals of the physical plane. When you 
   speak, they vibrate around you to the pattern of the content and 
   intent of the statement. That is why a great deal of idle chatter has 
   such possibilities for negation within it.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Also, speech releases energy. Every time you talk, you 
   are using some of your energy potential. Have you ever noticed that a 
   conversation can be tiring? Have you ever noticed that upon 
   immediately talking about a new idea, it becomes aborted? It can and 
   often does. The reason is its premature &quot;birth&quot; upon the 
   physical. Ideas have a gestation period upon the MENTAL and ASTRAL 
   planes before they can safely be released into speech. This is why 
   magicians were schooled in silence. If a person could not learn to 
   control his tongue, he was not initiated.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>That is also the reason Toth is most often pictured with 
   his fingers to his lips, meaning: the seal of silence or the 
   knowledge and the ability to know when and what to speak.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Now we know that most of you are SECOND RAYS, that you 
   are in a SECOND RAY system, that you are social beings, that you 
   spend a great deal of your social endeavors in relating and that a 
   lot of verbal communication seems necessary. We suggest that you 
   become aware of the quality of your speech patterns. An absolute must 
   for the SECOND RAY is a habit of &quot;affirmative or Positive&quot; 
   speech. This fills several needs: e.g. it gathers elementals of 
   affirmative action around your physical which in turn affects all of 
   your actions on the physical and how others react to you; it brings 
   into your aura elementals that can move in a progressive manner. 
   Putting it differently, success and accomplishment becomes a habit 
   for that is all you have within your equipment. This in turn allows 
   you to think and feel much, much better about yourself. If ones feels 
   great about himself, he is much more compassionate and tolerant of 
   others. This then frees you from the negative emotional and mental 
   stresses that cause your consciousness to have the need for 
   recuperation within &quot;the sleep of oblivion&quot;. Thus you can 
   deal with CONTINUITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Practice making affirmative statements. Even if you do 
   not like something, remain aloof; detached; keeping all emotion out 
   of it. Analyze an idea or situation with the rational, concrete mind. 
   You should never reason with the emotions!!! If you are asked for an 
   opinion, first give your evaluation which comes from mental analysis. 
   Usually opinions are personal prejudices and therefore not of much 
   value. Abstain from presenting opinions and give evaluations instead. 
   Many, many times you will find that an evaluation is inconclusive due 
   to lack of physical, objective evidence. Don't hesitate to say that 
   you don't know something or that you don't have all the answers - 
   they aren't reachable on the physical anyway. Also, allow for the 
   persons evolutionary state. What is good at one point in evolution 
   could become no more than a crutch at another point.....</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>All observations concerning associates should be stated 
   with detachment and a concern for the person's evolution; never in 
   the context of idle gossip or to put the other person down. Also, as 
   you tread the path, your statements will carry much more energy. So 
   guard the intent of your statements about someone least you 
   inadvertently cause them harm or discomfort.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In summation: a prerequisite for CONTINUITY OF 
   CONSCIOUSNESS is to be able to maintain an affirmative aura. The 
   largest obstacle to accomplishing this positive aura is found in the 
   patterns of speech. In order for this to become habitual, it is of 
   great assistance to practice seeing the positive; hearing the 
   positive; thinking the positive. This does not mean that you deny 
   that the negative is there; that amounts to the deliberate delusion 
   of self which is an absurdity. Instead always give more stress to the 
   affirmative because the negative is the line of least resistance 
   since it is inherent in matter. [Matter was imbrued with it in the 
   previous life wave where the negative was then the positive]. 
   Therefore, acquiring the habit of affirmation requires more effort 
   and energy than to simply float down stream with the negation.......</FONT>
