   <FONT SIZE=3>[EDITOR'S NOTE: THE FOLLOWING IS A VERBATIM TRANSCRIPT 
   FROM THE SESSION TAPE. WORDS ADDED FOR CLARITY WILL BE IN<B> [ ],</B> 
   WORDS OMITTED WILL BE DENOTED BY <B>.....</B> THE REST IS JUST AS IT 
   WAS SPOKEN]</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This is Higgins of the development committee. Tonight we 
   are beginning to broadcast information that we feel will be of great 
   use to each individual, and people in general, in the future.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Tonight's message involves three elements. The first 
   element is <B>fear</B>, the second element is <B>disharmony</B>, and 
   the third element is <B>disunity</B>.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3><B>Fear</B> leads to <B>disharmony</B> which leads to <B>disunity</B>.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3><B>Fear</B> manifests itself in various forms and some 
   do not view it for what it is. Some of the forms that it presents 
   itself: doubts of self, anxiety, denial, worry, and shortsightedness. 
   All of these are <B>fear</B> motivated. All of these create 
   artificial boundaries that put you in a self-imposed prison. And this 
   is what we have been referring to in the past when we talked of <B>fear</B>.
    You have to recognize it as such. You have to look at the denial. 
   You have to look at the worry; the anxiety. This leads to <B>disharmony</B>.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3><B>Disharmony</B> is when the various portions of the 
   MIND are out of balance. This results in a great inefficient use of 
   the energies; blockages; disruptions; side-effects; leading to 
   instability. This instability has stopped many people from following 
   the <B>PATH</B> for discovery of SELF.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And it seems that the people who have the greatest 
   capacity for the energies are the most affected for it is easy for 
   them to be thrown out of balance. This weak spot has been exploited 
   down through the ages by the dark forces. This conflict within SELF; 
   the doubts, the disbelief of SELF; has thrown a wedge in between many 
   sensitive people resulting in the <B>disunity</B>.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The very people who could join together, combine forces, 
   for the enlightenment of mankind, for the most part, have been driven 
   off into factionalism. This factionalism serves no one any benefit. 
   And yet, many sensitive people fall victim to it. You have your 
   little groups that remain little groups. You have certain sensitive 
   people that must collect a small grouping around them to assuage 
   their doubts and their fears. Because there are those there that are 
   listening to them.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>You have other sensitive people that must tell who they 
   know, what they know; so that they will be considered all right. You 
   have sensitive people that must tell others how sensitive they are 
   and how insensitive others are. And what does this accomplish? An 
   extinguishing of the light. 'Tis a victory for the dark forces. 
   They're getting the very people who are here to lead, to serve as an 
   example, to do their work [the dark forces'] for them.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This <B>disunity</B> must be overcome. There is no need 
   to compete; there is no need to make one an exclusive item, and 
   that's what's occurred. Your traditional organizations have fallen 
   victim to this. ............, the list is endless. And they have all 
   fallen victim to their<B> fears</B> and their need to say that they 
   are right. And what makes them right makes everybody else wrong. That 
   is not ones purpose. Right and wrong is relative on the physical 
   plane. You have two clearly defined dichotomies. <B>Growth - Evolution</B> 
   and <B>Regression - Involution</B>.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Always questioning, keeping an open mind, keeping a 
   constant flow of information, is growth. Regressing into dogma; 
   telling people that yours is the only way, is regression. It's 
   limiting. This is a pitfall of the physical plane that must be overcome......</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>....... Numerous past-lives have contributed to the 
   fears, the doubts, the anxieties, the worries, the limited beliefs 
   and these must be looked at, and resolved, in each of you..... As my 
   distinguished colleague Sir Arthur has stated in the past, there are 
   those that will not make it. There are those that will waste this 
   lifetime and that is a tragedy, not only for the individual entity 
   but for those that they came here to assist.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>So consider these words. Consider those three elements, 
   perhaps discuss them amongst yourselves. Because a viable system 
   needs to be created to help the many to overcome the divisions, the 
   factionalism, the <B>disunity</B>; and work as one for the <B>light 
   of wisdom</B>.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Ask yourself if you are doing what you need to do to 
   remove these elements from within yourselves. And if you're not 
   making <B>conscious effort</B>, you're <B>not removing</B> these 
   elements. We would advise you to do so.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And with that I shall leave you. And I bid you a good evening.</FONT>
