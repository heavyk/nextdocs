   <FONT SIZE=4>An Inspiration Message Presented by D.K. at a 
   Spiritualist Meeting</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>October 4, 1985</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It is I D.K. I bring you a message this evening of joy 
   and hope; of depression and despair. For you see one is within the 
   other and the other is within the one. It is important to realize 
   that the mean of the path is the hardest to maintain but by far the 
   easiest on you the traveler.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>There are some of you here this evening that have fear; 
   fear of the spirit; fear of yourself. Fear is the most defeating of 
   all reactions.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Why should you fear the spirit when you are a part of 
   it? Although you currently inhabit a physical body, one day that will 
   not be so and your spiritual self will go to the spiritual planes at 
   the level that your work and growth on the physical level designates. 
   And yet people are so fearful of that which they are a part.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Fear serves no useful purpose but to create inner 
   turmoil; to cause the attack of self. It has been said that the 
   coward dies a thousand deaths, but the brave one. These are wise 
   words for they mean that living in fear, fear of yourself, fear of 
   your abilities, will serve no useful purpose. For you are you; you 
   are yourself.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We take this opportunity to speak this evening to 
   perhaps awaken you to the talents, the potential, that lies within 
   each of you. For you see each here is a light waiting to shine; a 
   diamond in the rough requiring the effort to turn the intensity up; 
   to polish, to hone, to develop the talents and capabilities necessary 
   to reach spiritual maturity and to help those others of your fellows 
   that are lost and wandering through the many pitfalls and 
   distractions along both sides of the path; the extremes that I 
   mentioned earlier.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>You must ask yourself what there is to fear. You must 
   ask yourself if you truly accept yourself. This is the hardest thing 
   to face; to truly face [SELF]...</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We have been working to help, to bring to mankind, 
   knowledge and insights to allow a greater development of spiritual 
   faculties and perceptions. These are needed for the times ahead. For 
   many people the future will be a dark one but it does not have to be 
   so. The light of spiritual truth must shine through, but it requires 
   those among you to be willing to make the effort and overcome self 
   imposed limitations so that you will be able to shine forth in a 
   spiritual manner.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Examine your fears. Are they valid ones? Do you fear a 
   ghost, as you would put it? If so you fear yourself. Do you fear 
   someone or something attacking you? If so you fear yourself ?</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The world of spirit is no more of a threat to you than 
   the physical environment in which you live. In actuality it is less a 
   threat for many spiritual beings are currently working to assist you 
   in the development of your talents. That is why we are taking this 
   opportunity to speak this evening knowing that it is a new experience 
   for some and perhaps a threatening one.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>However, each individual must assimilate the material 
   and the experience within themselves. As with any communication one 
   must look at what the words say, what the words mean, whether this be 
   from a fellow human or from a non-physical source. This is the true 
   value with any communication no matter what the source.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We hope this evening that you have benefited in some way 
   by our making the effort to speak to you. We hope that you will 
   continue to work to develop the talents, to develop the potentials 
   that each of you possess. Open yourselves up. Continue to seek your 
   spiritual selves for that is the light that shines through all 
   darkness; that shines through all the dismal depths of despair. For 
   there is hope, there is joy and it is found within the spiritual 
   selves that each possess. This is something that is your heritage, 
   that is your birthright. But as with anything, one must work to 
   accept the responsibility of the birthright; to develop the talents, 
   the capabilities that are there.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We would like each of you to go in peace this evening. 
   We bless you and thank you for attending. We hope that over time we 
   will come to speak to you on more occasions and that more people will 
   be ready to hear our words. With that I shall bid you a good evening 
   and again give you our blessings.</FONT>
