  <P>
   Lodge here. Tonight we would like to continue our discussion of 
   personal reality. As was said previously, personal reality is a 
   confused issue on the physical plane. From our perspective, 'tis 
   vastly different.
  </P>
  <P>
   As has been mentioned, a primary goal of existence is to return to 
   the Universal SOURCE of energy. In order to do this, one must 
   overcome the first three planes: the PHYSICAL plane, the ASTRAL plane 
   and the MENTAL plane. These three lower levels are what comprises 
   matter and form. And a man's normal condition is very limited; he is 
   limited by his ordinary senses; his ordinary perceptions. These 
   limitations can be overcome to a great extent by consciously 
   establishing contact with the higher levels of existence.
  </P>
  <P>
   A way to view man in the physical is to liken the physical vehicle as 
   a nucleus, and each subsequent plane as a layer expanding out into 
   infinity. If you were to have an onion with a rock in the center and 
   you peeled away the layers, when you got to the rock, you would have 
   your physical reality and the physical vehicle of the individual. And 
   so this rock is surrounded by many layers of reality. The further 
   away from the center of the rock that you get, the more abstract 
   until the ultimate is pure energy.
  </P>
  <P>
   The human vehicle and human consciousness are the highest vibrational 
   frequency on the physical plane. The rest of the plane is comprised 
   of lower vibrational levels and lower consciousness levels. And yet, 
   under ordinary circumstances, the physical vehicle is still like a 
   rock compared to the higher levels of existence.
  </P>
  <P>
   Thus, in the normal level of development, this rock with its weighted 
   consciousness goes through its normal birth and death cycle, but the 
   consciousness is still heavy and after the death transition it floats 
   up a bit, but soon again settles to the bottom to complete another 
   birth/death cycle.
  </P>
  <P>
   Each bit of weight that the consciousness can shed while on the 
   bottom, allows it to float a bit higher with each subsequent death 
   transition. Until finally the ensuing spirit does not settle back to 
   the bottom and the path of physical incarnations is broken. And this 
   is done by raising the level of consciousness and increasing the 
   magnitude of the energies that the entity handles while on the 
   physical plane; by raising the frequency on the physical plane.
  </P>
  <P>
   You are moving more towards the eventual sinking back to the bottom, 
   to be born again into the physical vehicle. If you think of, it the 
   term light has at least two different conceptions. It is a quality 
   that of being not heavy and it is a radiation that we can see with. 
   Thus, the movement towards the light. Think about it.
  </P>
  <P>
   In considering reality the individual has to know SELF and expand the 
   awareness of SELF.
  </P>
  <P>
   Would there be any questions? [There were no questions].
  </P>
  <P>
   The transmission conditions are a bit difficult this evening and it 
   is difficult to transmit the information that we desire. Thus we will 
   terminate the transmission until the conditions are more favorable. 
   The issue of reality is an important one. Tis also a confusing one. 
   We will deal with it in more detail in the future and we will present 
   it in a form that is understandable to your present consciousnesses. 
   This has been the shortcomings of literature on the topic over the 
   last 50 years and we hope to remedy this. And with that I bid you a 
   good evening.
