   When I was practicing automatic writing, I had the distinct 
   impression of someone standing behind me. Of course, I would turn 
   around to see nothing. However, over time, the impression got 
   stronger. It also became obvious that this was NOT my subconscious writing.
  </P>
  <P>
   There were a number of clues to suggest this. As I mentioned, 
   initially, there were symbols, drawn the same way and strung together 
   like sentences. Then symbols and words. Finally, names began to 
   appear. Yes, names. Not ones I recognized: Oldegon, Alad and DK for example.
  </P>
  <P>
   Each name would have a different writing style and the 
   &quot;feel&quot; would be different. There were a few other names 
   that showed up rarely but those were the main ones.
  </P>
  <P>
   After it became fairly clear that these beings were indeed real and 
   outside myself, I began to have the irrational concern that I was 
   going to see a ghost. In retrospect, I feel it was a symbolic concern 
   in that I was going to &quot;see&quot; the things that had been 
   hidden from me all my life.
  </P>
  <P>
   None the less, the automatic writing was fascinating to me. The 
   writers were telling me things in answer to my questions. They 
   commented about Atlantis, energy and extra-terrestrials. Yes, they 
   identified themselves as extra-terrestrials. Well, I just went with 
   it taking it with the proverbial grain of salt. They would even 
   occasionally write down when &quot;appointments&quot; with 
   extra-terrestrials would take place. Of course, the day would come 
   and go with no conscious recall. This was 1977 after all and I didn't 
   know about Missing Time. I just assumed that distortion was getting 
   into the writing. It wasn't but that's another story.
  </P>
  <P>
   At this point, I need to mention a little background information 
   about myself. I have always had a &quot;problem&quot; with sleeping. 
   Actually, it's been more of a bother to others than me because I 
   don't remember it most of the time but I talk in my sleep and I Sleep 
   WALK. I've done this at least since the age of 5. It was a real 
   source of concern to my parents because I would apparently leave the 
   house! I just learned to accept the fact that when I go to sleep and 
   wake up the next day, I can't really be sure I didn't go somewhere in 
   the meantime. Seems like most people are disturbed when this happens 
   to them but it has never bothered me except to be concerned that I 
   might bother someone else with it.
  </P>
  <P>
   Anyway, as part of this phenomena, since childhood, I have awakened 
   and seen things. I mean physically see strange things. As I watch, 
   they tend to fade away but I am awake. However, I never saw anything 
   that disturbed me until 1977. I awoke one night and floating in the 
   air was a full size form. It was not clearly defined; it was misty 
   gray. I was looking straight at it when I opened my eyes. The form 
   was about four feet off the ground and five feet from the end of the 
   bed. It was looking down on me.
  </P>
  <P>
   I can honestly say that this scared the pitootee out of me. I 
   literally gasped and my heart started pounding as I watched this 
   form. I could tell, even in my agitated, state that it was aware of 
   the effect it was having on me. It seemed to send me some sort of 
   message such as don't worry and then faded away as I watched.
  </P>
  <P>
   When it was gone, I jumped up and headed for the light. I slept with 
   the light on the rest of the night. Sort of silly for a 25 year old. 
   But, that encounter was necessary to get me over the fear of what was 
   to develop next.
