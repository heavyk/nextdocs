   <FONT SIZE=4>AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL VIEW OF CREATION - PART ONE</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The following information was channeled on May 15, 1984. 
   It is presented intact from the transcript except with minor 
   deletions for readability. Such deletions will be designated with a 
   string of period. Any changed wording will be enclosed by [ ].</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The presenter of this information is the Entity Kathumi, 
   a name well known in Theosophical circles.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Good evening my children and beloved colleagues</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>I would like to introduce myself. ..... Among my many 
   names, the one that I have been most recently referred to is Kathumi.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Tonight, if at all possible, I would like to begin the 
   revelations concerning the origins of your Universe.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The age of this Universe is much older than your 
   scientists can comprehend and this is because they do not understand 
   the creation process. And this I shall attempt to explain to a degree 
   this evening.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Each Universe is a living entity in and unto itself. 
   And, just like the poor analogy of the human form, it is born; grows; 
   matures and then dies. This death is but a transition; a transition 
   and a rebirth into a new form with added features and added 
   challenges. And thus, the Universe that you now inhabit is the 
   rebirth of the prior Universe. This prior Universe that existed and 
   grew and matured and then passed through the transition.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And so, just as now, we of the hierarchy of this planet, 
   joined with the hierarchies of other planets and the cosmic council, 
   are working for the maturation of this Universe. The prior Universe 
   also had such structures. And, as the maturation point was 
   approached, the councils of the prior Universe set about the task of 
   delivering the next Universe; the rebirth of the Universe.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And the elders of these councils joined together and 
   formed the structure that was to transcend the barrier and serve as 
   the organizing principal for the new Universe. And so these advanced 
   entities set about to create their sons and daughters that would 
   actually serve as the building blocks of the new Universe. And these 
   sons and daughters were created and the training process began and 
   lasted, up until it was time for the transition.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When you think of the transition, a small scale of that 
   transition would be what you refer to as a super nova. You can 
   imagine a super nova multiplied by a factor of ten to the trillion; 
   you will have the magnitude of the transition energy of the prior 
   Universe. And all the consciousness of that prior Universe were 
   expanded and went on their evolutionary paths to other levels of 
   reality, except for the small group that was to serve as the guiding 
   force behind the creation and development of the new entity; the new Universe.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And so these elders and their creations, their children 
   if you will, passed through the barrier into the void and began the 
   building process.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The first order of business was the establishing of the 
   various councils, the various directing bodies, to serve in the 
   creation. However, in passing the barrier, several of the entities 
   were damaged which has led to problems of which we will talk about in 
   the near future.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The development of these entities has been characterized 
   in recent civilizations as the &quot;Gods&quot;. They were developed 
   to the point where they were capable of creating consciousness, not 
   creating a biological form, but actually creating the spirit that 
   inhabits it. And so one of the first tasks of the council was to 
   begin creating consciousnesses, spirits if you will, that were 
   suitable for the new Universe and this they proceeded to do.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The purpose of this creation was not to have company. It 
   was not to have adoring, humble worshipers, but it was to create the 
   consciousness form necessary for the growth and maturation of the 
   current Universe. And so the energies from the Universal <B>SOURCE</B>,
    the source of all life, was drawn by the councils and the creation 
   process started.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The elders of the prior Universe serve as advisors, as 
   the wise directors, which is not a good term for it because they do 
   not direct as such. They were there to be called upon by their 
   children, whose task it was to be the creators of the consciousness 
   and the matter of this Universe. And so perhaps you are beginning to 
   see why the myth of God and his Son has come to pass. That was a 
   distortion that crept into civilization rather recently in the 
   history of humanity.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>For you see the task of creation is very large and it 
   requires the primary elements of all life, the positive; the negative 
   and the neutral. It requires a trinity and this is the trinity of 
   creation. And this is what the elders of the prior Universe created 
   to serve specifically as the creators for the consciousnesses of the 
   new Universe. And so the various trinities or triads, as we call 
   them, set about the task of creating consciousnesses. And this went 
   on for a long period of time as you would measure it here on earth. 
   However you must realize that the time passage on earth is a gross 
   distortion of time passage in this Universe. There is a difference 
   between spiritual time and biological time. Biological time has been 
   steadily reduced due to the corruption of the spirit on this 
   particular planet. And we shall talk about that when we talk about 
   the creation of this planet in particular.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>But referring back to the creation of spirits or souls, 
   this was indeed done as the first order of business by the elders and 
   their creations, their sons and daughters of the primary triads. At 
   this point it is opportune to mention that the planet earth was long 
   delayed in creation. In that I mean that it is very recently created. 
   Other parts of the Universe were built initially and all this 
   operated at a very high vibrational level.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And so the initial form that the sons and daughters 
   under the guidance of the elders created was a form similar to the 
   one that they'd used in the prior Universe. The purpose of this was 
   to have a base of operation from which to branch out and start the 
   construction process. And so as these spirits were created, the new 
   consciousnesses that would inhabit this Universe, they were stored. 
   You could think of them as little spheres of energy that would 
   eventually evolve into the consciousnesses that you know today. And 
   they were stored for use at a later time.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And so at this point we shall terminate our transmission 
   for this evening. We are having to organize this information and put 
   it into a form that the consciousness can comprehend. And so we have 
   worked and put it in segments and we shall transmit a segment at a time.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And so the important points to remember from the first 
   segment are [ORIGINALLY IS] that a prior Universe existed. The elders 
   of the councils of that Universe created their sons and daughters to 
   serve as the creators of the next Universe. And they all transcended 
   the barrier into the void to serve as the nucleus for the creation of 
   the new Universe. And the first tasks that they set about was 
   creating a form that they were familiar with and the creating of the 
   consciousness vehicles that would serve as the inhabitants of the new Universe.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As best as possible we shall attempt to follow a 
   chronological pattern of development although these events that I am 
   relating do not follow linear time. But we are working to put it into 
   a form that is understandable and you must forgive us if it has an 
   air of simplicity.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>My blessings upon each and every one of you. Continue 
   your work, continue your path of progress to evolve to become the 
   entities that each of you are. So be it.</FONT>
