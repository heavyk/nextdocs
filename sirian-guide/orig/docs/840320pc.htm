  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Lodge here. Tonight we shall discourse a bit on the 
   nature of reality. The nature of personal reality is an issue that is 
   easily confused on the physical plane.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>An important point to remember is that you do create 
   your own reality. [However], the variable that is left out all too 
   often is that numerous individual realities overlap to various 
   degrees. Thus, components of other people's realities affect your 
   own. It is a factor that is important in structuring outcomes as you 
   would have them.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>You cannot ignore the reality of others because it does 
   affect you. Each individual entity emits energy; these energy 
   patterns interact.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In the past in other cultures, certain individuals 
   decided they would have a greater control of their realities by 
   isolating themselves from their brethren. In this sense they were 
   controlling the physical influences of others. However, you must 
   remember that the physical plane is the bottom level of reality and 
   it is affected by the planes above it. Obviously the astral and the 
   mental levels, which are the two closest, have the strongest impact. 
   And there are beings that dwell at these levels that also intersect 
   with our personal realities. And they too become variables that must 
   be considered in the structuring of your own personal reality.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Denying their existence, ignoring them will not make 
   them go away and will not dampen their influence because the energies 
   are there and they affect you. Just like, for example, we could deny 
   that the moon exists and yet the gravitational pull, the magnetic 
   influences, would still be a factor. We could go and live in a cave 
   somewhere and never see it and yet the moon, the physical body, would 
   influence our reality.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The thoughts of others impact upon us. They are also 
   energy; they are incorporated in our individual reality. And it's the 
   joining and configuration of thoughts that create the overall reality 
   and serves as the cement that holds together this plane. It's said 
   that you can't get vast number of people to work together, and yet 
   that is the one factor that all of humanity has; they all agree that 
   reality, physical reality, exists. And thus it is. The trick is to 
   get them thinking in other directions because the reality that is 
   usually created is one that is more motivated by the regressive 
   portions of the mind.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And so in looking at the total picture of reality, you 
   have three points of definition. You have your <B>neutral</B> point. 
   You have your <B>positive</B> point. You have your <B>negative</B> 
   point. These portions are replicated in nature. You have your 
   darkness and you have your light; you have your male and you have 
   your female. And you have your ground, your firmament, if you will. 
   And so due to the nature of polarities and your balances in the 
   system, the concept of good and evil does apply [but] only in the 
   sense of evolution versus involution. And trying to ignore one or the 
   other does not work. One is kidding themselves here on the physical 
   plane when that is attempted. We cannot wish away the negative 
   forces. Just as we have no desire to wish away the positive ones. We 
   cannot wish away the darkness to have perpetual light. Each phase has 
   its necessary role in physical reality. And as long as mind is within 
   a body, the forces will apply. We do not have to augment the negative 
   side. But denying its reality will not make it go away.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We cannot stand in front of a moving vehicle and expect 
   it to pass through us or we through it unscathed because that vehicle 
   is part of someone else's reality. And that energy form intersects 
   our energy form with dire consequences.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>'Tis true that reality is an illusion but how can you 
   get all portions of your mind to totally believe it for any great 
   length of time. Takes a great deal of will power and effort to 
   overcome it. And just saying that you believe does not necessarily 
   make it so. To truly believe it is to transcend physical reality but 
   it takes more than simply saying that you believe it for it to be so. 
   It takes more than saying that the negative forces do not exist 
   because they intersect your reality nonetheless.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Now, it is important to rebuild your belief structures. 
   And that is what many of you have been working on; the rebuilding of 
   the belief structures. And yet I cannot help but emphasize that 
   others beliefs affect you and can impede your progress. And this 
   applies not only to people around you but to non-physicals as well. 
   And on the lower levels there are numerous entities that have 
   regressive beliefs and they surround people and pump them into their 
   system. And so you can be sabotaged not only by your own system but 
   that from other sources as well. And it is important to keep this in mind.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>No one can go onto a hill top and isolate themselves, 
   and transcend the physical plane. Because the physical plane and the 
   astral plane and the mental plane is in truth what must be 
   transcended. And physically isolating yourself only takes care of one 
   segment. The other segments intersect you and are always with you. 
   Denial does not change that reality.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>So in summary for this evening. There are three 
   conditions to reality. The <B>positive</B> and the <B>negative</B> 
   and the <B>neutral</B>. You do create your own reality, but that 
   reality is intersected not only from the physical plane but the 
   nonphysical levels; primarily the astral and the mental levels. It is 
   these variables that affect your reality. You must take all of these 
   factors into consideration before you can successfully control the outcome.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>You must have harmony on all the lower planes and 
   generate a field of harmony around yourself to successfully say you 
   are in control of your reality. This is why, as an example, that the 
   most skeptical, or I should say close-minded individuals never have 
   transcendental experiences of their own and cause people who are 
   capable of such experiences to have poor results. They send the 
   energy that disrupts or interferes with the intended outcome. And as 
   your sensitivities grow, you will become more aware of these 
   individuals, and occasionally you will find one of your own enveloped 
   in a cloud of this negative energy as representative of negative 
   entities from the astral and to a degree the mental level. And in 
   many instances they will not be aware of it. And it is your 
   responsibility to point it out to them so they can take the necessary 
   measures to eliminate the interference and the hindrance. Otherwise 
   such disruption can ride into a closed sphere such as this and cause 
   unnecessary disruption.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It is important to expand your view of reality to 
   include that of others and that is an important key to success in 
   transcending the physical plane. You cannot look upon yourself as an 
   ego sphere. You must take a allocentric view point. That includes 
   other spheres of reality or other individuals realities and their 
   dynamic affect upon your own. This from a physical as well as a non 
   physical basis.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Contemplate this issue. Formulate any questions that you 
   may have. And if you have such questions and you would like them 
   answered, record them in some manner and make your intent known. 
   Discuss them amongst yourselves and if the issue is not resolved to 
   your satisfaction, you can put in a request and I or one of my 
   colleagues will come and answer them from our perspective.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And with that I bid you a good evening.</FONT>
