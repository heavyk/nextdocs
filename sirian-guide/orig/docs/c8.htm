   During this time a friend of mine and I had been working to develop 
   conscious astral projection. In addition, when we got the chance, we 
   were working with the Ouija board. For me, the Ouija board was 
   producing the same effect as the automatic writing; the sentences 
   would form in my mind before the pointer spelled them out. When we 
   used the board, we always had success as the pointer would come alive.
  </P>
  <P>
   By now, my friend and I agreed that we were dealing with something 
   really amazing. We were working on several areas with all the 
   enthusiasm of youth: spirit communication, astral projection and 
   reincarnation. Both of us had limited results with conscious astral 
   projection, one of which I mentioned previously.
  </P>
  <P>
   We also discovered that we were getting reincarnation or past life 
   information from subconscious communication that was essentially, but 
   independently, identical. At this time, my friend lived in another 
   state and we didn't get to see each other often. But we would share 
   notes on the phone as computers and e-mail were unheard of at the 
   time for personal use.
  </P>
  <P>
   We read what we could find on astral projection trying to arrive at a 
   more reliable method. In addition to Robert Monroe's Journeys Out of 
   the Body, there were a few older books by Sylvan Muldoon and Hereward 
   Carrington. We discovered that it was not simple to do but we were 
   getting results. We even had the foolish notion that we could write 
   down these experiences and it would be useful to people. Ah, the 
   naivet&eacute; of youth.
  </P>
  <P>
   Anyway, I noticed that working the Ouija board caused the same 
   phenomena with me as the automatic writing: fatigue after a while and 
   a pain in the middle back between the shoulders. There was something 
   else however. It seemed that less powerful spirits could communicate 
   easier via the Ouija board than with automatic writing.
  </P>
  <P>
   My friend and I looked forward to our weekly telephone conversation 
   to share our experiences because so much was happening. When 
   something really wild happened, we would let the other know via telephone.
  </P>
  <P>
   I had the chance to go visit my friend for a few days in his home 
   state and had a very powerful experience. Reflecting back on it, I 
   can see that it was another developmental step to mediumship.
  </P>
  <P>
   My friend and I, since we so rarely saw each other, had worked the 
   Ouija board until I was pooped. We had made contact with two entities 
   that identified themselves as being associated with us and were there 
   to help us with our spiritual development. Mine identified herself as 
   Kerry. She really couldn't write through automatic writing but she 
   could communicate with the Ouija board.
  </P>
  <P>
   We were disappointed we could only communicate for an hour or so that 
   evening. Thus, we spent the rest of the evening chatting until very 
   late. For some reason, I was very tired and accidentally drifted off 
   to &quot;sleep&quot; while my friend and I were suppose to be chatting.
  </P>
  <P>
   However, what happened was this. It was like I felt myself pulled 
   into the center of my head in a concentrated form. When this 
   happened, I saw a scene that looked like stars in the night sky. Then 
   I was partially detached from my body looking at my friend who was in 
   mid-sentence. Without losing consciousness, I snapped back and told 
   him what happened. The experience was short but just a warm-up for 
   what was to happen after I went to sleep that night.
  </P>
  <P>
   TO BE CONTINUED. I MATERIALIZE AND SCARE MY COUSIN
