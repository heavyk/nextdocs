   <FONT SIZE=4>THE NATURE OF LOVE</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>LOVE. The most used concept on your planet today has no 
   definition. The word for it is so misunderstood and over used that it 
   has no meaning. That which relates one creature to another with the 
   well being of the other in mind, has been prostituted into another 
   word for selfishness.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The word is LOVE but the concept man has yet to grasp!</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Earthlings preach love, teach love, talk love, fantasize 
   love, and write about love. They lie for it, cheat for it, buy it and 
   kill for it. AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS!</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>What does a religious person mean when he instructs you 
   to love God. Does he not intend to evoke FEAR within you?</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>What does it mean when someone &quot;loves his 
   country?&quot; Is it not merely to obligate him to the killing of his 
   own kind whose only crime is living outside a man-made political boundary?</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When someone says &quot;I love you!&quot;; how often do 
   you immediately wonder what they want? Especially children who 
   haven't developed greater subtly.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>What does it mean when a man tells a woman that he loves 
   her?... &quot;You're a sexy bitch and I'd sure like to get it on with 
   you&quot; ...or what does it mean when a woman answers back... &quot;I
    love you too.&quot; They proceed to have sex and she is thinking, 
   &quot;I gotcha now, meal ticket!&quot;</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In your culture when you grow up, it is expected of you 
   to fall in love and marry. What does this really mean?</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I love you&quot; usually means: I desire your body 
   or I want to own you; I want you to be with me all the time and do 
   everything I want you to, when I want you to do it; I want you to 
   make me a living; I want you to take away all my problems and make me 
   happy; I want you to be an instant sex machine, and on and on. This 
   is what most of humanity means when they use the word LOVE.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>How utterly nauseating to a true SECOND RAY as I am!</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Please allow yourselves to consider what you mean when 
   you use this all important word. When you are lonely (and everyone is 
   at sometime) and you wish for someone to love you; what do you really want?</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When you are seized by this inner longing, and you began 
   to search for that someone who can relieve this compelling, gnawing, 
   inner itch, who are you searching for?</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The long sleepless nights - when you cry out in anguish 
   over the never ending desire for that special someone who is meant 
   just for you and can satisfy you completely, give you peace and 
   happiness - you have in common with all evolving entities! That 
   search becomes the main driving force in life.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>People find a mate thinking this will solve the longing; 
   then they find that the mate is human also, with faults and has their 
   own driving force. The fascination fades; the search is on again. 
   Some people turn to lover after lover; some give up on people and 
   turn to careers or intellectual pursuits resigning themselves to that 
   inner loneliness. They feel that ceasing to hope for it is less painful.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Too bad! All the above is merely symptoms that are 
   normal for evolving humans, but what is unfortunate is that they have 
   no one to teach them what these symptoms indicate nor a methodology 
   by which to enlighten themselves.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Whose love can satisfy you?</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Who is it that can stop that aching aloneness, so that 
   it never returns again?</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Who is it that can give you peace and contentment that 
   can't be shaken by the principalities of darkness?</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Whom do you really love and seek?</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The answer is the same as He that you SHOULD love and seek:</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>YOURSELF</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>I Will now give you a definition of Love--</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>I AM YOU</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When I can be YOU, experiencing all of YOU, taking my 
   share of all of your heartaches, pains and sorrows; and when I KNOW 
   that all I have is also yours, that I am YOU and YOU are ME -- then 
   you KNOW and ARE - LOVE. One cannot know LOVE without BECOMING love. 
   LOVE is a sacred, all encompassing, BEAUTIFUL, JOYFUL (yes, I said 
   JOYFUL!!) experience of the Second Aspect of Divinity. Notice that 
   word DIVINITY. To know love is to know the Second Aspect which can be 
   referred to as GOD! To experience love is to experience GOD! Is that 
   not something to rejoice over?</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Consider these things.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>I want to emphasize that I am not against any of the 
   male-female relationships found in your society; only the 
   misrepresentation of LOVE that they usually involve. You'll notice 
   that I'm big on Love. It fills me with its GOODNESS and I like to 
   spread joy to all. I also like to see the aspect of divinity that I 
   personify understood and appreciated for all its wondrousness!!!</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Unfortunately, the misunderstanding leaves many couples 
   very disillusioned by expecting something from outside themselves 
   that is only obtainable from within.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Another point concerning relationships, in the relating 
   of the sexes there is a remnant from the animal kingdom and that is 
   the game of courtship. People should be made aware that it is a game. 
   Watch birds, some of them have intricately beautiful courting games. 
   These are to be enjoyed. There is nothing that can uplift a person 
   more than a cloud nine romance. But please realize what it is. It's 
   the patterns that energy likes to make in order to draw to it the 
   pattern it wants to experience.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Now that you know that romance is no more than excited 
   electrons seeking a higher shell of energy, don't let it break your 
   heart when the protons leave your electrons and they are no longer 
   excited. Just enjoy it while it lasts. There is always a big supply 
   of electrons seeking a quantum leap!</FONT>
