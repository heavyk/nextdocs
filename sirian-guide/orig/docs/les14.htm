   <FONT SIZE=4>MENTAL PLANE</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>We had gotten somewhat into the MENTAL plane in our 
   discussion of cosmology... We will go over the high points concerning 
   it, give you a new meditation, and next week proceed to the BUDDHIC plane.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As you remember, the MENTAL plane houses three different 
   vehicles for Mun. The CONCRETE MIND; that which the consciousness 
   uses in the thinking process. The SOLAR ANGEL or SOUL; that which 
   steps down the energy of the MONAD so that it can be used by Mun in 
   the earlier stages of evolution. The ABSTRACT MIND; that which the 
   MONAD uses as Mun uses the CONCRETE MIND.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When you enter the realm of the ABSTRACT MIND, language 
   ceases to be used. Communication is from mind to mind and is 
   transmitted in symbols. One symbol will represent a whole concept or 
   a school of philosophy. These symbols usually have no meaning to the 
   consciousness unless it is trained in their use.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In the ABSTRACT MIND level, the use of symbols along 
   with minds speaking directly to minds allows much greater accuracy in 
   conveying meanings and conceptions. It also allows incredibly fast 
   assimilation of information. A whole school of thought can be 
   conveyed with the sight of one symbol. These symbols are not dead 
   abstractions; they contain within them all the nuances of the thing 
   within itself. Not just details but the essence can be brought before 
   you to examine as one object.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Being able to see the essence of things negates the 
   possibility of Mun lying to Mun on that level. Or if it was 
   attempted, it would be extremely evident to all those around. For 
   what is, is that which is, there to be seen by all on that level.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>MEDITATION</FONT>
  </P>
  <UL>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>1. Go through your alignment process and polarize your 
   consciousness in the ABSTRACT MIND. Carefully build and secure the 
   link from the CONCRETE MIND to the ABSTRACT MIND.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>2. Briefly consider the material about how the ABSTRACT 
   MIND works, then look out from it into the plane of the ABSTRACT MIND 
   and see what you perceive.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>3. Bring consciousness back to the SOUL level, (which is 
   referred to as the &quot;midpoint&quot; between the MONAD and 
   physical) and link up with your deity type. What comes from this link 
   up could differ from day to day.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>4. Refocus your consciousness into the physical in the 
   usual manner.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>5. Sound the AUM sending out into the world your ray 
   types' energy applied in love. (The ray type corresponds to the deity 
   type for these deities were personifications of pure rays.</FONT>
