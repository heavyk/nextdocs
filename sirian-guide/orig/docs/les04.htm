   <FONT SIZE=4>LESSON FOUR</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In this lesson, we will look at the physical plane and 
   its correspondencies: the SEVENTH RAY, the element earth, and the 
   physical and etheric vehicles of MUN.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=3>THE PHYSICAL PLANE</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The physical plane is the bottom or 7th on your chart. 
   Its color is violet because of the SEVENTH RAY energy with which it vibrates.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It is composed of seven subplanes. The numbering begins 
   at the top with one.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=3>SUBPLANES</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>1. VIBRATION (subatomic): Before matter is synthesized 
   into waves and particulates.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>2. THE WORD: The force or charge that will hold together 
   the forms that matter will subsequently take. The physical known 
   results of this force is synergy.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This force allows the whole to be greater than the sum 
   of its parts.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>3. LIGHT (all phenomena that can be classified as waves 
   and/or particles.): Example is electromagnetic radiation.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>4A. SOUND: Wave/particles are synthesized into atomic 
   particles. This occurs on the top half of this subplane.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>4B. COLOR: Diffraction into elements. Final step from 
   etheric into gross matter. This occurs of the bottom half of this 
   subplane. The whole plane is geometrically represented by a triangle 
   or a tetrahedron.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>5. GASEOUS: State of matter that remains as a gas. It is 
   hard to confine into form, has great movement and expands 
   indefinitely. Air is the element of the mind within man and relates 
   to the fifth plane. Geometrically represented by a circle or a sphere.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>6. LIQUID: The state of matter that remains in liquid 
   form. It has contracted from the gaseous state, yet still has no 
   fixed form. It readily takes whatever form that is imposed upon it. 
   Water represents emotions and the astral plane. Geometrically 
   represented by a crescent, an upside down triangle or a figure 
   resulting from the rotation of the crescent about an axis 
   perpendicular to the lowest point of its outside arc. Try that; you 
   will find the design of value.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>7. SOLID: The fixed state of matter where form is 
   rigidly imposed upon it. The point where substance has imposed upon 
   it the greatest amount of form, rigidity and inertia. The beginning 
   of the return of substance on the evolutionary arc. Geometrically 
   represented by a square or a cube.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The Physical plane is where involution turns into 
   evolution; where consciousness begins to be fanned into 
   SELF-consciousness and the return to SOURCE is begun.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The SEVENTH RAY is most vital on the physical plane for 
   it forces the substance into forms best suited to the purpose of the 
   indwelling life. The SEVENTH RAY is lord of order by forms. The 
   SEVENTH RAY works closely with the FIRST RAY. When the form no longer 
   meets the need of the indwelling life, the SEVENTH RAY calls the 
   FIRST RAY who then shatters the form, freeing the life so that it can 
   progress and the substance can be reused by the SEVENTH RAY.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The SEVENTH RAY and the FIRST RAY are ALPHA and OMEGA. 
   They form the circle where the serpent of power bites its tail.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The physical permanent atom is on the first subplane. 
   [There is a permanent atom on each plane. The permanent atom is the 
   storage place for everything that has happened to an entity. From the 
   information stored in the permanent atoms on each plane, the vehicles 
   for the next incarnation are built.] The top four subplanes are 
   considered the etheric.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The etheric centers of MUN are located within the fourth 
   subplane although they have some of the higher substances within them 
   especially if the person is on the path.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=3>THE ELEMENT EARTH = INERTIA</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Earth, the element, represents INERTIA. INERTIA is the 
   state of substance that offers the greatest resistance to change. 
   Involution still retains a strong pull.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Earth is related to the mineral kingdom.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The element earth is the North cardinal point fixed by the</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>position of the pole star. It is often represented by 
   the horn of plenty in earth tones with a splash of violet shades. Its 
   guardian or arch angel is Ariel, who is also pictured as a beautiful 
   purple deva.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In the Kabala, the element Earth is the sepher MALKUT 
   and in the Tarot it is represented by the suit Disks, sometimes 
   called coins or diamonds. In astrology, earth is represented by 
   Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Once again let us emphasize. This information is 
   different from what your culture would train you in. It requires a 
   mode of thinking that has deliberately been left out of your 
   educational systems for thousands of years. (If MUN does not know 
   what he is, he is much easier to dominate.)</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This method of thought trains your creativity and 
   intuition. These symbols and various analogies call your Soul and 
   Spiritual Triad into conscious functioning.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Don't try to memorize a great deal of this as if it were 
   for a history test. Just read it over often. Notice the analogies and 
   soon you will begin to relate them to all things around you.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=3>KNOW THYSELF !</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>A student of return should endeavor to uncover and 
   explore ALL facets of himself. Each person (at present) is the sum 
   total of his past. The old adage of what one doesn't know doesn't 
   hurt him is one of the greatest negations of MUNkind. If you believed 
   in the devil, that phrase would be his greatest slogan.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Always, it is what you do not know about yourself that 
   can sneak up and cause you to react in a manner that is contrary to 
   the results you wish to obtain.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>How do you learn yourself? To begin with, it helps to 
   establish how much you know about yourselves and how much thought is 
   given to your every action. It will usually surprise you just how 
   little this is.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>At the close of the day, or several times a day if you 
   like, reflect on why you did what you did and said what you said in 
   every situation you found yourself in......</FONT>
