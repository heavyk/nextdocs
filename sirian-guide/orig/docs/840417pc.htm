  </P>
  <P>
   Doyle here. Tonight I shall take up the conversation where my learned 
   colleague left off.
  </P>
  <P>
   In referring back to the analogy of the onion with the rock in the 
   center; you might say that Lodge is more concerned with the outer 
   layers of the onion and I am more concerned with the center, or the 
   rock, which represents human consciousness and its automaton, the 
   physical vehicle.
  </P>
  <P>
   The rock that is human consciousness has much unnecessary weight 
   attached to it. This unnecessary weight has accumulated due to the 
   nature of the physical plane. It has been referred to down through 
   the ages as Karma.
  </P>
  <P>
   Karmic patterns are not a necessary function of the physical plane. 
   In other words you do not have to play out Karmic patterns. You are 
   in control when you can neutralize the reactionary patterns of 
   thought which is referred to as Karma. The reactions of Karma 
   originate on the Astral and Mental levels; they in turn filter down 
   and intermingle with the physical plane.
  </P>
  <P>
   You might say that the consciousness is a spirit waiting to be born 
   and that it is born into infinity. The spirit to be is encased in the 
   matter of the astral and the mental. The excess weight must be 
   chipped away, until the spirit is freed for its continued journey to 
   the SOURCE.
  </P>
  <P>
   For many people the astral and mental levels, through the process 
   referred to as Karma, is like a snowball rolling down a hill. As time 
   passes it gets larger and larger. And the entity within is encased 
   more and more in Karmic webs and Karmic patterns. These layers, if 
   you will, are strong energizers that affect the automaton that we 
   refer to as the physical vehicle. This automaton can be controlled by 
   the consciousness but it is also driven by the matter; the 
   elementals, if you will, that comprise the mental and the astral 
   planes. And so you have opposing forces here. You have the 
   consciousness waiting to be born; waiting to be freed from its prison 
   of encased matter and you have the prison itself wishing to remain 
   intact and constantly building upon itself due to reactionary patterns.
  </P>
  <P>
   When one dies and passes from the physical vehicle, he is temporarily 
   freed and floats up as was mentioned before, but the matter that 
   comprises these vehicles is carried also because it is not physical 
   matter as such. It is a form of matter that is not recognized by your 
   science. But it is matter none the less and it is magnetized towards 
   the physical plane in a process that is quite unique to the earth's sphere.
  </P>
  <P>
   The earth's sphere is a unique specimen in this universe. It was 
   constructed for a specific purpose and it has served that purpose 
   almost too well in that it is very difficult for an incarnating 
   entity to break through the encasements on the astral and mental 
   levels. And they are constantly adding to these levels until the 
   consciousness realizes what is occurring and starts the processes of 
   slowing the momentum down the hill, so to speak, that is accumulating 
   more Karma. And begins the process of chipping away at all the events 
   and emotions that have accumulated within the matter of the astral 
   and mental levels.
  </P>
  <P>
   And this can take several life times once the consciousness is aware. 
   This is what we refer to as the path back to the SOURCE, or the path 
   back to the true self. It is important to remove yourself from 
   identification with your physical vehicle. And the reactions and 
   constructs that comprise the Astral and mental levels. This is the 
   key to slowing the momentum of Karmic accumulation and it is the way 
   to begin shedding the weight of the accumulated Karma.
  </P>
  <P>
   By following through with both methodologies, the initiate or student 
   of the path begins to make progress and speeds up the vibrations. As 
   each bit of accumulated ASTRAL and MENTAL matter is discarded, the 
   elementals that form them are actually dissipated back into the 
   environment and a literal weight is indeed shed. You can look upon 
   this as if you had a problem in your life that you suddenly resolved 
   and most people will describe it as if a great weight had been lifted 
   from their being. Think about that because it admirably demonstrates 
   what I am saying here.
  </P>
  <P>
   Now look upon it in this manner, after a certain amount of weight is 
   shed, you notice more lightness but then you acclimate to it and once 
   again you notice the weight. This is why the lifting of the burden 
   seems to be temporary. However the progress made is a permanent 
   progress if you follow the requirements of the path. That weight that 
   is shed is permanently gone from your being. Then it is time to 
   tackle the next amount of weight that must be shed.
  </P>
  <P>
   A great portion of the earth plane is devoted towards the 
   interactions of entities. It is the interaction of entities that 
   actually create the earth plane. It in turn is a living 
   consciousness; a living being. And you might say that the entities 
   that live upon this planet are in a symbiotic relationship with the 
   planet. Each feed into the other. Unfortunately there has been a 
   trend of humanity, certain phases of humanity, to change the 
   symbiotic relationship to one of a parasitic relationship. If you 
   recall the nature of a parasitic relationship, a parasite will attach 
   itself to the host and it will eventually destroy the host even 
   though it needs the host for continued survival. And this is what 
   certain facets of mankind has done.
  </P>
  <P>
   And the host, which is this planet, is sick. It is ill and as with 
   any ill organism, it seeks to remedy itself; to destroy that which is 
   causing its illness. In terms of the planet earth, it is humanity 
   that is causing its illness and the planet is readying itself to 
   purge the parasites that are damaging it.
  </P>
  <P>
   Now you have wondered what it is that one must do to shake off this 
   excess weight that is keeping you a prisoner here. Obviously simply 
   dying does not free you from this situation or free you from coming 
   back to the physical plane. The magnetic attraction to the weight is 
   too strong. The key to resolving this excess weight lies in the area 
   of attitudes, beliefs and emotional reactions. The attitudes and 
   beliefs comprise the mental plane. The emotions comprise the astral plane.
  </P>
  <P>
   You will find that the astral plane is closest to the physical plane 
   and is a great impediment to reaching and objectively analyzing that 
   which resides on the mental plane. And so, the primary task of those 
   entering the path of evolution is to overcome emotional reactions. 
   And I believe that in the future others of our committee will be 
   instructing for various ways to accomplish this.
  </P>
  <P>
   But set your minds to it, contemplate it, think about it. See if you 
   can neutralize your emotional reactions be it fear, anger or even 
   what is termed in this society as positive emotions; what is 
   classified as love or caring, because any great emotion serves as a 
   weight. There is a difference between caring and the emotion that 
   embroils many of the people in this society. And that we will go into 
   in more detail at a later time. But you must think about emotions. 
   They are neither inherently bad or good but they serve as a weight, 
   as a magnetic influence to draw you back to the physical plane. And 
   if they are so strongly ingrained they will keep you on a low level 
   when you make the death transition. And you can wander around in a 
   fog for a long time.
  </P>
  <P>
   The mental plane is comprised of events; events that have shaped 
   attitudes and beliefs. These attitudes and beliefs color your views 
   of reality. And they can serve as impediments to your growth; 
   impediments to your evolution. That also will be gone into in more 
   detail at a later time when we deal with these issues in more detail. 
   And so, that is the follow up to one phase of the discussion 
   presented the last time by Lodge.
  </P>
  <P>
   Formulate your questions and we will design a system whereby we can 
   attend to them. 'Tis best that you write them down and we will 
   perhaps designate one individual to ask them and that way you will 
   not have to be concerned about when to speak and when not to speak.
  </P>
  <P>
   And with that I bid you a good evening although the energies are 
   quite flowing tonight in startling contrast to the way they were the 
   last time. But we feel that that is sufficient for you to think about.
  </P>
  <P>
   Good evening.
