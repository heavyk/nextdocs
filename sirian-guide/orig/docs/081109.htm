            <p><FONT SIZE=4>I bid you a good evening. Doyle here. Let us continue.</font></p>
            <p><FONT SIZE=4>I cannot stress the importance of each circle participant 
            being of positive mind for the work at hand.</font></p>
            <p><FONT SIZE=4>Should a negative person participate, it is likely 
            to prevent the Spiritual manifestation. Thus, it is important to 
            choose your circle participants wisely.</font></p>
            <p><FONT SIZE=4>When you have established the participants, it is 
            important to set the mood with positive talk of Spiritual topics.</font></p>
            <p><FONT SIZE=4>Setting the expectation for the Spiritual manifestation, 
            this talk needs to lift the mood of the circle members, as well 
            as allowing them to relax and detach themselves from the material 
            world [with] unity of purpose to make contact with the Spiritual 
            realms.</font></p>
            <p><FONT SIZE=4>Now let us discuss the early or beginning stages 
            of the circle. You likely will not have a medium to start. However, 
            the purpose of the circle is to discover and nurture the latent 
            medium.</font></p>
            <p><FONT SIZE=4>Thus, you may not have results to begin with but 
            by following the form on a regular basis, the one with mediumistic 
            talent will eventually begin the task of mediumship.</font></p>
            <p><FONT SIZE=4>So, we have our circle members selected for their 
            positive outlook of a thirst for Spiritual knowledge. A medium is 
            not necessarily present at this time but one will eventually appear, 
            either by development or attraction of a new member. Trust that 
            the Spirits will guide you.</font></p>
            <p><FONT SIZE=4>After you have spent the preliminary time on positive 
            Spiritual topics, it is time to begin the process.</font></p>
            <p><FONT SIZE=4>First, let's discuss the environment of the room. 
            Ideally, there should be a table around which everyone can sit. 
            If this is not possible, the chairs should be in a circle.</font></p>
            <p><FONT SIZE=4>Having fresh flowers of a wonderful aroma will help 
            balance the atmosphere.... placing them in the center is best.</font></p>
            <p><FONT SIZE=4>Next, the room temperature should be comfortable 
            for the circle members need to be relaxed.</font></p>
            <p><FONT SIZE=4>As for lighting, a dim light source is best. All 
            distraction needs to be removed. We shall pause at this point.</font></p>
            <p><FONT SIZE=4>I bid you a good evening.</font></p>
            <p><FONT SIZE=4>To be continued.</font></p>
