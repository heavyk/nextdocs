   Inside the cylinder, there is suddenly a brilliant blue light and a 
   hum. the hum starts out fairly low-pitched and picks up in intensity. 
   It's not the intensity of the sound, it is the frequency getting 
   higher and higher causing the sound pitch to change.
  </P>
  <P>
   As the frequency gets higher, I start getting bigger. When the sound 
   stops and the light returns to white, I'm adult sized. I don't look 
   like me, like my current adult version, I look different but there 
   are some similarities.
  </P>
  <P>
   Rather than the kid clothes I arrived in, I now have on coveralls 
   like the personnel I saw in the hanger. The extra-terrestrial driving 
   the shuttle device had on little moccasin type shoes. They're soft 
   but have somewhat of a sole on them and now I'm wearing some myself.
  </P>
  <P>
   Obviously, some serious matter transformation occurred. I felt really 
   charged, really energized. The door of the cylinder reappeared. When 
   I came out, everyone else was coming out too and everyone is 
   different; full size adults wearing the same coverall type of clothes.
  </P>
  <P>
   The one thing I quickly notice is that everyone looks ageless. By 
   this I mean almost an ephemeral quality. I can't really describe it 
   any other way. We're in different bodies but not really. It's a 
   rearrangement our bodies.
  </P>
  <P>
   It seems that the blue light in the cylinder corresponded with my 
   vibration and that the others had different colored lights in their 
   cylinders that corresponded to them.
  </P>
  <P>
   So, I have this feeling of, &quot;Well, it's good to feel normal 
   again,&quot; type of reaction.
  </P>
  <P>
   The little room with the transformation cylinders has an entrance to 
   another rectangular room that now appears in the wall. We enter this 
   larger room that is also rectangular. As I mentioned, there are NO 
   sharp corners. Where joints meet, it is rounded.
  </P>
  <P>
   In this larger room, there is what reminds me of a conference table. 
   We go in and sit down on one side of it and a group of male and 
   female extra-terrestrials, dressed similarly to ourselves, sits down 
   on the other side.
  </P>
  <P>
   This seems to be a information exchange session. They are asking us 
   our impressions of being in our other form. They ask us how we like 
   being in our regular form and the general consensus is that it 
   stinks. It is too primitive.
  </P>
  <P>
   The extra-terrestrials say that they are working on enhancements to 
   it that they will introduce over time, to improve it's capacity, 
   whatever that means.
  </P>
  <P>
   They say that their main limitation is that they can't alter our 
   physical forms too much or we could be readily identifiable to humans 
   with even their primitive technology. Hummm, this is interesting. If 
   we aren't humans as such, what are we?
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   In following the flow of this experience, detailed information will 
   have to be presented separately in another article on the topics 
   discussed at this meeting with the extra-terrestrials because the 
   information was presented as if it was already known with no explanation.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Some background information is necessary for the next section. When I 
   was a child, I never felt related to my biological family. The older 
   I got, the more pronounced this lack of identification with my family 
   and feeling of not belonging to them became. Thus, I was constantly 
   seeking information about my birth because I had come to the 
   conclusion that I was adopted. What other logical conclusion can you 
   draw? Whenever I asked my father when I was born, he would always say 
   the same thing, &quot;You weren't born, you were hatched.&quot; This 
   really aggravated me as a child. No matter how many times I asked the 
   question, that is what he ALWAYS said. My father did have a sarcastic 
   sense of humor, but his persistence on this topic was unusual even 
   for him.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   So, this next part of the story is dedicated to my father who passed 
   on in 1991. You were right Dad, I was hatched.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Returning to the experience. Here we are in a rectangular conference 
   room inside of a mountain; two 4 year olds, a 15 year old, an 18 year 
   old and someone approximately 22 or 23. All TRANSFORMED into adults. 
   Physically PERFECT adults I might add.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   A group of very human extra-terrestrials are sitting there calmly 
   talking with us like a business meeting. The conference table is oval 
   shaped. Our transformed selves look similar to the extra-terrestrials 
   sitting across from us. I know for myself that I felt and acted like 
   a totally mature adult who knew the details of what was being discussed.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   The extra-terrestrials at the meeting had their individual 
   distinctions. There are four of them; two men and two women. Three of 
   them have that ageless quality but one of the men doesn't. He looks 
   more mature and appears to be the group leader.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   One of the extra-terrestrial women is blond, one has black hair; both 
   with a page boy type shortness. The other extra-terrestrial male has 
   sort of a sandy colored hair. Those three look like the bodies we 
   were transformed into.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   As I mentioned, they asked how we liked the form we were in and the 
   general concensus was that it was too limiting. They told us that 
   they were working to improve the physical situation, to provide 
   enhancements, but had to work within parameters so that we would not 
   be detected. That we had physical enemies that must not know who, or 
   I suppose what, we were.
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Then they started talking about how we would contribute to a new 
   generation from the genetic materials contained in our current body 
   cells and how the new generation, literally our offspring, would have 
   greater, enhanced capabilities. These new &quot;people&quot; would 
   enter the world in a time when things were different and it was safe 
   to do so.
