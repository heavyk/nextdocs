  <P>
   I thought I was going to Graduate School to get additional skills for 
   a job. However, that apparently was not the primary purpose.
  </P>
  <P>
   Graduate School is a completely different world than college. You 
   have to &quot;fit in&quot; with the conventions of the department. 
   Well, I've never been one for &quot;fitting in&quot; and I quickly 
   found myself placed with a small group of others who tended to be 
   fiercely independent and open minded. It was one of these people who 
   gave me the tools to OPEN THE DOOR.
  </P>
  <P>
   It was in the form of two life altering books. The first, 
   &quot;Self-Hypnotism: It's Use in Daily Living&quot; by Leslie 
   Lecron, was given to me by this individual. In addition I was told 
   that I needed to read &quot;Journeys Out of the Body&quot; by Robert 
   Monroe and that I could find it at the University Library.
  </P>
  <P>
   Lecron's book was a key and Monroe's book offered an explanation for 
   self-understanding. That in turn made the tools offered by Lecron 
   more effective.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;Journeys Out of the Body&quot; explained to me experiences that 
   I'd had since childhood. But more importantly, it prepared me for 
   experiences I was yet to have.
  </P>
  <P>
   &quot;Self-Hypnotism: It's Use in Daily Living&quot; introduced me to 
   hypnosis, subconscious communication and automatic writing. Actually, 
   not just an introduction but HOW TO.
  </P>
  <P>
   I started practicing self-hypnosis right away. I also developed the 
   pendulum movements for subconscious communication. With the simple 
   pendulum, I discovered that my subconscious was willing to tell me 
   all about myself, even the nontraditional topics such as reincarnation.
  </P>
  <P>
   I practiced self-hypnosis, going to deeper and deeper levels, several 
   times a week. I would concentrate on becoming totally relaxed and 
   repeat the deepening formula mentally over and over. It always 
   fascinated me that even though the process could take up to two 
   hours, it only seemed like 15 minutes.
  </P>
  <P>
   I didn't realize that I had taken the first steps to becoming a 
   Channeler. At the time I was just trying to get more into my subconscious.
  </P>
  <P>
   Over time, I became quite efficient at going really deep. One night, 
   I had gone extremely deep and was ready to reverse the process. I did 
   the usual count up to return to the normal levels. And, I thought I'd 
   returned to the normal levels. I got up but felt sort of strange. 
   There was a pulling sensation at the back of my head where the bone 
   bump sticks out. I walked downstairs, my head tilted slightly back 
   and into the den observing the people that were there. Everything 
   seemed to have sort of a misty haze over it. At this point, I 
   realized that I was ASTRALLY PROJECTED! I studied the scene to 
   remember how things looked and walked back upstairs, laid back down 
   and counted up again. This time, ALL of me got up.
  </P>
  <P>
   I quickly went back downstairs and everything was just as I had seen 
   it moments before without the haze. I was impressed by the 
   experience. I hadn't tried to produce it although I knew what it was 
   from reading Monroe's book. It simply happened and wasn't to be the 
   last conscious ASTRAL PROJECTION.
  </P>
  <P>
   I feel that the ability to ASTRALLY PROJECT is a necessary quality 
   for a clear Channeler.
