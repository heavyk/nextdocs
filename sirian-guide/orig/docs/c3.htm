   I knew that I had to change my curriculum. I pondered the courses I 
   had taken sorting them out to find what I liked best. It seemed that 
   Psychology was my best subject. However, I discovered I had a mental 
   block. In blunt terms, I was literally afraid that, if I got into the 
   field of Psychology, I would find out things about myself that I <B>did
    not</B> want to know.
  </P>
  <P>
   Although it sounds ridiculous, this issue created a great deal of 
   conflict for me. I had never contemplated that there were things 
   about myself that I didn't know or didn't want to know. I anguished 
   for weeks on the matter but kept being drawn back to Psychology as 
   the subject I liked best and at which I excelled. I finally came to 
   the conclusion that if there were things about myself that I didn't 
   know, they were affecting me anyway so it would be best to know 
   whatever it was. In truth, I did discover more about myself than I 
   ever imagined but it took a few years.
  </P>
  <P>
   With the conflict settled, I continued reading Jane Robert's books 
   and other psychic related books. During school, I never had time for 
   outside reading and was only able to do so during breaks.
  </P>
  <P>
   With the resumption of the next school term, I was in the field of 
   Psychology. I didn't discover any startling revelations about myself 
   so I thought my concerns had been unfounded. Little did I know at the 
   time that every aspect of what I learned would push me in a direction 
   that would open doors that had been closed all my life.
  </P>
  <P>
   I completed my Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology and started 
   looking for a job. They didn't exist. I even looked at substandard 
   work in the field but nothing was available, not even for someone who 
   had graduated with honors.
  </P>
  <P>
   In looking back, it is obvious that an outside force was disrupting 
   my job aspirations. This is demonstrated by the fact that I had a 
   successful job interview at a mental health center in a distant city. 
   The director, the boss, was very impressed with me and tried to get 
   me a position. He even called me several times at my residence trying 
   to work out details for several different positions because he wanted 
   me on his staff. However, it never happened. Not even with the 
   director wanting me on the staff. In a mental health center, the 
   director is usually the final authority on who gets hired. Thus, I 
   can only assume that an outside force was influencing the situation 
   and disrupting the normal flow of events. This was not the first 
   external manipulation. It is clear to me that my strange illness was 
   too although I wasn't aware of it at the time.
  </P>
  <P>
   So, after several months, I found myself at the local university and 
   in Graduate School. Outside forces were shaping my destiny and I 
   didn't realize it. THE DOOR WAS ABOUT TO OPEN.
