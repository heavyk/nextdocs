  </P>
  <P>
   Dear children and beloved colleagues. It is I Kathumi returning once 
   again to continue with our presentation of the creation. Hopefully as 
   we continue, many of your questions shall be answered. It is fitting 
   at this point to re-emphasize some of the earlier material.
  </P>
  <P>
   One point that needs to be mentioned is the construction by the 
   elders and the primary triads of a form with which they were familiar 
   in the previous universe. This form exists well above that which was 
   created. In a sense it is a carry over or an anchoring point from the 
   previous universe and this construction was and is the base of 
   operation of those designated as the creators. And it is also what 
   has been distorted in recent times as the conception of heaven. In a 
   sense the creation process started from the top and went down and 
   branched off from this construction.
  </P>
  <P>
   Another point that needs to be emphasized is that the elders did not 
   actively participate in the creation process. It was up to their 
   creations, their sons and daughters, to do the actual creating.
  </P>
  <P>
   In this system of philosophy that we are presenting, the elders are 
   referred to as the <B>first life wave</B> and their creations, the 
   primary triads, are referred to as the <B>second life wave</B>.
  </P>
  <P>
   Where we left off the last time, the primary triads were creating the 
   consciousness vehicles that would serve as the life forms of the 
   Universe. These were created and stored to be used at a later time 
   because the Universe at this stage did not exist. So the creation 
   process continued until a sufficient number of consciousness vehicles 
   were created to populate the boundaries of the new Universe.
  </P>
  <P>
   The next step of the creation was to begin building the actual 
   structure of the Universe. It was decided that for this Universe 
   there would be seven layers, seven planes of existence. And so each 
   layer was created from the top down. We shall use the terms for them 
   that have been used for the last hundred years. They are convenience; 
   merely labels.
  </P>
  <P>
   It is difficult to convey to your consciousnesses what the top-most 
   portions are like. So the first plane of existence that was created 
   was the Monad level. This level represents the highest frequency of 
   vibration that the consciousnesses of the present Universe can 
   attain; it is the reaction point. When a sufficient amount of 
   consciousnesses in this Universe reach this level then this Universe 
   will translate as the previous one did. And so for the 
   consciousnesses in this Universe, this is the highest that they can 
   attain until sufficient numbers collect to allow the transition and 
   the subsequent creation of the next Universe.
  </P>
  <P>
   The next level down is what we refer to as the Atmic. Again, this 
   level is too abstract to convey into words at this time. The Monad 
   level is pure energy from a very high frequency. Form as such does 
   not exist on it, the Atmic level is quite similar.
  </P>
  <P>
   The third level down is the Buddhic level, the level below it is the 
   Abstract Mind level and the level below it is the Soul level. Further 
   down is the Mental level, then the Astral level and thus were created 
   the seven planes of existence.
  </P>
  <P>
   And so you ask, &quot;Where does that leave the physical?&quot; And 
   that is a special part of the story of which we will tell later.
  </P>
  <P>
   So getting back to the creation process, the seven planes were 
   constructed. It would be incomprehensible to your consciousnesses to 
   understand how they were constructed. Suffice it to say that the 
   entities that created them could manipulate energy and transmute 
   energy into various forms and consciousnesses. And structure it and 
   work with the consciousnesses to make the various forms.
  </P>
  <P>
   And so now perhaps you can see where the myths of the seven days of 
   creation, six active days and the seventh day of rest which was 
   convenient and why your time is measured in a seven day cycle 
   referred to as a week. Once again a symbolic representation of the 
   original creation.
  </P>
  <P>
   And so the various forms and structures were put into play. The Soul 
   level was the mid-point at this time of the original creation. It was 
   the point where the consciousnesses were given the necessary 
   faculties to start at the Astral level working to learn and evolve; 
   to begin their climb upwards to the ultimate collection point of the 
   Monad level.
  </P>
  <P>
   And so on these two lowest levels, the Astral level and the Mental 
   level, what you would classify as forms were created. With each step 
   up these forms were represented all the way unto the Monad level, but 
   each upward representation was of a higher vibration and symbolic in 
   nature so that it did not necessarily match that of its lower element 
   on the plane below it.
  </P>
  <P>
   It would be very difficult to put a time span on how long it took to 
   create the seven planes of reality. However it took longer than in 
   terms of earth years than your scientists have currently calculated.
  </P>
  <P>
   And so referring back to our stored consciousness vehicles, they 
   needed a school; they needed playgrounds; dwellings; all things 
   necessary for the growth and development of children. And so the 
   primary triads constructed all these things on the Astral and Mental levels.
  </P>
  <P>
   The perfect shape in the Universe is a sphere and thus collection 
   points in the shape of spheres were created. On the physical plane 
   you refer to these as planets. Energy sources were installed which 
   you could correlate with suns; quasars; black holes; all of these 
   strange structures that your scientists are beginning to discover out 
   in what is called space.
  </P>
  <P>
   And so the forms were readied, the educational structures were 
   created and all was going smoothly or so it seemed in, to use the 
   analogy, heaven. So all the structures existed but that which you 
   call life. This was still in the storage sections. There had to be a 
   place or something to send these consciousnesses to and so the seven 
   planes of existence or the seven levels or the seven days were created.
  </P>
  <P>
   Then began the distribution process of the consciousness vehicles. 
   For this to occur, it was necessary to create forms that the 
   consciousness vehicles would enliven or animate. And the creators 
   designed these forms to be much like themselves - they had the 
   positive, the negative and the neutral charges. Thus the saying that 
   God created man in his own image which is in a sense humorous because 
   at the level of creation, there is no, what you would classify, 
   physical image. It is energy but that's another issue.
  </P>
  <P>
   And so the forms were created, the bodies were created, if you will, 
   to reside on the Astral plane, which at this time was the lowest 
   level of creation. And these forms were created from the materials of 
   the Astral plane. Again an understanding of where God created the 
   bodies out of the mud and the dust. So these structures were created. 
   And as each structure was created, it was enlivened by the 
   consciousness vehicle and thus the inhabitants of the Universe were 
   set into motion.
  </P>
  <P>
   These vehicles that they inhabited were enduring vehicles. They did 
   not need to reproduce as is necessary on the physical plane. You 
   might say they never wore out; they lived forever. But then there was 
   no time as such.
  </P>
  <P>
   And so the stored consciousness vehicles were animated in cycles. In 
   other words, even though all the consciousness vehicles were created 
   essentially at the same time, they were not animated at the same 
   time. And so in terms of evolution, there is a differential between 
   entities; some have been enlivened if you will or have more 
   experience in the Universe.
  </P>
  <P>
   But the first crop of children; the first crop we shall discuss in 
   our next segment because it was with the first crop and subsequent 
   crops that problems developed.
  </P>
  <P>
   It was mentioned earlier in your discussion as to my credentials and 
   we entities as such do not have credentials. We have no diplomas 
   hanging on our walls because we have no walls. Suffice it to say that 
   I am among those that were first animated; the original first crop of 
   children as it were for I am of this Universe and working to see that 
   it does translate and grows for the even bigger and better production 
   of the <B>third life wave</B>.
  </P>
  <P>
   We hope that over time, some of these confusions will be removed and 
   your consciousnesses can have a better understanding of your nature 
   and who and what you are.
  </P>
  <P>
   In the next segment we shall discuss more about those first 
   animations of consciousness vehicles and at that point shall begin 
   the element of the damaged entities from the previous Universe.
  </P>
  <P>
   And so I give my blessings upon each and everyone of you. Open your 
   minds; seek wisdom; seek to evolve; to attain your highest being; to 
   reunite yourself with your highest self. Until next time, Good evening.
