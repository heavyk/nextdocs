What is CHANNELING?Channeling is serving as a conduit for information 
   that originates from a living being, usually in non-physical form. In 
   the middle 1800's, an entire movement was built around CHANNELING - SPIRITUALISM.
  </P>
  <P>
   Can anyone CHANNEL?NO. It is a talent that not everyone has. Just as 
   everyone can't be a concert violinist or a champion figure skater. 
   Unfortunately, many people think they can CHANNEL because, unlike the 
   violinist or skater, there is no visible skill involved. Only words.
  </P>
  <P>
   Do CHANNELERS have a common quality?YES. An individual that has the 
   capacity to CHANNEL has a very strong life energy flow capacity. 
   However, a strong energy flow is not the only requirement.
  </P>
  <P>
   Does CHANNELING just happen?NO. Even the person with the talent for 
   CHANNELING has to develop over a period of years. It involves much 
   work and a detachment of self so that the information flow is not 
   influenced by the ego. A true CHANNEL always doubts the material and 
   strives to insure that it is genuinely not from themselves.
  </P>
  <P>
   Why is so much material from Extra-Terrestrials derived from 
   CHANNELING?Many of the Extra-Terrestrials are not physical; their 
   vibrational pattern is so high that we cannot see them. So, it is 
   necessary for them to have a physical anchor to communicate. Other 
   E.T.s life energy is so high that it is disruptive to normal humans, 
   thus, it is safer for them to communicate indirectly through a CHANNEL.
  </P>
  <P>
   Is SPIRITUALISM applicable in the present?YES. You see, 
   Extra-Terrestrials were responsible for the creation of SPIRITUALISM. 
   They created and enhanced the phenomena that held the entire world's 
   attention for more than 50 years. A person interested in 
   Extra-Terrestrials would benefit from the study of SPIRITUALISM. It 
   must be remembered that the culture of the late 19th and early 20th 
   century had no frame of reference for Extra-Terrestrials but even so, 
   some of the material of SPIRITUALISM, although only a small portion, 
   concerns Extra-Terrestrials.
  </P>
  <P>
   Can you believe CHANNELED information?As with any information, its 
   value is what it means to the individual. If something is meaningful 
   to you, then it doesn't matter whether it came from a book, a person 
   or was CHANNELED.
  </P>
  <P>
   Are there books that give an overview of CHANNELING or 
   SPIRITUALISM?YES. A contemporary book is by John G. Fuller, THE 
   AIRMEN WHO WOULD NOT DIE. A classic is THE HISTORY OF SPIRITUALISM by 
   Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
