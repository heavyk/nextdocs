   <FONT SIZE=4>INTUITION</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Intuition - the process of knowing without ratiocination 
   - is a faculty developed by the functioning of the connection to the 
   BUDDHIC vehicle.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Much more precise information can be gathered this way 
   than by depending on the ASTRAL record reading or feeling. Things 
   upon the ASTRAL are a reversal of the BUDDHIC. Here is a hint as to 
   the problem people have with reversals; the connections between the 
   Spiritual Triad have not become completely dominant over the physical 
   faculties and the CONCRETE MIND confuses the two sets of impulses. 
   Discrimination has to be taught to the CONCRETE MIND so that it can 
   render unto the physical that which is physical and unto the 
   spiritual that which is of its kind. If you are interested, we could 
   give you some helpful suggestions for adults and children with the 
   problem of reversals.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The BUDDHIC plane faculty of intuition is one that is 
   easier for even rays. There is another faculty that stems from the 
   ATMIC plane that odd rays find easier to deal with in obtaining 
   &quot;knowing&quot;. This will be discussed when we talk about the 
   that plane.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Later in the course, we'll give processes for the 
   development of intuitional functioning. For now, it is sufficient for 
   you to be aware that it is a faculty that you will develop and to be 
   on the look out for it.</FONT>

   <FONT SIZE=3>EXERCISE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIGHT VEHICLE</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>To practice this exercise, orient your feet towards the 
   approximate location of Sirius which can be determined with a star 
   chart wheel.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>1. Process: lay on the floor, or a bed if you can orient 
   in the correction direction, which is toward Sirius. Establish a 
   slow, deep breathing, from the abdomen. Concentrate your attention on 
   the abdomen and breathing with it. Maintain this throughout the 
   entire process.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>2. As you continue the deep breathing from the abdomen, 
   you will notice a lightness or tingling sensation at the base of the 
   spine. Soon your body will lighten up from your head to your feet.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>3. Begin to visualize this lightness as a luminance; the 
   light vehicle. By will, begin exuding the light vehicle out all 
   around you for about two inches; as if to alleviate the effects of gravity.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>4. When you have felt the lightness and the Light 
   vehicle extends approximately two inches from your physical body, 
   tell it to stand up in front of you and see it doing so in your 
   mind's eye.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>5. Contemplate the Light vehicle; examine all its 
   details. Notice how its separation from your physical body affects 
   the physical body.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>6. When you have completed your examination, tell the 
   Light vehicle to merge back into your physical body. Feel it resuming 
   it normal orientation within the body.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>7. Notice the difference with the re-entry of the Light vehicle.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>8. Return to the normal levels of conscious.</FONT>
