  <TITLE>Life After Death: Knowledge to Dispel Fear - Part 3 byDK,Djwhal
   Kulh</TITLE>
  <META NAME="description" CONTENT="In 1985, Djwhal Kuhl, known to many as DK, presented a series of lectures on a topic that most people would prefer not to think about...death. As he so aptly pointed out, it is an experience that everyone without exception will eventually face. The intent of these lectures was to emphasize that life is eternal and what we believe in life determines what we will experience in the afterlife. The message is clear, death is not to be feared, it is a change. It is not the end, it is a beginning.">

   A Channeled Lecture by Djwahl Kuhl (DK) Presented April 12, 1985

   <FONT SIZE=3>[EDITOR'S NOTE: THE FOLLOWING IS A VERBATIM TRANSCRIPT 
   FROM THE SESSION TAPE. WORDS ADDED FOR CLARITY WILL BE IN [ ], WORDS 
   OMITTED WILL BE DENOTED BY ..... THE REST IS JUST AS IT WAS SPOKEN]</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Greetings to you along the path it is I D.K., tonight we 
   shall continue our presentation of life after death.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>An individual follows a normal two to four week 
   preparation period prior to death. The transition is made much 
   easier. As you will recall, the transition period involves 
   disengagement from the physical(a loosening of the binds to the 
   physical body and the physical plane). As the actual time of 
   departure approaches the individual begins to respond more to 
   non-physical (for lack of a better word &quot;things&quot;).</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Entities known to the individual come to serve as guides 
   of the actual passing. These guides could be loved ones that have 
   gone before or non-physicals that have served as the link between the 
   spiritual and the physical for the individual. The individual may 
   actually see these non-physical forms or dream of them depending on 
   the method of departure. If the method of departure is sudden such as 
   a fatal heart attack, a stroke, or an accident, the individual 
   usually dreams and recalls these dreams prior to the event. If the 
   departure is a slow one in which the consciousness is still active, 
   the person will usually perceive the non-physical levels as the final 
   disengagement from the physical vehicle occurs. The individual who 
   follows the slow transition has less of a recovery time than the 
   other forms of departure.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>At this point it is appropriate to mention belief 
   structures and conflicts that may arise during the transition period. 
   The beliefs in Western Society of either an idea of heaven or an 
   ever-lasting hell or an abyss of nothingness serves to interfere with 
   the natural transition. An individual who holds such belief 
   structures experiences agitation, anxiety and depression prior to the 
   final departure. They may blind themselves to the non-physical 
   assistance that is there awaiting them; they may refuse to see; 
   refuse to accept the fact of their transition.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The bodily consciousness (what you refer to as the 
   pre-conscious) fights to continue it's existence. This serves to 
   weight the person down, to cause disruption in the natural process 
   and to blind them from the help that is there from the higher levels. 
   We have found that it is better for an individual to have absolutely 
   no thoughts or no beliefs of life after death, as opposed to the 
   heaven, hell or nothingness that many people conceptualize. The 
   reason for this is that the emotions are less activated and the 
   person does not blind themselves to the non-physical forms of 
   assistance that are there waiting.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>During the transition period part of the process 
   involves teachings from the non-physical levels in an attempt to calm 
   the emotional vehicle; to neutralize negative beliefs. However, this 
   is only marginally effective from this level for the individual is a 
   function of their belief system. The belief system structures 
   perceptions. In most instances the teachings do not reach the 
   conscious level. This is why sensitives on your plane naturally 
   attempt to calm and soothe a person that they perceive entering the 
   transition phase.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>And so the point of departure is reached. The entity 
   sheds the physical shell and launches into an extended, and in a 
   sense of the body that was left, a permanent astral projection. And 
   what does the entity perceive at this point?</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This of course depends upon the beliefs, the 
   effectiveness of the transition period, and the openness to 
   non-physical sources of assistance. For most people immediately 
   following departure they find themselves erect, thinking, breathing, 
   functioning except no one can see them. They see in many instances a 
   body lying there, but being on the outside of the body looking in. 
   For many it takes considerable time to realize that that was them; 
   that was their body. When this realization takes effect, despair, 
   grief, depression sets in, disbelief is also a key item.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>You see, the emotions do not stop with departure from 
   the physical plane. They are there none the less. The individual 
   still walks and talks and pleads with the physical forms that it so 
   clearly can perceive ...., strangers; acquaintances; loved ones; 
   begging; pleading for recognition; for assistance. (Of course few if 
   any respond to the pleas). The individual is at a loss. He can only 
   go back and attempt to re-enter the shell that once was home. This 
   does not work. In many instances the entity lingers around the body 
   even after interment. At this time non-physicals are attempting to 
   break through into the reality base of the departed. In many 
   instances this is successful within three to five earth days, but 
   there is always a percentage of entities that remain in this fixed 
   state for an indefinite period of time. This is the state that has 
   been referred to as &quot;purgatory&quot; and those in such a fixed 
   state are best reached by those still living.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>When the entity, the departed entity, finally accepts 
   the concept of death, that he is dead, he is confused. He does not 
   see what he expected to see. In many instances he walks the physical 
   plane and responds to the physical plane just as he did in the 
   physical body. With some, the realization of death activates whatever 
   set of beliefs, expectations, that the individual held to be true. 
   Some find themselves confronted by winged creatures in white with 
   halos, playing harps to fly them away to heaven. Very few people ever 
   construct a scenario of hell complete with fire and the devil. The 
   angel in heaven scenario is much more common. For others, everything 
   fades away into a grayness; a thick murky lifeless existence. This is 
   confusing to them for their consciousness still exists. They believed 
   that all would cease at death.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Depending on the strength of the beliefs these scenes 
   continue for indefinite periods of time. These individuals are as if 
   asleep. They are seen by other non-physicals but as one who is a 
   sleep walker; they do not in turn see what is occurring around them. 
   They see the illusions that their beliefs create for them. And unlike 
   a sleep walker who can be awakened by activation of the physical 
   senses, the non-physicals have difficulty awakening such an entity. 
   This state of being is perhaps the worst possible condition that a 
   departed entity can create for self. This is worse than any of the 
   imagined punishments that have been constructed by the minds of men 
   as punishment from a seemingly benevolent creator.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The important point of the transmission tonight is that 
   beliefs of a heaven, beliefs of a hell, beliefs of nothingness are 
   detrimental to the individual at the time of death. These beliefs 
   retard the development, fixate the entity in &quot;Limbo&quot; for an 
   indefinite period of time. Growth, evolution is halted during this 
   period. It is important to create a system that will neutralize these 
   beliefs in people.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The subject of death is one that few contemplate until 
   the end approaches. Then you find many people grasping for something 
   be it religion or consolation in nothingness. Neither approach is of 
   benefit; neither approach takes into consideration the purpose of 
   life and why the exiting of life is necessary as is the entrance. We 
   shall talk more on the state of death in future transmissions. We 
   shall attempt to present understandable forms that will appeal to 
   people in general, that can perhaps at a subconscious level supersede 
   their malformed and childish conceptions of life after death that 
   many hold.</FONT>
