  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Intergalactic councils for purposes such as interchange 
   of ideas and advisory groups were formed as soon as beings evolved 
   into the GALACTIC MIND. It was within such a council that the plan 
   evolved for a planet that became Earth. There had been an inherited 
   problem from the previous life wave and instead of it dissipating, it 
   showed signs of spreading.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The plan was to quarantine the infected entities. To 
   bring this about, they planned for a single star to stray away from 
   all neighboring stars and within this solar system, they would entice 
   the infected. Earth became the result; it is a planet in quarantine. 
   Twenty-one specialists in the pertinent fields of science did the 
   work on isolating the star Sol and proceeded hurriedly to establish a 
   suitable planet for life to evolve. They then set about to establish 
   life forms suitable for intelligent entities to inhabit. They wanted 
   them to be especially enticing to the infected entities of the 
   universe. All haste was needed, therefore measures were taken to 
   speed up the processes.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The Galactic council then asked for volunteers to become 
   &quot;peace corps&quot; workers among the entities within this test 
   planet. They were to monitor the planet and all of its inhabitants, 
   offering suggestions only when asked by the natives in which case 
   they could become teachers. But mostly, they were to monitor and make 
   sure that the problems of the infected entities remained isolated on Earth.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The civilization referred to as Atlantis was a result of 
   the Aliens helpfulness. Although it was almost a debacle for the very 
   purposes that this Earth system was created. Humanity was child like 
   and trusting at that time and it was easy for the Aliens to want to 
   help them by allowing them to see and play with Alien technology. 
   But, included within the sheep, was the scourge of the Universe - 
   &quot;GREED&quot; and it began to make itself felt within humanity 
   about 30,000 B.C.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The Aliens had grown fond of humans and considered them 
   as their children. The Aliens loved humanity and did not want to 
   believe what was taking place; that their sweet innocent charges were 
   being infiltrated and used by the old Evil. It wasn't something that 
   they wanted to cope with.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The infected seized some of the Alien technology and 
   became a threat to all life on Earth and threatened to take their 
   greed back into space. There became dissension within the Aliens as 
   to what to do with humanity as a whole, the infected ones in 
   particular and their advanced technology in general. The Aliens 
   splintered off into opposing factions which nullified any action they 
   could have taken to save the situation. Finally, when it was apparent 
   that there was real danger of the infected ones transporting 
   themselves and their problem back into space, the 21 took matters 
   over and triggered the sinking of that continent and destruction of 
   its culture.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>After the serious problem of Atlantis, it was decided 
   that the monitors and Alien workers would become as earth men so that 
   there would never again be the possibility of the infected humans 
   seizing their technology and thereby becoming a threat to the 
   Universe again.</FONT>

   <FONT SIZE=4>THE EXPERIENCES OF AN EARTHBOUND ALIEN: by K</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Aliens were as much a part of my life as any mundane 
   household chore, yet I adroitly managed to avoid facing this fact 
   until 12-14-75 when I found myself paralyzed in the knees and ankles 
   after a visit to their base. They had begun a series of energy 
   transformations on my non-physical vehicles so that my physical body 
   could withstand the influx of my Alien identity. This process took 
   six years for my present Alien identity took complete control of this 
   vehicle Friday, 1-9-81. The intervening years were filled with 
   chaotic adjustments, too often quite painful ones, but very necessary 
   for my role on this planet. I shall never forget what it was like to 
   awaken in a human body and due to human limitations, having to stand 
   helplessly by while watching the pain and suffering of humanity and 
   this planet. And ever present was the memories of my Alien capacities 
   and what I gave up to be clothed in human flesh. Will the results be 
   worth the sacrifice? I have often asked myself that question. But the 
   answer is most definitely yes; If I fulfill my purpose.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Since 1969, I had become accustomed to encountering and 
   socializing with Aliens on the physical plane as well as in the 
   sleepstate. It all began with an introduction to a very unusual man 
   whom I will call Birch. He assumed three distinctly different 
   physical appearances, yet claimed to be the same person. The anomaly 
   of this person was noticed by my neighbor who launched an 
   investigation into his identity and background. This seemed to be an 
   easy task since Birch claimed to be in the Air Force. However, the 
   Air Force claimed to have no record of such a person - ever!</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>I presented these unusual findings to Birch for 
   clarification but his response was startling. The explanation given, 
   which he told in all seriousness, was that he was an alien sent here 
   to observe humanity as a psychologist! His job was to study the 
   causes of aggression within humans so that they could better cope 
   with their own deviant aggressives! He then asked if I was making a 
   power play into their network. I was astounded and didn't know how to 
   answer him for there was then no conscious knowledge, in my mind, of 
   what he spoke of. Shortly Birch left the state offering no further explanations.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It was the month of his departure that I began an 
   intensive sleep state association with Aliens. This was initiated by 
   an Alien appearing to me, showing me a vision of Birch standing with 
   a huge red X type cross upon a bright blue disk beside him. This 
   flaming cross was beautiful and fascinating, so I watched it for what 
   seemed to be a long time. The whole disk began to rotate counter 
   clockwise moving toward me, slowly at first, then gaining speed. The 
   presenting Alien, who was standing by me, stated that the symbol was 
   being sent to me by Birch.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The adventures then began. I visited planets outside 
   this solar system, moons and walked on comets. Two of the planets 
   were easily recognized as having been my home and I longed to stay 
   there. One had two moons and was not nearly as brightly lit as the 
   earth. It was desert terrain with big boulders lying around with an 
   atmosphere that was strewn with dark clouds surrounded by glowing 
   edges. Lightning also was prevalent, dancing from cloud to cloud. 
   More than once, I stood on the surface of that planet, soaking up its 
   beauty, wishing I could stay for here was my kind and it was good not 
   to feel alone. The residents wore clothing made from some kind of 
   stiff, crinkly, pleated material. The people also glowed.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The other planet that had been my home was in a state of 
   emergency. All inhabitants were underground and seemed to be existing 
   on emergency rations. They were dressed in white jumpsuit style 
   garments complete with helmets and boots. They would regularly go on 
   surveillance missions around the planet. There seemed to have been a 
   geological disaster of huge proportions and they were attempting to 
   reverse the damage or at least to stabilize it.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Meeting with Aliens became common. The meetings ran the 
   gamut of activities: I was taught, did lab work, took pleasure 
   cruises in other types of Alien crafts. My body was often worked 
   upon. Sometimes we just socialized.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In November of 1975, three aliens came with a proposal 
   to do extensive work on my bodies that would eventually allow my 
   Alien self to manifest more fully in this human body. After their 
   second visit and discussing the ramifications upon my body - I agreed.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The event took place around 1:00 A.M. December 14th, 
   1975. I found myself lying on a table, seemingly in the middle of a 
   huge circular room, with male and female Aliens rushing around 
   getting ready to alter my energy field. I would estimate that there 
   were about fifteen Aliens all dressed in white; some quite active and 
   some observing. My consciousness was fascinated by all the gadgetry 
   around the room and my attention became riveted on a vertical 
   crystalline tube-like structure that went from floor to ceiling. I 
   thought it to be the energy source for their entire base. Huge glows 
   of various colors would build up at alternating ends, then flash 
   across the length of the tube to the other end. I could hardly wait 
   to ask them about it but I lost consciousness when they began the process.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>I regained consciousness to the voice of one of the 
   Aliens giving instructions to &quot;reverse the process.&quot; This 
   caused my conscious some concern for the Alien voice sounded like it 
   was an emergency. Further awareness dawned and with it pain! I was 
   back in bed in my house. My knees and ankles were vibrating with 
   pain. It was so great that I immediately tried to get out of bed to 
   get a pain killer for there was no way I could sleep with that pain. 
   But upon placing my feet on the floor and attempting to stand, I 
   watched in shocked disbelief as my knees and ankles simply folded up 
   beneath me and I fell to the floor.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The heretofore lark became real scary! Thoughts of being 
   paralyzed came hurriedly into my mind and I questioned my decision to 
   allow this energy alteration. I dragged myself back into bed and 
   began wondering what to do. There was no one in the house but the 
   children and they were too far away to arouse. Shortly, while I was 
   still wondering what to do, three Aliens appeared bringing me some 
   kind of white pill stating that it would kill all pain allowing me to 
   sleep until morning. I gladly took it and fell immediately asleep.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The next morning the pain was still with me but by 
   holding onto walls and doorways, I could walk. I would stumble, spill 
   things and fall around. My knees and ankles continued to give way 
   sporadically and, except for the intense pain in them, they felt 
   dead. The most painful activity was driving a car as that position 
   for my leg made the pain almost unbearable. This went on for five 
   days at which time my sister insisted that I go to see her husband, 
   who was a Doctor. I did. He ran every test he could think of and all 
   proved negative. According to medical science, there was nothing the 
   matter with me! However, the pain in my body told a different story. 
   The doctor then gave me a small dose of cortisone and the physical 
   pain left for good.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Before that event I had managed to keep all the other 
   Alien activity at bay within my thinking processes. I simply refused 
   to give it any value as to real or unreal, or form any opinions 
   concerning it. I was busy making a living, raising two kids and just 
   being very human. But the event shocked my consciousness into 
   evaluating my life, my existence, and to strongly wonder who I was 
   and what was my purpose for being here.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>My nighttime activity was drastically changed after that 
   night of energy manipulation. I began training with two Alien males 
   who were also in human form on this planet. At that time, I did not 
   know them physically but had known and worked with them for thousands 
   of years as Aliens. By June of 1977, I had meet both of them and have 
   worked with them ever since.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>After becoming accustomed to my two working partners, my 
   Alien instructors began to teach me about my Alien self; my true 
   identity; who I was and what my special attributes were that made it 
   helpful to Earth for me to be here.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>One memorable night they informed me of my Alien name. 
   It was beautiful; almost a sacred thing and I reacted like the name 
   was the most precious possession I had ever had. It was weeks before 
   I could bring myself to profane it by speaking it aloud.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>At this time also, they began to instruct me as to my 
   special function - I am a FIRST RAY female who channels and 
   manipulates energy from the SOURCE. I began to do this and loved 
   doing it. At times entities from other planets, places, or dimensions 
   would ask for my assistance which I gladly gave.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This type of instruction continued until January 9th, 
   1981 when my Alien consciousness took over my physical body.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>For six months I had been receiving messages that my 
   Alien identity was ready to take over my physical body completely. 
   Although I had been preparing for this for six years, I still didn't 
   comprehend the degree of difference there would be in my personality 
   nor the effects it would have on my physical body's functioning.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Wednesday night, January 7, 1981 my new identity began 
   to flash in and?out of consciousness. By Thursday night, I was locked 
   into this human body and found it to be very Alien to me! I began 
   going over my new situation as a human and discovered that I was 
   married with two children; none of whom I knew. My husband was my 
   twin in my Alien state but as yet he was unrecognizable to me.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Marriage sounded like a contract of ownership, so I 
   wasn't happy at finding myself owned by some man. To make matters 
   more difficult, I didn't understand the language and was having 
   difficulty speaking it. My body almost stopped functioning, food was 
   disgusting to me, and I couldn't remember how to use the bath room. I 
   was suppose to start a college calculus class the next day and was 
   worried that I wouldn't remember how to drive such a primitive device 
   as a car.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>After calculus class, which I spent observing humans, I 
   promptly went to the counseling department and ask to take a class in 
   language construction. The counselor couldn't understand what I was 
   talking about. I explained that I wished to learn how words and 
   sounds were put together in order to form logical patterns of 
   conceptions. The man gaped and told me there was &quot;no such&quot; 
   course. It was my turn to gape. I couldn't believe that the whole 
   race spoke a language for which there was no mathematical method of 
   choosing sounds to form patterns to represent concepts.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>My opinion of the inhabitants of this planet was 
   accelerating downward and I was questioning my reasoning for coming 
   here. Leaving the Counseling Department, I passed a human confined to 
   a wheel chair. Once again I gaped! It was unbelievable to me that 
   this race, having advanced as far in technology as they had, wouldn't 
   have immediately made an all out effort at healing its citizens. The 
   suffering of this person had the impact of an explosion on me; I 
   mentally and emotionally staggered under it.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Something definitely needed to be done with this place. 
   I further questioned my decision as to having precipitated onto this 
   planet. I knew, from my memory banks, that humanity spent trillions 
   of dollars every year on destructive devices to kill one another in 
   wars and yet they let their people suffer with abnormalities, 
   diseases, ignorance and hunger. I began to question if humanity, 
   having allowed all this to come about, was worth saving from itself. 
   I decided that I needed more information before I could make any decisions.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>At that time I couldn't get in touch with my 
   husband/owner and there was only one other person on Earth that I 
   knew to be an alien. And I trusted this Alien's opinion. I promptly 
   telephoned him for assistance in understanding this place. He did his 
   best to explain the culture, human social customs, and that I 
   couldn't go out and start a revolution to stop human suffering for it 
   seems that there has been entirely too much of that already.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>It took a good year for me to become humanized. My 
   husband and friend were very patient with my intolerance of 
   everything human. I still revolt occasionally just to keep them on 
   their toes, of course.</FONT>
