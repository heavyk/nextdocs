  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>This material is a follow-up from the material given out 
   last week entitled LOVE, although this portion was written months 
   before the other.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Please note that this portion is written mostly in the 
   FIRST RAY style of short, but often paradoxical maxims.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Also, we want to point out that this article has within 
   it the philosophy of the NEW AGE psychology, religion, science, 
   education and ethics. The choices are yours!</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The whole of the Universe is within you; just as surely 
   as you are within it.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>That which you do for yourself, as you are doing it, you 
   do it to every entity within the Universe and to the Universe itself.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>That which you do for others is being done to you as you 
   perform the act for others.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <FONT SIZE=4>A BRIEF RESTATEMENT</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>What you do for yourself is being done by you to all 
   others and conversely.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>What you do for others is being done back to you by all others.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>No one can perform an act affecting himself alone.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The WHOLE is a beautiful geometric pattern with each 
   point connected to all other points by so many rays that the whole 
   admits to no individuals.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>An individual is merely a point within ITS consciousness 
   that has been given a specialized task, or responsibility. Within 
   that points' responsibilities/ lives, he has autonomy of choices - 
   complete freedom! The WHOLE does not intrude to discipline or counsel 
   for there is no differentiation to it.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>The point may not be aware of the WHOLE, but the Whole 
   is very aware of all of itself.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Ones main responsibility is to see that you become the 
   BEST reflection of YOUR SELF which is the WHOLE.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>As a FREE living specialized unit of that ONE, our 
   choices should be carefully considered, for as such, what we choose 
   for ourselves, we have chosen for the WHOLE!</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>Such freedom brings awesome responsibility, for when I 
   make a choice or take an action, I have done it for and to everyone 
   in the Universe.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>To Rephrase: One is free to choose as he decides but in 
   his deciding, he decides for ALL!</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>For you are ALL, unknowingly. Thus, every individual 
   should be afforded their method of &quot;SELF REALIZATION&quot; for 
   what he IS, is also where he's going. The beginnings and the ends are 
   the same!</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>By now you probably have realized why we have given the 
   finding of YOURSELF such priority. An entity, upon meeting himself, 
   has found the WHOLE; the UNIVERSE; the ALL - that ONE!</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>A person, being a specialized extension or RAY of the 
   WHOLE has merely to follow himself back to that WHOLE. Therefore, you 
   are your path. You have already been where you are going!</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In seeking Self, you seek the WHOLE.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In finding SELF, you have found the Whole.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>In loving SELF, you love the whole.</FONT>
  </P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE=3>BUT, to KNOW SELF, IS TO BE.... a god.</FONT>
