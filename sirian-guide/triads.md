### ray roles

#### the female

the female receives energy from her reflection's ray, and then emit energy from her ray.

> FIRST and SEVENTH are ALPHA and OMEGA; two sides of the same thing; the serpent swallowing its tail. Naturally they work well together even though their personalities are vastly different. The SEVENTH RAY seeks the power of the FIRST in order to empower its forms. Or a SEVENTH RAY warrior working with a FIRST RAY female can wield energy as if he were a FIRST RAY

this means that the female, having the receptive polarity (-), seems also able to empower a male of the reflection with her energy. the most visible form of this is isis (2) and osiris (6). given what it says and other context clues, it appears isis empowered osiris to work with energy as if he were a second ray.

another context clue is that is says that (4, 5, 7) are all aspects of the 3rd ray, so this can fill in the gaps for the 3rd rays in the triads...

anatau (-1) receives energy from sanatau (+-3-+) in the form of (+7), of which one of the aspects of (3). really, she can receive energy from any 7th ray so she's compatible with the third and seventh ray triads as well which seems to be the point. this is the ALPHA and OMEGA. the document says that

isis (-2) will receive 2nd ray energy and output 6th ray energy. she is stepping down energy from jeortau (+2) from the first ray triad and giving it to osiris (+-6-+). additionally, osiris has can emit 2nd ray energy for her to receive as well.

unessa (-3) will receive energy from the 3rd ray and output 5th ray energy. she is stepping down energy from ra (+3) and from the second ray triad and giving it to saturn (+-4).

genxicat (-7) will receive energy from vulcan (-5+) in the form of (+3), of which one of its three aspects is (7).

#### the ground

the ground functions similar to the female. he takes in one energy and outputs another. the non-physical triad grounds, osiris (+-6-+) and sanatau (+-3-+), they have polarities on both sides of their number.

the tail polarity, I believe is the opposite layer of the midpoint reflection, so for osiris (+-6-+), he emits and receives on (6), but can also receive and emit on (2). the imagination/astral layer is taking input and converting it into concept/emotion, imagination, or physcal sensation. likewise, it's taking concept/emotion, mental images, or physical sensation and converting it into something resonant/relational.

when talking about osiris (+-6-+), it says that he would have had a difficult time if he were confined to to material reality, but being enclosed in matter from his own system (a canine race, red and white), he was fine. inotherwords, though he was a 6th ray receiver, he was still able to emit 2nd ray energies (for isis to receive)

saturn (+-4) looses his tail polarity. this is probably because it's redundant. the reflection of (4) is (4).

finally vulcan (-5+) gets a tail polarity again. he is receiving concepts (5), and outputting logic, structure and form (3). he's the reimplementation of sanatau (+-3-+). the 4th, 5th, and 7th rays are all aspects of the 3rd ray, so his output is compatible with both allayandra (+7) and genxicat (-7).

#### the emitter

I can't say that I fully understand the emitter, but, they seem to take in energy from their opposite and emit their ray.

jeortau (+2) will take in astral energy (6) and output (2) resonance, harmony, and a feeling of things working together.

thoth and allayandra (+7) both take in will/desire (1) and output order form and purpose in the form of a physical manifestation of that will desire (1).

ra (+3) takes in a concept or an abstract idea (5) and then produces a form, structure, or reality that can contain the idea. he's more like the path rather than the desire to walk it. he embodies "the right way", religion, or the instruction manual. just as thoth (+7) produces ceremony/ritual, order, processes, etc to produce a physical form or manifestation -- ra produces the ceremony/ritual, order or processes to produce a conceptul form or manifestation.

### first ray triad

- (-1) anatau / sekhmet
- (+2) jeortau / teonackaeeon / teonakaeean / (alalu)
- (+-3-+) sanatau / prahakatah / ptah / (enki)

### second ray triad

- (-2) isis
- (+3) ra
- (+-6-+) osiris

### third ray triad

- (-3) unessa / venus / (aphrodite)
- (+7) thoth
- (+-4) saturn / dwul quinn

### 7th ray triad

- (-7) genxicat
- (+7) allayandra / mars / aries
- (-5+) vulcan

### pairing and sets

#### opposite polarity

- (-1) anatau ?? (+1) allayandra
- (+2) jeortau || (-2) isis
- (-3) unessa >>|| (+-3-+) sanatau ||<< (+3) ra
- (+-4) saturn
- (-5+) vulcan
- (+-6-+) osiris
- (-7) genxicat ?| (+7) allayandra  |? (+7) thoth

notice that each ray type has both polarities, either in the same person or split between two people. the only one missing is +1 male which would be allayandra, which is nice because thoth already has the (+7) role, which means he's extra -- which also make it look like that's the goal for him.

#### reversals

- (-1) anatau, (+1) allayandra
  - (-5+) vulcan
- (+2) jeortau, (-2) isis
  - (+-6-+) osiris
- (-3) unessa, (+3) ra, (+-3-+) sanatau
  - (+7) thoth, (-7) genxicat, and (+7) allayandra
- (-2) isis
  - (+-4) saturn
- (+-4) saturn
  - (+-6-+) osiris

#### reflections

(sometimes I say "opposite ray type" -- when it's a reflection about the midpoint)

- (-1) anatau, (+1) allayandra
  - (-7) genxicat, (+7) thoth
- (-2) isis, (+2) jeortau
  - (+-4) saturn
- (-3) unessa, (+3) ra, (+-3-+) sanatau
  - (-5+) vulcan
- (+-6-+) osiris
  - (+-4) saturn

see [discussion in 7-layers-of-perception](/concepts/7-layers-of-perception.md#reversals-and-overview) for further discussion on why 4 is the reveral on 2 and 6

#### midpoints

- (+2) jeortau, (-2) isis
- (+-6-+) osiris
- (+-4) saturn

notice that each of the midpoints contain both polariities, either contained in the same person, or split between two people.

### family ties and a hidden 5th ray triad?

anatau and jeortau are twins. allayandra was also created with them, which gives me the impression that allayandra is going to be the reversal and opposite polarity of anatau. they are both mentioned as loving to war.

- (-1) anatau (twin)
- (+2) jeortau (twin)
- (+7) allayandra

> Being a SEVENTH RAY warrior, he also worked with Anatau. Within her energy domain, he could wield her energy as if he were a FIRST RAY male.

> Allayandra was created by the same triad that made Schekamet and Teonakaeean. There was much closeness and rapport between the three. Their minds were interconnected.

we see that his minds is interconnected with anatau and her twin jeortau. so, looking at the rays, when examining the 7th ray triad, things are strange because vulcan's polarity is swapped. he's a (-5+) which is basically the same setup as a female. he operates nearly the same...

to explain -- I believe the prefix polarity is the primary ray, and the postfix polarity is the reflection ray polarity. so, unlike any of the other rays, he receives 5th ray energy -- but from whom, right? and then he outputs the reflection (+3) energy. where is he getting his 5th ray energy?

in the section on the abstract mind, it's talking about the SOUL or SOLAR ANGEL, and it explains that this is the highest subplane of the MENTAL PLANE (5), and receives this information directly from the SECOND RAY of the MONAD. see @[sirian-guide/notes](the-monad-and-the-soul).

let's put the pieces together now: vulcrum the ground for genxicat, but his polarities have him as being receptive (like a female), but also as a (+3) emitter. I postulate that he's receiving his 5th ray energy from jeortau (+2), just like the solar angel gets energy gets energy from the monad and steps it down to be visible in the astral plane.

I also noticed that it says that allayandra (+7) when with anatau can wield energy like a first ray male, and that his mind is connected to jeotau and anatau which are twins.

- jeortau (+2)
- allayandra in form of 1st ray male (+-1-+) -- playing position as ground
- vulcan (in male form) is receiver of jeortau emitter of 5th ray (-3,+5), but with the '-' prefix, means he receives 5th in addition to 3rd ray energy, much like a 5th ray female (-5) receives and emits 5th ray energy.

so that forces anatau to be the stability for the triad, meaning she will now emit like a male, the opposite ray (+7). this fits nicely with the 7th ray triad, as that's what genxicat is looking for.

it's essentially the return of the 1st ray triad, but with the opposite polarity. instead of being seen the first ray (desire/will) perspective, it's now seen from the seventh ray implementation perspective.

### 5th ray triad as catalyst

- vulcan (-5+)
- allayandra + anatau (+-1-+)
- genxicat v2.0 (-7+)

I don't really know how to present this concept, so I'll just go for it....

first, it's important to notice that vulcan has polarity issues because vulcan is emitting and receiving their ray type (5th), which makes them energetically similar to a female but with the added bonus of being able to receive 3rd ray energy as well (but not emit it). vulcan is the female here, which is why I've chosen the name "5th ray triad"

allayandra plays the ground, but an interesting thing to note is that he's emitting and receiving 1st ray energy, which is his opposite ray type (he's 7th ray male, which usually receives 1st ray and emits 7th). the fact that he's also emitting his ray type makes him similar also to a female or to the ground.

so if both of them are emitting and receiving their opposite ray type, then that means that there is a missing part, in the placement of genxicat. she is a 7th ray female receiving and emitting 7th ray energy, however if the ground is allayandra as a 1st ray in opposite fashion, he's looking for other 7th ray females in opposite polarity (-7+).

to understand this, we'll look at the triad relationships. the female is the attractor or the goal frequency. the ground provides stablity to get there and also kind of a bridge, and the emitter is kind of like the present state of mind of the leading thinkers in society: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 7. once you hit 7th, that's the most physical you can get and you're as far away (most materialistic/mechanistic) form of perception, the furthest away from the big picture (2) and desire (1).

therefore, it's obvious to me that the next female will be 1st ray, which is like the first ray triad, but we have to get there. the reason why I think this is the catalyst triad to a number of new 1st ray triads is because it's happening in reverse. also looking at the previous triads, they each involved a midpoint cept the last one: 2 -> 6 -> 4 -> (7?) and these defined radical changes in human perception at least amongst the leadership (probably analogous to the "root races"). this last phase began the age of the individual, so it's for this reason that I believe that the 7th is the new "midpoint" (inflection point) which allows the new "leadership" to become individual.

this hidden 5th ray triad is the 7th ray triad but perceived from an opposite perspective, and so therfore it becomes the a precursor to the new opposite polarity 1st ray triads.

perhaps one way to look at it would be to look at it like this. previously there are three aspects (I'll use 2nd ray triad as an example):

1st ray triad (8 aspects):

- anatau (female): -1, +1
- sanatau (ground): -3, -5, +3, +5
- jeortau (emitter): -6, +2

2nd ray triad (8 aspects):

- isis (female): -2, +2
- osiris (ground): -2, -6, +2, +6
- ra (emitter): -5, +3

3rd ray triad (6 aspects?):

- unessa (female): -3, +3
- thoth (emitter): -1, +7
- saturn (ground): -4, +4, (+-2?), (+-6?)

7th ray triad (7 aspects):

- genxicat (female): -7, +7
- vulcan (ground): -3, -5, +5
- allayandra (emitter): -1, +7

5th ray triad (9 aspects):

- vulcan (female): -3, -5, +5
- allayandra (ground?): -1, +1, +7
- genxicat (emitter?): -1, -7, +7

it's hard for me to conceptualise this, going by such little data, but they said that allayandra (-1, +7) adds in anatau (-1, +1), so that gives three components (-1, +1, +7), meaning that allyandra is very similar now to the 7th ray triad of vulcan but of 1,7 rather than 3,5. vulcan (-3, +5) in that triad is looks to have absorbed a 5th ray female (of which they don't mention), but I do wonder if he absorbed unessa (-3, +3) which would result (-3, +3, +5), but this is exactly the opposite of vulcan (-3, -5, +6), and so I wonder if this has to do with the physical body. what I mean is that if you were to put a female "soul" into a male body, what would result? likewise, what if you were to put a male "soul" into a female body? this is where I get this idea of gender swaps.

the other thing I want to note is that each of the people in the 5th ray triad have three aspects to them, which is different from the other triads. therefore, it's my belief that the females in this triad will be something more like a masculine "soul" in a female body. I have no idea for notation on this, so perhaps (+7-) which translates into (+7, -7, -1). good enough for me.

I have to quit here, as beyond this point, it'll sound like speculation, so I'll just summarise that speculation succinctly: which is that I believe there's a reason why pluto (4) is in the same system with charon (2), coming originally from tiamat, which is also the same polarity as our moon is here, because these will become the future males. I believe our sun is a 2nd ray female, so if these 7th ray females are getting transformed into 1st ray females, these become the new stars... so the next iteration will feature a triad of interconnected minds, not of 1-2-7 but of 7-6-1 (something like that. many holes still exist in my understanding, like I don't see the 6-2-4 of the moon, charon, and pluto connection quite yet -- but I'm still working on it) like I said, speculation.

### thinking out loud

I haven't really thought about it, but this may also be able to be applied to the 3rd ray triad as well. lemme try...

- (-3) unessa / venus / (aphrodite)
- (+7) thoth / (zeus)
- (+-4) saturn / dwul quinn

so, let's take saturn and put him into female form. that means that osiris if paired with him could use 4th ray energy as if he were a (+4).

---

further thinking on this after sleeping reminds me that there are other pretty apparent clues they left:
- mars loved venus (-3)
- we're in a second ray (solar) system (-2)
- the sun (-2) in the tychos model is in two triad relationships:
  - venus/lucifer, mercury
  - mars, earth
- it mentions the earth as going through its "third initiation"

the third initiation combines the 3rd ray aspect energy with the 2nd ray to bring down the fire of the 1st ray. that is the "hidden" triad that I analysed in the previous section.

so let's look at the triads now:

the sun (-2) being a female will allow the proper male the capabilities to function as a male version of her. so, for example allayandra is a (+7), but around anatau, he can be a (+1). that means we're looking for now a (+6) male, which in her energy can be a (+2).

the only (+6) male they mention is osiris.

going back to the sun, let's figure out the grounds...

- sun (-2)
- mercury/thoth (+7)
- (-7,+2)

if we turn mars into a ground, then that forces unessa (-3) to become a ...

the idea here is that just like the other hidden triad is to make stability so there can be many 7th ray females, this triad is to make stability so there can be many 7th ray males (in the form of grounds).

- sun (-2)
- mars (-7,+1)
- unessa as male (+3) ???? - needs more thinking...

### polarity changes
