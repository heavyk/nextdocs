#### corrupted 7th ray

influences primary triads and introduces dissention.
stakes out the astral plane as his domain
working on the atral plane, he believed his own propaganda (inotherwords, "when I see it, I belive it")

one intersting thing to note is that this 7th ray decideds that he is supreme ruler of the lowest plane, the astral plane; it's almost as if he decides he's going to make the next universe from the bottom-up.

I see eye-to-eye with him on this aspect. I really dislike the form of creation that is described here. it really feels like a load of effort. if, in fact the 7th day/ray is supposed to be the day/ray of rest, then why is this creation process so much work!!

#### the way I see it

I've learned that really almost no effort needs to be made to create anything. it's already all created, and all you have to do is to tune into it. I could just imagine source watching these guys working so hard to create their new universe, with so much effort and all of that and their universe is a very very crippled version of the not-yet-manifested (source-version) of the universe.. and they're like... you know, when you know what you don't want, you automatically create what you do want.

they got the part about building up enough energy right but then completely missed the mark on tuning into what they wanted. they tried to accomplish what's wanted with magnificent amounts of effort, when it was already created.

they had such massive egos believing that their imaginary version of what the universe should be like, was perceived as superior to the source version of it -- which subsequently manifested their astral superiority complex into a tangible corrupted 7th ray (astral plane at the time) problem.

the 7th ray is the most tangible manifestation of the 1st ray, so it's no wonder that this 7th ray conformed to the desire of the first ray... it was only natural for him. he was accomplishing that desire -- in the form of unwanted -- but, because wanted-and-unwanted-are-same, it was eventually realised that earth and that creating by tuning was actually the wanted aspect to to their creation (the-problem-is-the-solution) -- the 7th day/ray of rest.

### creation of the physical plane

our galaxy was created with a physical plane (inotherwords, our galaxy is the only one with a physical plane).

many volunteers begin to inhabit regions of the galaxy and evolve their method of reproducing and living in a galaxy where death is now possible.

they created s/t and tech civs. the tech civs focused their energy into creating physical devices that could do things (tech civs were the origin of materiality), meanwhile the s/t civs used their spiritual wisdom to create technology justly and according to the laws (the s/t civs were the origin of the "laws").

---

previously, the infected astral entities inhabited bodies that lasted forever, so their numbers kept growing, as they were constantly able to infect a percentage of the other astral entities (which also lived forever). this galaxy had slightly lower vibration entites they thought they could influence. they, came to this galaxy to "rule from above" (top-down influencing -- just like the elders this universe, of which one was the corrupted 7th ray).

on the physical plane, they attempted to influence the physical entities from their (still immortal) astral bodies. the s/t civs were able to see them and weren't influenced by them. the tech civs were not developed enough to actually see them, so the were able to secretly influence the tech civs without being detected.

the tech civs unfortunately had a lot of agreements in place between them that needed to be eroded, because they knew that war = destruction and they didn't want to destroy each other's stuff, and so the INFECTED ONES tried to influence from the astral, but tradition was too hard to overcome.

they decided to avoid the creators who were acting like cosmic policemen and incarnate into bodies, being born into influential families and garner influential and powerful positions in the tech civs.

little by little they altered these tech civs' tradition and laws (origin strictly adhering to tradition), and little by little they gained more power and influence.

they introduced:
- nationalism (faction pride)
- elements of doubt, distrust, and uncertainty of neighbouring civs word/agreement
- defense weapons to ensure the faction's sovereignty (what if they attack instead of trade)

the wars started and everyone destroyed everyone until there were only two tech civs left on opposite ends of the galaxy. stalemate.

---

the cosmic policemen pursued the perps into physical by going to the star systems of the s/t civs looking for sufficiently capable bodies that could handle their energy.
