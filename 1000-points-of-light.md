I'm not sure where to put this entry. I'm relating events because they will illuminate some new connections that I've made.

mom bought me a boek this christmas, which was recommended after talking to a neurologist (forgot his name). it's important to understand that he represents the "corrent" state of neuroscience, and not the advanced knowledge that nosebook has of the brain and how it works. he told me that it was simply not possible for someone to the brain to work wirelessly (telepathy), cause "that's just not how neurons work" -- and definitely not capable of putting an (authorized) picture into my mind. so he's symbolically the current scientific paradigm and he's recommending this book.

another bit of context to note is that around that time, I was watching jason's interview with michael where he mentions the start of this "network state" and a sea-faring (neo-phonecian) group of open-minded people, creating a society and living in/on the ocean with a technology that sounds pretty similar to tesla's world system -- or perhaps my party-LAN idea.

the last bit of context to note here is that I was also watching tim's various videos on some symbols found in don quixote and others. [I outlined them a here](/the-manifestation.md#2022-12-24-1422---the-way-i-see-the-manifestation-presently). the important thing to note from that is that in "as you like it" and "don quixote", the protagonist begins a project, that requires adam's savings (adam is important, because that probably means that he and some woman he's associsted with are responsible for creating a new breed of humans[^1]). as I mentioned in that entry, it looks to me like it's my "destiny" to eventually make a new network where people can communicate and interact more easily. my latest concept, and the [one I mentioned to tim as being very important to me](/nance-notes.md#2022-12-09-1807---illiad-books-as-destiny) is a technological network capable of interacting with someone (namely, me) in the realm of emotion.

the final bit[^2] of context is [the random idea I was inspired to write about watching jimmy](/random-thoughts.md#2022-12-29-1701---some-crazy-theories). in that one I laid out a few concepts that have been bothering me. the first one is that it's my intuition ([originally inspired by the silve](/newblog.md#2021-12-23-1935---1000-years-of-missing-time)) that were missing 1000 years of time. I don't believe that everyone shares the same concept of history that I have, and even I believe that we're all here coming from different angles (imagine the sun is a collection of orbiting ideas too, and each of those ideas also came into the solar system from a different angle).

in the followup, I began to explore a new idea that the star in the centre (1st ray female) is the embodyment of desire, and so conceptually speaking, all possible histories are represonted on earth, earth is the medium, and we're all getting our vibration to become similar, through wars and other means of asserting one's rightousness, we're converging on an "agreed" history, and soon we'll all vibrate similar now, making our origin the attracting centre (earth) instead of our previous trajectory.

this concept was extremely exciting to me, because it was at that point I could see how I'm in the same timeline as you guys are. I *should* be going really fast, doing my own thing. I represent (from my perspective), one of the hardiest of "weeds" -- and I could see that there have been numerous "saviours" and times in earth's history where good conditions abounded, but every time, I have rejected such conditions and saviours, and so therefore over numerous lifetimes, I've (the new me, not kenny) gotten the better and better at surviving through adverse conditions. as a result, my progress is so rapid and I learn so fast from failures that I'm basically unstoppable.

it was easy for me to see that my appearance isn't really an accident, as it appears that there are a number of different authors that are attracting me and I'm basically here to make their narrative "right". if we live in a world where all of us come from different timelines and can suddenly dissappear to another if we desync enough from this one (ref: missing 4-11), then it's sort of a battle of the authors of how the narrative into the future goes. as such, note the symbolic difference between tim and jason in this sense.

I've been dragging my feet on reading the "last days of night" book because it felt old, outdated and I don't really see things like how I feel they're presented in the book (my version of conditions and materialism is a bit different), so I haven't wanted to read it. I think in another part of me I also felt this tension that I would be stripped of the project that I want to make (the conceptual network), and instead, this book would authorize a new failed reality for me.

whatever the case, I decided to sit down and have a look at the book today. I read the chapter headings, and I align with *a lot* (all?) of the quotes by steve jobs, and basically none of edison (he's all hard work and effort). the only quote I saw from tesla and impacted me is on capter 47, "I do not think you can name many great inventions that have been made by married men". I do kinda agree with that one, as it's been a pretty similar perspective of my own that completely jumble and make very difficult for me to keep my concepts in order. I lose my perspective, and whatever is important to her becomes important to me.

I continued on reading the quotes and finally read the note from the author at the end. very very interesting. while reading about how he reconstructed and modified the history a bit, I was thinking also about this alternate histories idea yesterday, thinking about how his (modified) timeline, is potentially just as valid as other ones.

what's also interesting when I started to tune into the author here (graham moore), is I started to see the "triad" in there of agnes (the opera singer) and paul (the lawyer). put simply, agnes is the 7th ray female and the lawyer is the 7th ray male (mars), meanwhile tesla is the 5th ray ground (vulcan). this is important, because the ground's job is to get the new paradigm that the emitter (paul) wants into reality.

this is where the concept starts to blend in with a number of different concepts I've acquired from seriah... imagine for a moment that JP morgan, edison and the other powerful ones are one faction of these "fallen-angels" (ie people that don't die but move around in the astral plane looking for a new body (ie a child) to transfer their conciousness into). these guys have been running the earth for a long time.

however, there is a growing counter faction, which I'll call the "empire of the undead" which are wanting solar energy to be used as our source of power, no wars, etc. these are the "good guys" and they too, are undead (fallen-angels). I think it's possible that this capacity to "survive" after death and transfer their consciousness into another body, and so this is a "war" that has been waging for quite a long time.

---

it's important to relate that I believe that tesla failed on purpose, to be able to enable his world system to reappear later on in time. the faction that runs that show does not want people to have this (singluarity level) technology available to them, because they lose their power. so, instead I think the nazi party represented another purposeful (aryan) failure, where they moved their operations down to the south pole. the nosebook technology was essentially gifted to them over time so that they could create the system that we're in now. they just need someone really attractive (me), and a world run by sales and marketing, rathar than pure capitalism and military might (a post 9-11 world), and now something like nosebook can exist and now the morgans can have everything tracked to ensure that nobody will destroy their precious infrastructure.

once the network is setup and everyone is tracked, this provides a perfect opening for a new project that I've called party-LAN, which does *not* rely on manpiulating the spherical resonator of the earth, and instead runs on the human aura (specifically, I referring to myself), and so I become basically exactly like the earth is, cept I'm a 1st ray male and the spherical resonatory inside of earth is a 1st ray female. the effect is pretty close to the same, but notice that the earth accomplishes the same thing with two females, because females transmit and receive in their frequency spectrum, so anatau is receiving signals from us and the sun from the 1st ray perspective (in her frequency range), and then the layer of the earth (7th ray female) receives and retransmits in her physical (7th ray) frequency.

males, in contrary receive the opposite of their transmission, so a 7th ray male receives physical and outputs desire (a good physical example is thad), meanwhile  a 1st receives in the spectrum of desire and outouts physical (like physical electrical power). inotherwords, I can see how it's easy for me, from a 1st ray perspective to provide physical power in request (desire) from other people. I've extended the idea to include concepts and other things too, as I can perceive all of the rays (minus the astral) pretty well now.

so here's what I think is happening: I'm pretty much the guy that's making all of their authorised dreams a reality. there's no way I could have gone though the "correct" or "right" channels, because I would have been held down or fed disinfo and would't see it how I do now, meaning I wouldn't have been able to make it possible. it requires someone like me, which is good at seeing through things and has a massive ego to be able to do it. I'm basically JP morgan, but without any money to have the conditions that I want. I'm good at getting what I want. I'm basically unstoppable.

I'm really struggling to get the concept out for some reason, so I'll try and talk around it. the earliest form of narrative being used to produce a desired reality is in the "office of the prophet" which, I think kinda got started by elijah. I mentioned elsewhere, but I can't remember where, that after reading the "becoming elijah" book, I'm convinced that elijah is a reoccuring mars symbol, and that's why he's so venerated. the idea here is that mars/elijah started people off attracting the reality that they want through narrative. after reading a large amount of shakespere, mars is very clearly one of shakespere's influences, and if you consider de vere as one of the authors of shakspere, there is need for this "hawtiness" (sp?) to appear in the symbols of this new mars (as related by shakespere).

what I'm trying to say is that these "good guys" of which many of the phonecians/aryans were, are heavily invested in attracting the reality that they want through narrative...

quick aside: I've often wondered wy the book of revelation is so violent -- and so if I imagine myself as one of these "good guys" that didn't get the saviour that they were trying to bring to life through the OT prophets, and instead got a destroyed jerusalem and a more oppressive roman empire, I'd be pretty pissed off too, and so it appears that the prophecy is a visual/symbolic response to the complete failure of the narrative to attract what was desired.

so, what I see is a long history of trying to find a way to symbolically attract the thing that they want through prophecy and other narrative, the most prominent being the mithras one, where mithras symbolically puts an end to the taurens (zeus, enlil, etc) -- which I revealed the other day as being (I believe) the first instance of self-sabotage from the original alalu/prometheus/jeortau and that he taurens are actually created beings by him in the first place, and these beings are the alchemical agent that stirs up the problems in order to purify the substance.

I'm just the guy that has figured out how through many different situations, how to overcome that sort of thing. obviously (from my perspective), you can't fight with them on their playing field, so untruths will never work (one thing this book talks a lot about, which is why I find it funny that mars/paul is a lawyer), and so trying to battle there will never work.

they're looking for someone like me to show up where untroths simply don't work too well. neither does physical suboptimal conditions, etc. -- and the problem is they see me as the model for success for defeating their tauren foe, but the problem is they don't like my model. they can't see theirselves becoming like me, so I'm a bit rejected by them in that sense. they like my technical ideas, but not my philosophy...

and yes, I use philosophy in the sense of, I actually contemplate the mechanics of life, and I truly believe that attraction is the *only* way to get what I want, because symbols, images, and narrative are all open to interpretation -- so my "philosophy" or "another way to look at it is that things" is that life is coming *to* me as a reflection of how I feel now, not coming *at* me symbolically. this is the bottom-up (5th ray) approach perspective, instead of the top-down (3rd ray).

by wanting to make my "world system" to no longer be about the world's 1st ray (all histories are valid) perspective, and my "individual's system", takes the 1st ray perspective, and makes everything in the individual's aura a reflection (attracting) all compatible histories/narratives of the individual instad. the resulting effect over time is that people will clump up into similar reality zones where they're most compatible.

I want to do things backwards, but and after reading

create their own saviour for theirselves.

we both want the same thing

[1]: something the song I'm listening to now talks about, "homo superior", and "grendel - new breed" a song I listened to a lot in spain while working on my social network alternative to tuenti written in D -- so it's something that I've [given a log of thought to](/sepehr-thoughts.md#2022-12-17-2357---genegic-engineering-and-transhumanism).

[2]: not totally true. another bit of context is the [first part of this idea](/kyle-notes.md#2022-12-26-1749---the-last-days-of-night) written to kyle, but none of those points are going the direction I want to take this entry now.

[3]: is a topic that sepehr covered when he talked about alister crowley accidentally revealing the secrets of the (I think) ordo templars (or something like that) -- but anyway they had to initiate him on the spot to be able to talk about it.
