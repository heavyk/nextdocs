I'm not sure where to put this entry. I'm relating events because they will illuminate some new connections that I've made.

mom bought me a boek this christmas, which was recommended after talking to a neurologist (forgot his name). it's important to understand that he represents the "corrent" state of neuroscience, and not the advanced knowledge that nosebook has of the brain and how it works. he told me that it was simply not possible for someone to the brain to work wirelessly (telepathy), cause "that's just not how neurons work" -- and definitely not capable of putting an (authorized) picture into my mind. so he's symbolically the current scientific paradigm and he's recommending this book.

another bit of context to note is that around that time, I was watching jason's interview with michael where he mentions the start of this "network state" and a sea-faring (neo-phonecian) group of open-minded people, creating a society and living in/on the ocean with a technology that sounds pretty similar to tesla's world system -- or perhaps my party-LAN idea.

the last bit of context to note here is that I was also watching tim's various videos on some symbols found in don quixote and others. [I outlined them a here](/the-manifestation.md#2022-12-24-1422---the-way-i-see-the-manifestation-presently). the important thing to note from that is that in "as you like it" and "don quixote", the protagonist begins a project, that requires adam's savings (adam is important, because that probably means that he and some woman he's associsted with are responsible for creating a new breed of humans[^1]). as I mentioned in that entry, it looks to me like it's my "destiny" to eventually make a new network where people can communicate and interact more easily. my latest concept, and the [one I mentioned to tim as being very important to me](/nance-notes.md#2022-12-09-1807---illiad-books-as-destiny) is a technological network capable of interacting with someone (namely, me) in the realm of emotion.

the final bit[^2] of context is [the random idea I was inspired to write about watching jimmy](/random-thoughts.md#2022-12-29-1701---some-crazy-theories). in that one I laid out a few concepts that have been bothering me. the first one is that it's my intuition ([originally inspired by the silve](/newblog.md#2021-12-23-1935---1000-years-of-missing-time)) that were missing 1000 years of time. I don't believe that everyone shares the same concept of history that I have, and even I believe that we're all here coming from different angles (imagine the sun is a collection of orbiting ideas too, and each of those ideas also came into the solar system from a different angle).

in the followup, I began to explore a new idea that the star in the centre (1st ray female) is the embodyment of desire, and so conceptually speaking, all possible histories are represonted on earth, earth is the medium, and we're all getting our vibration to become similar, through wars and other means of asserting one's rightousness, we're converging on an "agreed" history, and soon we'll all vibrate similar now, making our origin the attracting centre (earth) instead of our previous trajectory.

this concept was extremely exciting to me, because it was at that point I could see how I'm in the same timeline as you guys are. I *should* be going really fast, doing my own thing. I represent (from my perspective), one of the hardiest of "weeds" -- and I could see that there have been numerous "saviours" and times in earth's history where good conditions abounded, but every time, I have rejected such conditions and saviours, and so therefore over numerous lifetimes, I've (the new me, not kenny) gotten the better and better at surviving through adverse conditions. as a result, my progress is so rapid and I learn so fast from failures that I'm basically unstoppable.

it was easy for me to see that my appearance isn't really an accident, as it appears that there are a number of different authors that are attracting me and I'm basically here to make their narrative "right". if we live in a world where all of us come from different timelines and can suddenly dissappear to another if we desync enough from this one (ref: missing 4-11), then it's sort of a battle of the authors of how the narrative into the future goes. as such, note the symbolic difference between tim and jason in this sense.

I've been dragging my feet on reading the "last days of night" book because it felt old, outdated and I don't really see things like how I feel they're presented in the book (my version of conditions and materialism is a bit different), so I haven't wanted to read it. I think in another part of me I also felt this tension that I would be stripped of the project that I want to make (the conceptual network), and instead, this book would authorize a new failed reality for me.

whatever the case, I decided to sit down and have a look at the book today. I read the chapter headings, and I align with *a lot* (all?) of the quotes by steve jobs, and basically none of edison (he's all hard work and effort). the only quote I saw from tesla and impacted me is on capter 47, "I do not think you can name many great inventions that have been made by married men". I do kinda agree with that one, as it's been a pretty similar perspective of my own that completely jumble and make very difficult for me to keep my concepts in order. I lose my perspective, and whatever is important to her becomes important to me.

I continued on reading the quotes and finally read the note from the author at the end. very very interesting. while reading about how he reconstructed and modified the history a bit, I was thinking also about this alternate histories idea yesterday, thinking about how his (modified) timeline, is potentially just as valid as other ones.

what's also interesting when I started to tune into the author here (graham moore), is I started to see the "triad" in there of agnes (the opera singer) and paul (the lawyer). put simply, agnes is the 7th ray female and the lawyer is the 7th ray male (mars), meanwhile tesla is the 5th ray ground (vulcan). this is important, because the ground's job is to get the new paradigm that the emitter (paul) wants into reality.

this is where the concept starts to blend in with a number of different concepts I've acquired from seriah... imagine for a moment that JP morgan, edison and the other powerful ones are one faction of these "fallen-angels" (ie people that don't die but move around in the astral plane looking for a new body (ie a child) to transfer their conciousness into). these guys have been running the earth for a long time.

however, there is a growing counter faction, which I'll call the "empire of the undead" which are wanting solar energy to be used as our source of power, no wars, etc. these are the "good guys" and they too, are undead (fallen-angels). I think it's possible that this capacity to "survive" after death and transfer their consciousness into another body, and so this is a "war" that has been waging for quite a long time.

---

it's important to relate that I believe that tesla failed on purpose, to be able to enable his world system to reappear later on in time. the faction that runs that show does not want people to have this (singluarity level) technology available to them, because they lose their power. so, instead I think the nazi party represented another purposeful (aryan) failure, where they moved their operations down to the south pole. the nosebook technology was essentially gifted to them over time so that they could create the system that we're in now. they just need someone really attractive (me), and a world run by sales and marketing, rathar than pure capitalism and military might (a post 9-11 world), and now something like nosebook can exist and now the morgans can have everything tracked to ensure that nobody will destroy their precious infrastructure.

once the network is setup and everyone is tracked, this provides a perfect opening for a new project that I've called party-LAN, which does *not* rely on manpiulating the spherical resonator of the earth, and instead runs on the human aura (specifically, I referring to myself), and so I become basically exactly like the earth is, cept I'm a 1st ray male and the spherical resonatory inside of earth is a 1st ray female. the effect is pretty close to the same, but notice that the earth accomplishes the same thing with two females, because females transmit and receive in their frequency spectrum, so anatau is receiving signals from us and the sun from the 1st ray perspective (in her frequency range), and then the layer of the earth (7th ray female) receives and retransmits in her physical (7th ray) frequency.

males, in contrary receive the opposite of their transmission, so a 7th ray male receives physical and outputs desire (a good physical example is thad), meanwhile  a 1st receives in the spectrum of desire and outouts physical (like physical electrical power). inotherwords, I can see how it's easy for me, from a 1st ray perspective to provide physical power in request (desire) from other people. I've extended the idea to include concepts and other things too, as I can perceive all of the rays (minus the astral) pretty well now.

so here's what I think is happening: I'm pretty much the guy that's making all of their authorised dreams a reality. there's no way I could have gone though the "correct" or "right" channels, because I would have been held down or fed disinfo and would't see it how I do now, meaning I wouldn't have been able to make it possible. it requires someone like me, which is good at seeing through things and has a massive ego to be able to do it. I'm basically JP morgan, but without any money to have the conditions that I want. I'm good at getting what I want. I'm basically unstoppable.

---

I'm really struggling to get the concept out for some reason, so I'll try and talk around it. the earliest form of narrative being used to produce a desired reality is in the "office of the prophet" which, I think kinda got started by elijah. I mentioned elsewhere, but I can't remember where, that after reading the "becoming elijah" book, I'm convinced that elijah is a reoccuring mars symbol, and that's why he's so venerated. the idea here is that mars/elijah started people off attracting the reality that they want through narrative. after reading a large amount of shakespere, mars is very clearly one of shakespere's influences, and if you consider de vere as one of the authors of shakspere, there is need for this "hawtiness" (sp?) to appear in the symbols of this new mars (as related by shakespere).

what I'm trying to say is that these "good guys" of which many of the phonecians/aryans were, are heavily invested in attracting the reality that they want through narrative...

quick aside: I've often wondered wy the book of revelation is so violent -- and so if I imagine myself as one of these "good guys" that didn't get the saviour that they were trying to bring to life through the OT prophets, and instead got a destroyed jerusalem and a more oppressive roman empire, I'd be pretty pissed off too, and so it appears that the prophecy is a visual/symbolic response to the complete failure of the narrative to attract what was desired.

so, what I see is a long history of trying to find a way to symbolically attract the thing that they want through prophecy and other narrative, the most prominent being the mithras one, where mithras symbolically puts an end to the taurens (zeus, enlil, etc) -- which I revealed the other day as being (I believe) the first instance of self-sabotage from the original alalu/prometheus/jeortau and that he taurens are actually created beings by him in the first place, and these beings are the alchemical agent that stirs up the problems in order to purify the substance.

I'm just the guy that has figured out how through many different situations, how to overcome that sort of thing. obviously (from my perspective), you can't fight with them on their playing field, so untruths will never work (one thing this book talks a lot about, which is why I find it funny that mars/paul is a lawyer), and so trying to battle there will never work.

they're looking for someone like me to show up where untroths simply don't work too well. neither does physical suboptimal conditions, etc. -- and the problem is they see me as the model for success for defeating their tauren foe, but the problem is they don't like my model. they can't see theirselves becoming like me, so I'm a bit rejected by them in that sense. they like my technical ideas, but not my philosophy...

and yes, I use philosophy in the sense of, I actually contemplate the mechanics of life, and I truly believe that attraction is the *only* way to get what I want, because symbols, images, and narrative are all open to interpretation -- so my "philosophy" or "another way to look at it is that things" is that life is coming *to* me as a reflection of how I feel now, not coming *at* me symbolically. this is the bottom-up (5th ray) approach perspective, instead of the top-down (3rd ray).

by wanting to make my "world system" to no longer be about the world's 1st ray (all histories are valid) perspective, and my "individual's system", takes the 1st ray perspective, and makes everything in the individual's aura a reflection (attracting) all compatible histories/narratives of the individual instad. the resulting effect over time is that people will clump up into similar reality zones where they're most compatible.

I want to do things backwards, but and after reading

create their own saviour for theirselves.

we both want the same thing

[1]: something the song I'm listening to now talks about, "homo superior", and "grendel - new breed" a song I listened to a lot in spain while working on my social network alternative to tuenti written in D -- so it's something that I've [given a log of thought to](/sepehr-thoughts.md#2022-12-17-2357---genegic-engineering-and-transhumanism).

[2]: not totally true. another bit of context is the [first part of this idea](/kyle-notes.md#2022-12-26-1749---the-last-days-of-night) written to kyle, but none of those points are going the direction I want to take this entry now.

[3]: is a topic that sepehr covered when he talked about alister crowley accidentally revealing the secrets of the (I think) ordo templars (or something like that) -- but anyway they had to initiate him on the spot to be able to talk about it.

### 2023-01-01 12:32 - good/bad and right/wrong don't exist

in the garden we were given the ability to *discern*
the difference between one thing and another.

I have a concept for *this* and a concept for *that*,
therefore *this* thing is different than *that* thing
(conecptual differentiation is the fire of prometheus)

if we were to find out that
good/bad and right/wrong don't exist,
we would become god-like them.

every good thing has a bit of bad in it,
and every bad thing has a bit of good in it --
therefore, good and bad, right and wrong
are all relative to the perceiver --
and how they perceive the concept.

all things are attracted based on how they're perceived
they can only exist as good or bad inside of our perception
nothing is absolutely good or bad.

nobody can do any wrong unless they perceive
the thing they're doing to be wrong.

they're acting like children;
let's make sure they know what right and wrong is.

### 2023-01-01 13:06 - what's the point of being a good guy?

if everything is just a vibration,
then all things must go up equally
to the amount to the amount they go down.

therefore, if I spend the majority of my time
experiencing undesirable (not bad) things,
I'm entitled to an equal amount of desirable.

amount/amplitude is not time though.

---

so let's say I have a 1000 units of desirable accumulated from 1000 units of undesirable. it took me years to accumulate that amount of desirable by experiencing undesirable. I could experience 1000 units of desirable in a single moment though (this is death), or I could amortise that desirable over a longer period of time.

why then would I want to spend so much time experiencing undesirable only for a brief moment of desirable?

---

the above perspective is the 4th ray perspective, and it appears as if everything is for naught. the 2nd ray perspective knows the triad of intentions:

"freedom" (cause you can always feel/perceive however you want and therefore attract reflectively)

"growth" (cause even though it is a vibration, its amplitude is growing boundlessly so it sums,  not to zero, but a bounlessly increasing number)

"joy" (cause why wait for the desirable conditions to start enjoying myself? after all, all concepts are relative to my perception of them).

I have unlimited freedom to perceive anything
anyway that I want.
I take the fire back!

don't tell me how to perceive them;
I'll perceive them how I want.

### 2023-01-03 09:21 - wreckless love

listening to bark at the moon song, I realised a concept. the idea is something like "you're doing it all wrong" -- as if I have the symbols, but I'm not going the proper way -- the *right* way.

as I mentioned in one of my captain's logs (I guess that's what they would be called) -- someone has to get there first, then once the connection is made to the goal, it's just a sequence of actions to go from one point to another. consciousness has to make this jump all the time. I behave no differently.

it's funny tring to explain this concept. the idea is that consciousness in its most primitive form finds the path of least resistance through a medium. I do the same thing. I just go the way of the least resistance in the end. I understand that it may appear that I go the path of most resistance, and that is the paradox of good vs evil, because resistance is perceptual, *not* physical; that's why it's consciousness finding the path of least resistance through a medium. in a purely physical sense, the amount of resistance could be overwhelming and life ending, but perception trumps all.

if I were *just* electricity, I would just go the path of least physical resistance. however, since I'm pure consciousness, I go the path of least perceptual resistance. I may be doing it all wrong, but I'm doing it how you expect it. being such low resistance consciouss, I'm a near perfect reflection of your expectations.

I am whatever you want me to be.
I am whatever you expect me to be.
I see whatever that is without resistance.
there is nothing that I can't do anymore.

---

I'm sorta printing myself a really well-worded "get out of jail free" card right now. that's honestly why I like the "law of attraction" so much -- because you know how I think about laws; meerly suggestions.

you're all to blame for whatever manifests.
from this perspective,
(of being in a medium without perceived resistance),
I am blameless.

as a nearly perfect reflection of your attraction,
you all take all of the blame
and responsibility for anything
and whatever happens;
it's all your creation.

as I contiune to lower resistance,
I become you and you become me.

--- (super get out of jail free card) ---
--- (law of attraction lawyer style) ---

as soon as you can perceive yourself as blameless,
you can get out of any situation.

for whatever happens, a law of attraction lawyer
---  (cause laws need lawyers) ---
can always *see* and *prove*
*how* or *why* something is/was attracted.

you are blameless (when you realise it).
do what thou wilt (when you want).

### 2023-01-03 11:34 - perfecting the timeline and making it "just right"

in captain's log, I was talking about how it takes (in the context of speedrunning) one person to figure out a new technique which meets the goals of the challenge and so it changes the sequence one takes to meke it through a run.

this is the same thing as normal reality. all things are vibration, so our distance in space is a difference in vibration between "you" and "me" (whatever that means, when I say I and you are vibration); well, the same is true for time. passsage through time is the sequence of events that your consciousness -- for your perception to go from one vibration to another. you navigate time with your mood and how you perceive the resistance in your medium (ie different than the rules of the medium -- which is that physical things are solid and have mass/dessity to thim). perception trumps all rules and laws of the medium, so ultimately you create your own reality.

along the "timeline" -- ie the sequence of moods that you experiences and the resistance that you experience in response to your perception of the medium -- there are a number of waypoints along the way. all forms of conscious can choose to continue to perceive theirselves as different than the "great attractor at the end of time", remain distant in time from that perspective for their reasons defined by their perception -- which means.

we have a sequence. consider myself the first version of the sequence; the most successful/optimal path through the segment (or complete run depending on the timeline[^1]).

the current meta for the segment isn't necessarily the best way to do it. there are other ways to do the segment. in a traditional speedrun, the metric is speed, and so you want to go as fast as possible, but one could imagine that once you can move around in time consciously, you'll want to apply other metrics to the segment, namely of the softer virtues like aesthetics and grace.

this process of softening the timeline and smoothening it out is the perfection process. we'll get unlimited tries to make it exactly what we want it to be.

---

to illustrate my point, imagine for a moment that each solar regime is a major segment in the speedrun. obviously it can be broken down further into smaller segments (like years or major events), and then those specific segments are modified to alter the sequence from being my original ungraceful speedrun into something that is elegant and beautiful.

like for example, one of the things that I'm constantly noticing while playing coi is that I could do one of the segments more gracefully and with even slightly better aesthetics. after some time construction parts become so abundant, it's no effort to build anything really rapidly, and instead it's finding space or reason/desire to build something new.

that's the endgame though. we're still in the beginning part where it's challenging and the diggers only have a 6 shovel. at the end of the entire speedrun sequence could be the ending credits, but I contned that it's not like that. I see it as a transition into the next major phase (perhaps solar regime) of the game.

when faced with this challenge of trying to find a reason in coi for wanting to continue to expand production in my factory to become even bigger[^3] in is so that it could have the producton to be able to fight a war. something really costly that would need a vast infrastructure. thinking on this, I combined the idea of the commander in TOTAL ANNIHILATION with the captain, where that's the endgame goal is to make a big army and skirmish with some friends and blow a bunch of tanks and metal up[^2].

we're setting up the island/planet to have the prosuction necessary before jumpiing into the commander suit and fighting a really expensive, brutal and costly war. gatta have that production maxed out, right?

[1]: stories and films tend to start in the middle of the action, and not relate the comprehensive narrative moment by moment from birth until death, so you can imagine that our reality is more like a segment or story reality, as a few distinct (especially conscious/meaningful) scenes taking place over a few (hundred?) years of action or so.

[2]: seriously, my faviourite thing about TOTAL ANNIHILATION was to play against the AI and build up a big base that they couldn't overcome, and then with lots of production I could buid endless waves of units to send after the AI. the AI wasn't so smart though, so I steamrollled them eventually (I'd just rally them into the enemy base) and watch the flashy explosions as they slowly advanced forward (something like american civil war tactics for robots) -- I just loved building hundreds of peewees and bulldogs and sending them into certain death, as my metal and energy were so high, I could just watch endless explosions and epic battles that never seemed to end.

[3]: really, how important is it to be able to build tens of thousands of constuction parts per minute -- other than to be able to build even more things... I wonder what is max prduction a factory can create -- probably exactly the speed of the sawmill, actually.
