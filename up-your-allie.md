# up-your-allie

### 2023-01-15 04:28 - hi

so, I was outside smoking and thinking about my audience a bit in response to some reactions. I was explaining that I definitely do *not* want to make any life-changing[^2] decisions, while I'm stoned. the reason ...  anyway, the "reason" why I find that strange is the same "reason"[^1] I wanted to write "life-changing" is the "reason" I came in to write this -- meaning they are of the same intuition.

anyway, the "reason" why I'm writing this is to tell the story of how I realised that the audience kinda still likes a goofy guy in a shed smoking and exploring life. I'm really a pleasant alternative to a lot of other (media type) things they can consume instead, I guess; anyway, that was the reaction. I doint think they're really ready to see a guy around a bunch of girls, I would assume. I'm not really sure. anyway, I'm not really one to think so much about how others perceive me, so I was wondering where that thought came from :)
therefore, to jump right in on the action, I decided to start off strong with the predefinition of the concept up-your-allie -- which will instead be this rambling monologue. your welcome.
this is how I deal with problems of perception; which is head-on: I just jump right in to the worst possible perception, and then work my way up.

[1]: "reason" is a fealing sequence of justification concepts that I have as a prefix to a concept. often times I enumerate at least a few when writing before beginning to write the concept

[2]: I'm really bothered by the fact that I really wanted to write "life-changing" instead of "life changing" because, as a concept, "life-changing" can mean something entirely arbitrary.

so, what I was saying is that I'm kinda on a really chill vibe right, so I was thinking we should keep it that way.
