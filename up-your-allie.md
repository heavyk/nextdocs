# up-your-allie

### 2023-01-15 04:28 - hi

so, I was outside smoking and thinking about my audience a bit in response to some reactions. I was explaining that I definitely do *not* want to make any life-changing[^2] decisions, while I'm stoned. the reason ...  anyway, the "reason" why I find that strange is the same "reason"[^1] I wanted to write "life-changing" is the "reason" I came in to write this -- meaning they are of the same intuition.

anyway, the "reason" why I'm writing this is to tell the story of how I realised that the audience kinda still likes a goofy guy in a shed smoking and exploring life. I'm really a pleasant alternative to a lot of other (media type) things they can consume instead, I guess; anyway, that was the reaction. I doint think they're really ready to see a guy around a bunch of girls, I would assume. I'm not really sure. anyway, I'm not really one to think so much about how others perceive me, so I was wondering where that thought came from :)
therefore, to jump right in on the action, I decided to start off strong with the predefinition of the concept up-your-allie -- which will instead be this rambling monologue. your welcome.
this is how I deal with problems of perception; which is head-on: I just jump right in to the worst possible perception, and then work my way up.

[1]: "reason" is a fealing sequence of justification concepts that I have as a prefix to a concept. often times I enumerate at least a few when writing before beginning to write the concept

[2]: I'm really bothered by the fact that I really wanted to write "life-changing" instead of "life changing" because, as a concept, "life-changing" can mean something entirely arbitrary.

so, what I was saying is that I'm kinda on a really chill vibe right, so I was thinking we should keep it that way.

### 2023-01-15 05:05 - what would helena do?

what's happening is obvious. I'm exactly reflecting you back to you. I think the actors figured out how to manipulate me, like they manipulate girls. yesterday, I also noticed myself starting to act like sara[^1], too -- which was anyway -- I'm the reflector. I'm a near perfect reflector because I have such little resistance. that means whatever energy you have going on, I'll be behaving like both an amplifier of it (in my behaviour) and also in how I react to the emotional/conceptual output of those around me. I'm quite sensitive, and quite loud.

so here's the thing that I was thinking... your feeling (the way I felt during the reaction above), was that of not good enough. like everything is a joke on me. helena has a similar feeling, but it's not quite 100% the same. either way, the concept is similar in that it's also not-good-enoughness seen from a different angle though. if I'm the running joke or I'm the reason why everything is always going wrong, then I'm "not good enough" for whomever is the top guy in charge. the way that I get around this is I simply don't compete.

for me, the no compete came natural because I'm in spain with all these hot shots, and I'm a cripple kid still. however, the no compete is much easier to get the hang of probably for someone quite physically capable is because I can never really truly win and be top dog. top dog is an illusion. there's *always* going to be someone faster/better/stronger/whatever than I am. top dog is an illusion, huh, OK so then why not just *convince* all my friends I'm top dog; rathar than actually having to perform, so I can instead ride on their illusion. competition turns into a pissing contest of illusions and fakery real quick. sales people love this cockwaving. I don't want any part of it. I don't have anything to prove to anyone; only to myself.

and even then, no longer needing to prove anything to anyone else, I can't ever really prove anything to myself either, because I'm already: always right. I don't need to prove that I'm always right. other people just see my rightness differently than I do.

[1]: I decided I'm just going to keep spelling it different, because I noticed today my concept of her is different than her physical instantiation of her and "Sarah" is a reference to that -- and also is very different (from both of our perspectives) to my concept of her.
