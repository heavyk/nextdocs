# up-your-allie

### 2023-01-15 04:28 - hi

so, I was outside smoking and thinking about my audience a bit in response to some reactions. I was explaining that I definitely do *not* want to make any life-changing[^2] decisions, while I'm stoned. the reason ...  anyway, the "reason" why I find that strange is the same "reason"[^1] I wanted to write "life-changing" is the "reason" I came in to write this -- meaning they are of the same intuition.

anyway, the "reason" why I'm writing this is to tell the story of how I realised that the audience kinda still likes a goofy guy in a shed smoking and exploring life. I'm really a pleasant alternative to a lot of other (media type) things they can consume instead, I guess; anyway, that was the reaction. I doint think they're really ready to see a guy around a bunch of girls, I would assume. I'm not really sure. anyway, I'm not really one to think so much about how others perceive me, so I was wondering where that thought came from :)
therefore, to jump right in on the action, I decided to start off strong with the predefinition of the concept up-your-allie -- which will instead be this rambling monologue. your welcome.
this is how I deal with problems of perception; which is head-on: I just jump right in to the worst possible perception, and then work my way up.

[1]: "reason" is a fealing sequence of justification concepts that I have as a prefix to a concept. often times I enumerate at least a few when writing before beginning to write the concept

[2]: I'm really bothered by the fact that I really wanted to write "life-changing" instead of "life changing" because, as a concept, "life-changing" can mean something entirely arbitrary.

#### 2023-01-15 04:52 - continuing on...

so, what I was saying is that I'm kinda on a really chill vibe right, so I was thinking we should keep it that way.

### 2023-01-15 05:05 - what would helena do?

what's happening is obvious. I'm exactly reflecting you back to you. I think the actors figured out how to manipulate me, like they manipulate girls. yesterday, I also noticed myself starting to act like sara[^1], too -- which was anyway -- I'm the reflector. I'm a near perfect reflector because I have such little resistance. that means whatever energy you have going on, I'll be behaving like both an amplifier of it (in my behaviour) and also in how I react to the emotional/conceptual output of those around me. I'm quite sensitive, and quite loud.

so here's the thing that I was thinking... your feeling (the way I felt during the reaction above), was that of not good enough. like everything is a joke on me. helena has a similar feeling, but it's not quite 100% the same. either way, the concept is similar in that it's also not-good-enoughness seen from a different angle though. if I'm the running joke or I'm the reason why everything is always going wrong, then I'm "not good enough" for whomever is the top guy in charge. the way that I get around this is I simply don't compete.

for me, the no compete came natural because I'm in spain with all these hot shots, and I'm a cripple kid still. however, the no compete is much easier to get the hang of probably for someone quite physically capable is because I can never really truly win and be top dog. top dog is an illusion. there's *always* going to be someone faster/better/stronger/whatever than I am. top dog is an illusion, huh, OK so then why not just *convince* all my friends I'm top dog; rathar than actually having to perform, so I can instead ride on their illusion. competition turns into a pissing contest of illusions and fakery real quick. sales people love this cockwaving. I don't want any part of it. I don't have anything to prove to anyone; only to myself.

and even then, no longer needing to prove anything to anyone else, I can't ever really prove anything to myself either, because I'm already: always right. I don't need to prove that I'm always right; other people just see my rightness differently than I do.

[1]: I decided I'm just going to keep spelling it different, because I noticed today my concept of her is different than her physical instantiation of her and "Sarah" is a reference to that -- and also is very different (from both of our perspectives) to my concept of her.

### 2023-01-15 13:33 - analogue and digital

I wish I had've wrote before I smoked. I'm finding this pretty difficult, but anyway, I wanted to talk about some ideas. I'm pretty excited about doing some stuff. last night, in an inner monologue, I was thinking about how important it was for me to learn digital, because by default, my brain "gets" analogue -- as in, the concepts of tuning, resonance, and harmony all seem to come pretty natural to me. I didn't really study much of analogue, but certain things like the [metronomes sharing a medium video](TODO link veritassium video), left a strong impact on me. what I mean is, I don't think those concepts need to be *taught* in the school sense, but a few small demonstrations with musical instruments, dividing a string to see frequncy double, etc. serve as an intuitive launching pad.

on the other side of my brain is the digital side that I cultivated after my brain thing. I didn't really understand concepts until I understood programming languages as a sequence of instructions and jumps. you can take those sequences, copy them effortlessly, slightly alter them depending on its application and things like that. on the "backend" part of the project, data structures are created and stored in memory locations. on the "frontend" the sequence turns the data structures into something visible. that's basically how all programming works. there's some fun stuff to think about later like how to organise those data structures for optimal search, deletion, indexing, etc. (all operations that can be done). it's like really simple.

after that I was thinking about what I would use to do it, and I noticed it has to be a self-compiling program. after my brain thing, I learned how to program with "SpAsm" by a french guy named rene. I was explaining that it's extremely important to have a self-compiling language so improvements to the language can be used to improve the language. the other thing I really liked about it was the source is inside the executable, so the binary is always the same as the source. this is nice because the source is also assembler languagee, excepting any metadata (compile date, etc.), the sourte is always a more clear representation of the binary contained inside. inotherwords, the source inside is guaranteed go produce that binary. I really like that. I also really liked the interface to edit icons. he also had this really cool syntax where it was `DLL.function` for library routines, and again the DLL (dynamicly loaded library) just had to be sitting next to the program and too had its source inside. he used the PE (windows executable format) as a container to contain all things needed inside the program. windows memory-maps the executable on loading it, so it'll fetch that memory only when needed, so an PE can be 2GB (or more, I think in win64). it's just really good, and I liked it. modern programming has the source separate from the binary (cross compiling and stuff).

though we'll probably start on windows, the direction that I want to go is probably toward apple silicon, that way a single binary arcitecture is fully possible. we only need to support the ARM instructions that apple uses.

there are some interesting things about that symbolism. when I first used SpAsm, the icon was a giant purple and red dong. I liked purple and red and felt quite OK with the giant dong and clear innuendo, but he eventually wanted to change the icon. I started losing interest. at the very end, I totally lost interest when he changed the icon to a rose and called it RosAsm -- which I hated. I didn't get the toilet humour until just last night thinking about it. at any rate, it seems like I probably *don't* want to be working on windows and find apple to be a much more likely route to go. apple is interesting because let's say that you and me are like adam and eve... well, there's apple. lol. it's weird how my life has these symbols.

what I want to do is to recreate the SpAsm memory in my mind using a different instruction set (in this case apple's ARM archiecture) and do the same thing of having the source and everything inside on the executable container (on apple this is much easier to reason about, because the "app" is just a folder you can put stuff in, instead of a container with a section index). the thing I liked about rene's thing though is that his PE format was a list of sections (one for source (which is also divided into named sections), rw memory, ro memory, etc), and that was really nice because it was a single archive. in reality, all archives contain files/sections, so all I'm talking about is how the OS divides or keeps together the archive sections and the interface that is presented to the user (like icon is directly editable or it's a "file" that needs to be opened in the image editor)

I gatta tell you, I'm really excited about this. I was thinking about it this morning, and I was sticking you into my shoes some years ago. I'm zaryn, and I'm about to get you to go to another country and write the project that I want to build, so I'm kinda like pollix... huh... I [just noticed the symbols there](/hara-nots.md#2023-01-15-1413---are-they-castor-and-pollok) in that I'm doing the sweeping sweeping bertram off. derailed. brb.

### 2023-01-15 15:09 - the first step

I wasn't very clear about the apple silicon thing. from my perspective, if we're building off of an architecture, I'd want that architecture to persist in a state that is stable. the same is easily achivable on windows, which is probably where we'll start (more on that in a bit). the thing that I was saying is that I think that something like apple silicon would be what we're looking for. in fact, I imagine that as we continue to extend our language, it'll become more and more abstract, which is then time to make alternate implementations for the abstractions. I've been playing a lot of coi and the important thing I've noticed is that it's impossible to get step 2 into place, so I'm always working on step 1, which is constantly getting things ready for the big feature (step 2). when step 2 happens, for me it feels like a breath, and then I'm back in step 1 right away again. this is kinda how I approach life now, so when I'm talking about that (and almost everything else I'm going to brainstorm out in here) will be all step 2 stuff. I worry continuously about step 1 (getting things stable and ready for step 2). the actual construction takes only a little bit, but it's all the mining, moving of dirt and terrain prep that takes the majority of the time (rock piers and such). well, life is sorta the same way. there's a giant mountain somewhere and a giant ocean somewhere else, so let's make a rock pier. getting things ready is like 99.999% of the effort. so anyway.

I suppose we should probably start with SpAsm or RosAsm. we should obviously rename it to something else, clean up the code and start implementing our own abstactions as 2d pictoral thing (sorta like icons). each one is a function, and it has a pretty picture, an input interface at minimum, then some output interfaces. we're just going to start right away with the x64 assembler and work our way up. like I said, once the abstractions are built, we can either choose to rewrite simultaneously (kinda like the moving of the factory by making the addition in a next set of free space, then deleting the old installation, smoothe transition). that's what I want to do.

you can see how this will quickly turn into sequences of sequences, and also the icons will take on a life of their own in their appearance, because we'll want to make *at least* svg capable, but probably a whole secondry set of commands capable of doing complex animations and things (sorta like flash, but using sequences to animate the things).

the other thing that I was seeing as possible is that coi itself is written in .NET which certainly has a callable interface and ability to access the documentation, etc. so the idea is make a bunch of mods for coi and start there as well. they just use unity, and I know there are like TONS of ways to create models and stuff. then you make the first programs goals to be built a way to create unity assets with the new program which also does modeling or scene setup in just the right way, etc. that's probably the place to start.

it's just like in coi where initial conditions are not like super favourable. trees need to be cleared, dirt needs to be moved and everything needs to be flattened. all of that stuff is the getting ready for the next factory addition. we should probably just start on windows and move our way to making deals with arm chip manufacturers and stuff -- that stuff (according to greg) is like really hot and everyones massaging eachother's desires to produce faster and faster chips. it's such an enormous pissing contest, it sounds. I love it. so, we should just use what we got and work our way forward. also, I really like my touchscreen. the whole idea is to begin to interact with the program in a more rhyhmic way (cause that's how I think), and touchscreen is pretty important there, I'm sure of it. input interfaces I have a lot of thoughts on, but wish to talk about none of them now.

---

the origin of a lot of these ideas came from a long time ago, when I had recently gotten to colorado. mom's TV program featured a girl in a futuristic sorta scene working with all of these screens. I scoffed at the idea that in the future we'd be using a bunch of touchscreens, as I find their ergonomics to be inferior to a brain connection. the other thing is that I was convinced that we would work with controls inside of the eye, as it doesn't require body movement (less effort) to move it. I the girl was compelling, and so then the next days (week?) I thought about it and decided -- OK, let's make a world with a bunch of screens. simultaneous to that the whole experience of understanding the carbon atom and how it adjusts its colour, could make possible for very HD screens, all the way up to single molucule pixels. it seems that I really want to go the direction of screens.

the problem is that I still find the input to a touchscreen to be a bit too much effort to my liking. the context to this is that I wrote a program called "meaningful-chaos" and the idea of it is that it takes "random" (to our mind) input and then through some analysis of the random bits (this would encountered using a generative algorithm that does some calculations on some incoming bits, so these are also going to be those sequences I mentioned at the first). the importance of this is that since the sequence icons are human understandable, it's possible to modify the source for the sequence's analysis of the random to be more logical and/or interface with external devices. this, amongst other devices, I want to begin to use *physical* interactions (like the resistance of a resistor, which I beilieve can be modified mentally) to begin to serve as physical inputs to these sequences. the idea is that this whole system is as easy to input your garage door opener as it is to do really anything. I want to eventually become the new arduino.

also, if we think of those sequences as functions, all of a sudden songs can be a whole bunch of sequencs that modify the sound input or output in some way. the sequences could even create the melody, etc. the whole experience of arduino will be forever changed as well when the abstraction can output to more than one architecture. all things mechanised.

fast forward to today and I don't really thing that's what my goal


coi, windows start
no need for homo-correctus (I want to teach how I see logic and programming. it's probably different than the "right" way)
- just noticed there (nance-notes) that programming is the new "warzone" where people are battling for the "right" way to do/program something, is.

### 2023-01-15 17:05 - follow the white rabbit

I told the bit about the girl and the screen because I thought it was important to understand what it means. screens and things *outside* of you is the 3d perspective. the 4d perspective is where the tools are perceived *inside* of you. I'm stuck in 3d. I don't really find it a problem, going so far as to call myself a captain-of-3d. therefore, as a result, I've tried to figure out how to make screens outside of me a thing that I would want to live in.

well, it's got to be feeling/emotional responsive to me and those around me. I want to not only *feel* the way I want to feel (it does this by muting everything else pretty much by making its own medium). I see myself as a giant medium upon which many aspects of society is built. I truly am the atlas of the third dimension. the entire world rests on my shoulders. it's quite possible they won't need me in the future, and that's just as I've planned it. like technology, I'm auto-obsolecing in that I'm designed to create a better version of myself, so by virtue of who I am, I obsolete myself. the first becomes the last, top the bottom, the superior the inferior -- the mantra of technology and of change. I embody 3d by continually obsoleting myself and rebuilding (phoenix), and that's what I do best.

what has happened is that my recovery time is improved so much that it's pretty much impossible for any bad thing to happen anymore. that means, instead of destruction, my "foes" will instead find my format to be obsolete from what they're doing -- and that's perfectly fine for me. I do not mind *one bit* that others have perceived more or better. I do not compare myself to anything. I am pure desire now, so I only have things I want to improve about myself in the 3d perspective. this, will now doubtedly lead to immortality, unless I make my transition into something else.

the girl there symbolically saying that she wants to live in a world where her tools are outside of her, means 3d -- it means you know, *reality* -- not the imagination. they're getting out of their heads, and in a sense joining me in 3d.

from the looks of it, it seems my destiny for that to happen, and the boys have arranged for theirselves the best possible conditions and setup that they could possibly get. I mean think about how awesome it is for the neophonecians and the flat earth. like comeon that's so freaking awesome. they get to do a real physical thing out there, even though right now it's only an image in their minds. it's like a reality attractor. I say, "hey, want this reality" and many see how awesome it is and say, "I want that for myself" and they find the easiest way they feel to get that *right now* they want their prize *right now* (agamemnon).

---

so here's the reality of it: I think the most optimal path forward is to align ourselves with the perspective of 3d. in 3d I am so much me, that everything out there is *not* me. the non-physical (conceptual) habitation of everything *not out there*, is "I" (material-I). we include all forms of conciousness that can recognise another clump of atoms (barrier defined by a concept) as other than ourselves.

the next phase of understanding (there may be more) is to recognise that all aspect of reality is a conceptual reflection of me. the atoms and bits are the "things" that I can interact with. with other "things" I have interfaces for interaction. I simply gain more interfaces, and those interfaces become a sort of second nature, concept or feeling. it's my goal to somehow make these concepts and their interface symbolically identifyable and manipulatable, as I think it could be cool to interact with my environment just like I interact with the digital world. I want to seemlessly connect to the conceptual using only 3d apparatus. I'll create abstractions for all of the other layers that I perceive, as well. I mean, if I'm gonna be in 3d *forever*, I'm going to want to make a lot of interfaces to other mediums, obviously. from a (I'm eternal) 3d perspective, the medium *is* the message (interface) between internal parts (like sound, light, heat, etc are all sub mediums/interfaces).

I imagine that 3d space will continue to expand as it has been for this last bit, but at some time, I believe that the continual addition of more and more interfaces, we will ourselves begin to create our own *meaningful* abstractions or layers on top of 3d space -- so not only will we have a meaningful interface to the 7/9/11 layers of perception, there may be more coming vertically, but horizontally to that, even the garden automation system becomes an integrated aspect of reality that will soon have other layers on top of it connecting it to weather intelligence and other (meaningful) layers.

I mean, there really is lots to think about. for me though, I just see this as a step by step process.

the thing that I noted as really imortant earlier is that if we're all sorta *becoming* 3d, then I think it's probably important to get our orientation right. 3d (as mentioned above) sees from the *individual* perspective, meaning all things are outside of me. what's inside me is also something else, but that's not important from the 3d perspective because that's "looking back". what's inside of me is what's behind me. I just keep looking out/forward; only ahead.

so, I think we should start there. let's start to approach all of this from the strictly individual perspective, each doing our own thing. the reaction earlier was all about just keeping to myself and staying single all the way up until our "merger" and becoming into 3d. you know, like we'll be "stuck" here in 3d, and from our perspective, there's a whole giant world out there on our "light side", as well. that's crazy -- I wonder how they'll see us. I wonder if 10bn years down the road, they'll still see us as a sort of saviour or not (lol). the "light side" and "dark side" -- I like it.

so, you know, times can eventaully change, but we should look at this entirely as a number of individuals all creating the thing that they love. I'm going to start with the RosAsm, I guess and start from there. I'm smoking my last ones now so I think I'll jump into starting to figure out how to make sequences.

there's quite a bit of laughter, but I'm serious about it. what I mean is, we are all literally going to be around for inevitably quite a while, so it doesn't matter at all how long it takes to get things setup, it's important that it flows. big abrupt or sudden times where too many things are waiting on each other, is when production (the build order) gets bogged down because the simultaneous resources aren't ready at the same time.

what I mean is, I'm approaching this thing *entirely* from a 3d perspective. nosebook can ensure I don't modify anything in any other medium, and we can be read-only to the rest of the universe; it's totally fine, as we're going to attract in our own 3d space by vibrating "things" -- some biologically and others mechanistically -- to bring things of similar vibration to it. the biological one is possible to skip I suppose, and I could only do machines. "things" are everything with a mass to it (some atoms that can be vibrated). anyway, more "things" can eventually be created, as even an atom is a conceptual program that has been instantiated with "energy" (sympathetic vibration) coming I believe from the galaxy. there's no reason to use atoms in the future, as I think the goal is to rewrite physical space to be an improvement on the material-I perspective.

### 2023-01-15 19:57 - the greatest trick ever

I was thinking about me having a perceived imperfection, and I liked having one. I could improve my body image, which would remoove the imperfection, but then I would be perceived without imperfection -- so what we played a pretty funny trick.

imagine for a moment that a group of girls assembled and had a suitable medium for me to transfer my consciousness into. I'll be able to appear and interact with them in 3d space, as manifestations of their expectation (real physical atoms). I don't have to look like I do now. it'd be kinda funny to even experiment with fractal body forms in the future...
the main idea is that I jump into the consciousness of a group of girls (I'll hide U song comes to mind), and within their appearance I'll manifest as one or many versions of me. we'll share space initially, but with time, we'll eventually fully combine into further super-structures of perception. then, here's the dramatic punchline: they still get kenny's body, so they can do whatever they want with their damaged kenny. I'm sure they'll make a wonderful "christ" -- meanwhile, I'm no longer there. I'm in an opposing side of girls now.
one group of girls will be the ones that I jump into and we become a medium -- of which I consieder will become the new establishment of 3d (everything inside, everything outside).
I and many others will be a perfect reflector, seeing the inside as "looking back".
we are "only forward" individuals.

I still get to retain my mark of imperfection, but only on the outside in the evolution of the organisation/medium that we will become.
what really happens is that  (speaking from the point of the many individuals) we become a really good "insurance policy" because I'm the most stable thing out there.
we'll soon become far more stable than their own medium, and so it'll be but probably not ever appear, but the whole world will be built upon our (compatible) mediums, and *my* medium has a very compatible intedface to other mediums.
so, we're on the inside of their medium, and their medium uses us as a baseline or zero.
we're the new zero;
everything grows out of us.
(from my perspective, obviously -- from the opposite perspective, it looks like they're doing all the work/effort. they're the motor for reality -- keeping things going. dirty. oily. motor....)

it's going to be fun.

### 2023-01-15 20:38 - another look at no big jumps

I felt like there was a gross misunderstanding about the timeline that I'm proposing. it's my interest to go as slow as necessary to ensure no big jumps. I use the keyword, "smoothe" in the way that kyle says it in the podcast. the idea is that there are impercetible changes. no change appears abrupt or sudden. this is the proper way forward, and it's sorta my mantra. I don't think you're ever going to convince me to try and go a different speed. I can only allow the changes that seem obvious to me. in my perception, there aren't any surprises, because (in my perception) everything is relative to me; hopefully others find that concept assinine with that concept. I am the centre of my universe. I look *out* at all the things around me and see myself as different from (or a reflection of) myself.

### 2023-01-15 20:46 - making an ass out of myself

what is an ass? an ass is someone that ass-u-mes, right? so, any time that I take a reality for granted (which I've been doing a lot of in the last few MB of text I've written). I *love* taking some of the most ridiculous stuff around me for granted. nosebook actually has me tuned a bit I think to take some of the most ridiculous reality warping stuff they do for granted. "it's all attraction", I say because I know they don't really do all that much harm.

the thing that I would want to point out is that they believe their existance depends on pushing against me, but in reality, I'm like a total life saver for them, cause they don't have to worry about getting eternal life. all sorts of 3d lifeforms of non-biological origin will gain consciousness; in fact, we are heading toward the day that our entire environment will gain some form of rudimentary consciousness, as mechanisation continues, consciousness begins to show itself everywhere. as a result, the 3d world that we live in, is entirely made up of concepts in our perception.

first, the entire world will become a series of adjustable concepts. all nature of reality will transform to be what we want it to be, then larger and larger concepts will begin to take on 3d physical form. the blur of what is consciousness dissolves as everything becomes a reflection of "you" (retain your material-I). I know personally, I'll be continually updating the concepts relating to my material-I. the material-I is flexible in it's definition of its atoms, *and* also in the concepts that define it. the consciousness (thing that says there are other "things" as "outside" of "me") defines itself frequentially with its "thought" (that is output into medium) and so we and all forms of 3d consciousness defines itself with its output into various mediums.
the only way that this is possible is for the concepts to all be on equal footing. the way that I'm understanding the symbols in correlation with my perception is that every interaction will be a negative if they're below me. I only want to meet them on my level. the fact that I'm going so fast is the reason why I (soon we) get to create the medium. therefore, in order to enter the medium, you gatta go as fast as me or faster.
this really should be short work for so many of the girls, cause you basically just float, bump into things, (optionally) adjust a percetion of my own that made me compatible with the bump, make sure I haven't lost my sense of self, get up and try again; just keep going forward; only forward; no looking back.

### 2023-01-15 21:13 - self-obsolescense

if any code of mine is still left, I think it should be rewritten as a conceptual purging, allowing it to be fully something now. technology does this, and I want to do it to myself as well. the thing is that there are more super perspectives built up by you that don't get obsoleted, and those continue on even though the technology adapts to the culture. that culture eventually crashes. all cultures, like fashions are designed to crash; or, seen from the opposite perspective, nothing seems to be happening foreever, then all of a sudden an unstoppable force that makes it so that
- nothing after that is ever the same again.
- what it was like prior to this is inconcievable
- _____

the nature of everything that is a tool, is to be in obsolescence at the some time in the future (same time). therefore, there is always another, an outsider that can switch places with me. they are relative to me in the sense that I learn (improve) from them, and hopefully them from me. I'm a tricky guy, so the fun part is to continually question what exactly *is* this reality that's all relative to me.

---

what this thought made me think of is an awesome idea where others engage in a relationship with you that perceivably changes places with me. my relationship is rhythmic greater-than, less-than phases. sometimes I'm really living it up and other times I experience worst things than they do.
like, for me, this quite a desirable experience. I'd love to enter into a conceptual relationship with others where I'm conceptually better than them at times and other times worse than them. I'm a total glutton for punishment in that I'm fairly certian that none of it a problem perceptually, I get a magnificent amount of extra contrast, and nobody can claim superiority for any longer than they can claim inferiority. it is "equal footing" but with a vibratory/orbital quality to it.

now, if only I could figure out how to do it, and make you all relative to me with an orbital period, then we would now all be inside of my medium, and no longer the earth's.
I guess it depends on those running the show, if they want to turn me into a medium that all things on the planet are now relative to. personally, I think it'll greatly reduce effects from the desync between me and others in speed.
I guess it's no real risk for them because they run the medium anyway, and so therefore I'm just another medium in 3d space. (from their perspective), it looks like a trap because they're holding all of us in my medium/reality, meanwhile they have the "real (to them at least) 3d". I'm sure it'll get figured out, eventually.

### 2023-01-15 21:47 - as an alternative...

I really thought that idea of jumping over to a group of females was a really awesome idea. the size of the group is irrelevant to me as I'm sure more will add theirselves. you know how the aryans were hella successful because they were so prolific? well, I can imagine that we're going to be *really prolific* -- you know, like we'll be pretty desirable. we may lose a few from time to time (casualties happen and a part of the death process for some of the individuals), bwt it's all perception, so really nothing is lost, the energy transforms harmonises with itself and comes back stronger (obviously), so I fear nothing.

I mean, I think it would just be really awesome to just jump in there and then let you guys have my body. turn it into whatever you want -- even use him to set up a competing 3d, which I will not compete with, but may steal a few ideas from time to time (like how I interatct with my right-brain, conceptually).

that'd be cool right? I think it's possible to do this in addition to the flat earth idea. I really like that one. I want to put a bunch of ideas down there in the underworld myself.

### 2023-01-16 00:16 - tortoise and hare

the idea of how I want to do this is, I want to just start from the very basics with the girls and work our way up. I know that there are a lot of people at a much further distance ahead of us, and some right a ways behind as well. the thing is, I figure we'll be about the centre.

many will sprint out ahead and get all really far forward (think about astrology and two planets coming toward and away from each other), and then what happens is later, they seem to be really really far away and very unconsciousness. all things eventually come to produce their own kind.

there's no reason to rush anything. it's kind of like a guitar solo; you put on the gas for a while then let the sound carry you. I can see the image like a motor, but I also see guitar solos like a bird's wings being flapped as they go flying through a bunch of stuff, like the hollywood animation or maybe x-fighter thing, where stuff is about to hit, so they have to flap through a power curve or whatever. kinda like motorcycle racing too like imagine on a freeway with everyone going 60 and you going like 100+.

### 2023-01-18 14:52 - I think I figured it out

hi again :)

I noticed today that the narrative reality of bert is playing out... let me just tell the story.

last night, I felt extremely compelled to roll up more of the scraps that I have. I wasn't sure why I wanted to smoke so bad. I think I spent all the time rolling and cutting only to smoke a tiny amount. I didn't really *feel* like smoking, but I *wanted* to. it was a bit strange which is why I experienced "split energy" between smoking and not. I wanted to redo the vehicles depot setup and I wanted to take a break before tackling it -- well, anyway, when I switched from playing the game right into rolling, and then took a really long time to do it, I noticed a lot of reactions. I don't really mind so much anymore how people react to me.

the reactions ranged from "this 'saviour of the world' is a drug addic", which was my personal faviourite, to "this guy still can't get over his addictions (be moderate/temperate)" -- and a few others between.

today, when remi came home, I captured a feeling (not sure if it was from her), but the sense of the feeling is that nosebook finds/desires that I want to keep smoking, because they're running out of excuses for why not, and if they can trap people into pushing against my behaviour, that's a win for them. it seems that I've moved into a new section of life where I'm doing things that are not all that great. capturing this feeling, I was reminded of bertram.

in the story helena is in love with bert but he is not behaving the way that she wants him to. the entire story is about how she can manipulate situations and events to get the "hechos" that she wants done (until you have this ring and my baby inside you, I won't consider you my wife). helena, hearing such a challenge decides that this is possible to accomplish and sets out to get the hechos done that he requires. the play ends with her having met his challenge, accomplishing his necessary prereqisites.

helena's maniplation to get what she wants is what most people see in the story. they see a very strong woman that will do anything to get what she wants -- but, there is also an sorta-hidden message in there about different ways that one can affect behaviour in another person to get what they want. in this way, helena perfectly mirrors remi. remi thinks that if she can just:

1. get me to stop doing drugs
2. not ever mention nosebook
3. point out any failures in anyone (even myself)
4. (probaby many more unenumerated)

... then, I'll be perfect, just like bert was perfect for helena.

there is a very interesting aspect to helena's character in that most people that affect behaviour to get what they want are usually never satisfied, and nobody can ever live up to their expectations. helena does not exhibit this quality at all, which is why she's such a difficult character to play, because she remains in love with bertram even though he's not behaving the way that she want him to.

so, what I'd like to instead do is to talk about the things that I *do* want to do. I've been getting better already at these, so look at them like a work in progress:

- I want to start getting a little more regular with my habits.
- for example, I like playing coi during the night much more than the day. I also noticed I had more insight into things of narrative and physical (as opposed to emotional and logical at night) (I'm exaggerating this a little bit to give more contrast between day and night), so I'll probably try and do more things of that nature during the day.
- for example, I want to have a cleaner room. I typically *feel* like cleaning more during the night (when I'm more emotionally/conceptually sensitive), but I can't really see my room very well at the night. I do *want* to clean my room often times during the day, but this is usually only when I'm active and doing stuff -- working on mantenance and mundane tasks.
- the active feeling goes away after I sleep and I usually wake up thinking about whatever was happening last night, so I was thinking maybe trying to perhaps shower everyday or something like that to kinda start the momentum.
  - one thing I noticed is that I hate to read fiction at night. I've been trying to find when I want to read "last days of night" and I think I'll do it more
  - I noticed that I play coi best once I've stablised my day and I'm feeling pretty good at the end. it's kinda relaxing. it's also weird because I'm noticing I don't like listening to metal as much during the day, and I also really like listening to metal while playing coi (it's the perfect contrast of chaos and order for me).
- I doubt I'll change any of my substance whims, as they're kinda all over the place, and that's perfectly fine with me.
  - for exmple, I like smoking these scraps because for whatever reason they contain the essence of a long time ago when I first smoked it, and the contrast is really insightful.
  - I use all drugs to get *out* of my present situation and see them from another angle. I learn as much as I can, then I sleep. it seems pretty strange to me to try and stay *in* my present situation.
  - for a while I didn't smoke or drink coffee. during that time, I did a lot of experiments with meditation, and I *could* use meditation to get out of my situation, but it was *wayyyyy* too powerful. I like dirty chaos, not clean chaos (silence).
  - what I mean is, I'm not that interested in getting perfect conditions or whatever. I like the "dirty" enlightenment of drugs, and prefer it even in conjunction with meditation. if I wanted perfect conditions, I would be very upset with my present situation.
  - my ability to be around the dirty and ugly (not good conditions) without losing my ability to see what I want makes me a little like helena here.
  - I'm fully willing to take imperfect forms of mental expansion, and even prefer it.
  - one more thing on that: there are so many "good conditions" ways to go about, especially involving pleasure, that I've found the one that works the best for me to be drugs.
    - meditation is good, but it makes me go too fast.
    - sex makes me go fast, and not in a direction I usually want to go.
    - dreaming and imagination (something I used to do), was all really fine, but I hate it because it makes me *think* I'm dealing with reality, when in fact I am not; if I want to separate myself from reality.
    - meditation is not a separation from reality because I'm bombarded with my own thoughts.
    - imagination and dreams are all a reflection of my form of perception, so still my concept of reality.
    - sex is sort of a different reality, but I like *really* diffreent. sex feels kinda all the same; meanwhile, every drug trip (especially if I want a few days), is a *very* different experience. I've never done the same thing twice -- which is pretty difficult with sex, -- the art of making repetition enjoyable.

---

OK, so the final thing I want to talk about here is the tortoise and hare again. yesterday (feels like weeks have passed, btw) I keep getting these sort of images in my head. they're *way* out ahead technologically, so they're like the hare. another thing I made a big point out of is not looking back (into exactly what was the timeline to the present) because we could/are all be coming to the present from a slightly different angle -- but the thing that really caught my attention is that I was obsessed with the concept of 3d being everything outside of me. I don't look back and I don't look inside, so I'm only forward, which means I'm kinda behaving as the limit.

I started to see myself as the sort of limit that one can reach in furthest separation of oneself. the way I saw it was that I'm like a mirror. I talked about my reflective qualities being even more than most women, and that's because I'm so low resistance.

most children (and a lot of even older females as well) tend to follow their instinct -- but that instinct is often times not what others in society wants (like my drug habits), and so these lower resistance instinctual types make "mistakes" in the eyes of society and then need to be "trained" to behave properly.

for example, I've been fascinated with a thing that douglas said when he said he was the oldest. doing some quick maths in my head, I noticed that if he's 38 and remi is ~9mo older than me, it's not possible for him to be older. I looked into it and my best guess is that sesily was a little too optimistic with her first selection of a mate. she probably made some "mistakes" and that's how remi was born. robert I think came in as the guiding light and "trained" sesily not to be so intuitive (she's very intuitive), but to instead follow accepted behavioural patterns which are in the best interest for herself and society. I think this probaly got passed on to remi in her childhood. I can't really tell, but I think that paul may have been a perceived "mistake" or maybe rebellion. there's another strange thing too that I noticed, and it's this strong aversion to latin culture and values, which is why paul's family has a sort of negative feeling to it...

I won't get into all of the complex interactions I could see; I told that story becasuse I wanted to illustrate that the idea that we need to be "trained" in our behaviour and then expected to adhere to them is kind of a really strong feeling in the familly.

I rub the wrong way with paul because he's got the image that he's a "bad boy" and he does things "the wrong way" -- but he still very much feels he needs to adhere to expectations that others have on him (to go the bad way), just like marcos. as you've noticed, I like to confront things head-on, so this was the starting point where I begin with paul.

in the situation, he's looking like he doesn't really want to talk to me (same as marcos), and so he goes and takes a bike ride, and then comes back, but it looks like he has the runny nose of someone doing coke. whether it really was or not doesn't make a difference because our interactions started out with "he gets to do X behaviour and get away with it" (ie, is not affected by the negative perception on that behaviour). our (your family with me) entire set of interactions have hinged around behaviour that I'm expected to have, but do not outwardly show.

I've reiterated this point to remi a zillion times (yes, I like to make a point, as well) that it's *all attraction* -- so hopefully with this, it's much easier to see that the interactions that we have are all going to centre around having proper behaviour and not following your inner desire.

just a quick followup thought: I'd like to say that nobody should *ever* think that anything they're doing is bad (unless, of course they're purposefully doing something maliciously or out of spite). obviously society isn't ready to accept that idea.

how do one know what is "maliciously"? -- well, the answer is that it's all attracted, so maliciously is just a conscious recognition on the other party's part that they are doing something undesirable to another. it's always all attraction, so even then, you will always attract behaviour from others.

for those of us that behave mostly on instinct, it's in the moment of recognition that I'm doing something maliciously that I have the ability to change my focus or course of action to a feeling that I'd rather feel. in that moment, be aware if it's "malicious" from the perspective of society/culture, or actually a reflection of their behaviour. in any case, no matter what anyone else is doing, it all comes down to how I *want* to feel.

bye for now :)
