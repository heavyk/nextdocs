### 2021-11-06 - senet

have you read chapter 24 in "understanding media" by marshall mcluhan? it's dense reading, but he basically explains how games sort of encode the mentality of the culture of their origin.

so thinking about that, I was noticing how the game of senet encodes this idea that you need to be "lucy" or favoured by the gods to win the game. you have to throw the correct number of moves in order to win. if you don't, there are a number of hazards that will keep you stuck or forever having to go back and start over.

if you're lucky to throw the right numbers, you get granted entrance into the afterlife. if not you're forever going to go back and try again.

one could imagine that for the really competitive, it was a huge pissing contest to be the luckiest -- probably lots of good luck charms, incantations, curses (to set your opponent back) -- and maybe for the really competitive, illusions and power plays (to establish one's dominance)...

we only have the game left, but it would be interesting to go back in a time machine and watch a competitve game.

### 2021-12-07 - message to dr. strong about sun heating the night

hi dr. strong,

a peculiar thing happened when that m-class flare happened. it was night time here where I live and the night suddenly got very warm and the temperature rose from 28F to 59F when it happened at around 4am here. I was awake when it happened and was surprised at how crisp and warm the night was (reminded me of a summer night).

there's the temperature graph for me. looking over to where you're at, the effect didn't seem to be so much: https://www.windy.com/station/madis-AR511?41.544,-72.437,8

however, up in wyoming and other places, it appears they had warmer weather for the whole duration of the outburst: https://www.windy.com/station/ad-KRKS?39.525,-108.211,6

it appears that this warming of the weather happened all across the united states, but less prominantly on the coasts. here's ohio for example: https://www.windy.com/station/ad-KFDY?32.424,-92.180,5

I know you said in your global warming video that the solar flares has even a negative effect on warming (less irradiance), but it was night time so that's zero irradiance and yet it warmed up quite a lot. is there any way to explain this phenomena? is it well known? surely I'm not the only one that has noticed this...

anyway, thanks for everything,
kenny

### 2021-12-07 - letter to michael and anastasia

this was a very difficult interview to listen to. through the whole thing, not once did he actually talk about how electric current works. the entire time was spent with him trying to be right and his theory (which was never mentioned) accepted. the few times that he began to actually talk about it, he was interrupted with silly things like "define energy before you continue" or "explain what the sun is emitting". there were no attempts to even try to figure out what he was saying. it seemed to me like he's trying to say that it's not the electrons that are moving but the opposite charge -- so protons -- I guess.

I guess the weird thing for me is that you guys were not allowing him to actually begin to brainstorm out his idea by constantly forcing definitions and name dropping -- which is nearly the same thing that mainstream science is doing. law of attraction must be true in that you are becoming the thing you're giving your attention to (fighting against).

the covid economic advisors joke was funny though...

instead of listening to a 2h argument, it would be nice to hear a brainstorming on how to explain the person's theory without any name dropping or big worded concepts. I think it would be fine to be loose with definitions until a concept is established. "energy" is good enough. it doesn't need to fit into an atom.

a thought is a form of energy, but can you locate the atoms which compose it? likewise, a wave in the pool is energy, but neither can you say that this group of water molecules in the pool contains the energy of that wave, or does the pool contain the energy? if energy is movement, then we're not talking about the rails, but the train.

I've given this concept a lot of thought and I've come around to thinking of protons (aten, or whatever it is you call the stuff coming from the sun) being the fundamental form of electricity for quite a while now. however, the problem is that it would appear to me that these protons are something of physical manifestations of consciousness. that consciousness is vibrating and would appear to us as light. the "problem" with this theory though is that it means that consciousness is imbued into everything, neutrons don't exist (they're just electron and proton pairs), and that our sun is composed 100% of protons, when then affects the electron pairs and these interactions produce all of the elements.

obviously that theory sounds a bit nuts and I have no way to prove it (nor do I ever intend to do so. it's just fun to think about). I really think science is a form of philosophy, and going back to law of attraction for a moment: consider that if, your philosophy is formed in such a way where you believe that "all is matter". now, when conducting your experiment, you construct it in such a way to prove your hypothesis. are also the observer of your own experiments too, so those experiments will have to "prove" your philosophy that everything is matter. it's very unlikely that a scientist will get unexpected/unexplained results and come to the conclusion their philosophy is wrong.

likewise, if I have a philosophy that everything is a manifestation of consciousness (eg. what you attract by giving your attention to it), then again I am the observer to my own experiments and my consciousness will "prove" my own beliefs to be right.

I really wouldn't wait for science to change their philosophy. if you need someone to change, that's law of assertion, not attraction. give your attention to what you want to find (the solution), rather than the obstacles (the problem).

every science theory has to prove itself to be believed to be true. once believed, that's how how it expected and believed to be, and so now we live in that paradigm. science theories will always match the philosophy
