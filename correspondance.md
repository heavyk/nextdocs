### 2021-11-06 - senet

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__DoZXO-seM)

have you read chapter 24 in "understanding media" by marshall mcluhan? it's dense reading, but he basically explains how games sort of encode the mentality of the culture of their origin.

so thinking about that, I was noticing how the game of senet encodes this idea that you need to be "lucy" or favoured by the gods to win the game. you have to throw the correct number of moves in order to win. if you don't, there are a number of hazards that will keep you stuck or forever having to go back and start over.

if you're lucky to throw the right numbers, you get granted entrance into the afterlife. if not you're forever going to go back and try again.

one could imagine that for the really competitive, it was a huge pissing contest to be the luckiest -- probably lots of good luck charms, incantations, curses (to set your opponent back) -- and maybe for the really competitive, illusions and power plays (to establish one's dominance)...

we only have the game left, but it would be interesting to go back in a time machine and watch a competitve game.

### 2021-12-07 - message to dr. strong about sun heating the night

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouXwNSnuGXc)

hi dr. strong,

a peculiar thing happened when that m-class flare happened. it was night time here where I live and the night suddenly got very warm and the temperature rose from 28F to 59F when it happened at around 4am here. I was awake when it happened and was surprised at how crisp and warm the night was (reminded me of a summer night).

https://www.windy.com/station/ad-KPUB?38.289,-104.497,8

there's the temperature graph for me. looking over to where you're at, the effect didn't seem to be so much: https://www.windy.com/station/madis-AR511?41.544,-72.437,8

however, up in wyoming and other places, it appears they had warmer weather for the whole duration of the outburst: https://www.windy.com/station/ad-KRKS?39.525,-108.211,6

it appears that this warming of the weather happened all across the united states, but less prominantly on the coasts. here's ohio for example: https://www.windy.com/station/ad-KFDY?32.424,-92.180,5

---

I know you said in your global warming video that the solar flares has even a negative effect on warming (less irradiance), but it was night time so that's zero irradiance and yet it warmed up quite a lot. is there any way to explain this phenomena? is it well known? surely I'm not the only one that has noticed this...

anyway, thanks for everything,
kenny

### 2021-12-07 - letter to michael and anastasia

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Smt0sDLOWQ)

this was a very difficult interview to listen to. through the whole thing, not once did he actually talk about how electric current works. the entire time was spent with him trying to be right and his theory (which was never mentioned) accepted. the few times that he began to actually talk about it, he was interrupted with silly things like "define energy before you continue" or "explain what the sun is emitting". there were no attempts to even try to figure out what he was saying. it seemed to me like he's trying to say that it's not the electrons that are moving but the opposite charge -- so protons -- I guess.

I guess the weird thing for me is that you guys were not allowing him to actually begin to brainstorm out his idea by constantly forcing definitions and name dropping -- which is nearly the same thing that mainstream science is doing. law of attraction must be true in that you are becoming the thing you're giving your attention to (fighting against).

the covid economic advisors joke was funny though...

instead of listening to a 2h argument, it would be nice to hear a brainstorming on how to explain the person's theory without any name dropping or big worded concepts. I think it would be fine to be loose with definitions until a concept is established. "energy" is good enough. it doesn't need to fit into an atom.

a thought is a form of energy, but can you locate the atoms which compose it? likewise, a wave in the pool is energy, but neither can you say that this group of water molecules in the pool contains the energy of that wave, or does the pool contain the energy? if energy is movement, then we're not talking about the rails, but the train.

---

I've given this concept a lot of thought and I've come around to thinking of protons (aten, or whatever it is you call the stuff coming from the sun) being the fundamental form of electricity for quite a while now. however, the problem is that it would appear to me that these protons are something of physical manifestations of consciousness. that consciousness is vibrating and would appear to us as light. the "problem" with this theory though is that it means that consciousness is imbued into everything, neutrons don't exist (they're just electron and proton pairs), and that our sun is composed 100% of protons, when then affects the electron pairs and these interactions produce all of the elements.

obviously that theory sounds a bit nuts and I have no way to prove it (nor do I ever intend to do so. it's just fun to think about). I really think science is a form of philosophy, and going back to law of attraction for a moment: consider that if, your philosophy is formed in such a way where you believe that "all is matter". now, when conducting your experiment, you construct it in such a way to prove your hypothesis. are also the observer of your own experiments too, so those experiments will have to "prove" your philosophy that everything is matter. it's very unlikely that a scientist will get unexpected/unexplained results and come to the conclusion their philosophy is wrong.

likewise, if I have a philosophy that everything is a manifestation of consciousness (eg. what you attract by giving your attention to it), then again I am the observer to my own experiments and my consciousness will "prove" my own beliefs to be right.

I really wouldn't wait for science to change their philosophy. if you need someone to change, that's law of assertion, not attraction. give your attention to what you want to find (the solution), rather than the obstacles (the problem).

every science theory has to prove itself to be believed to be true. once believed, that's how how it expected and believed to be, and so now we live in that paradigm. science theories will always match the philosophy

### 2021-12-07 14:21 - book of revelation reveal

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2qvBPfhxf0)

hey matthew, great show.

so, I watched that moses thing episode that you mentioned like you suggested and I had totally not realised that my intuition about "moses" was spelled out so plainly in the torah. I have further theories on that subject regarding akhenaten and elijah as well...

anyway, after that it was really weird because I stumbled on to another place in the bible where it says very plainly what it's talking about but people have clearly not seen it (personally I've read this at least dozens of times)... it's revelation 17. let's start with the instructions to translate this:

15 And he saith unto me, “The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples and multitudes, and nations and tongues.

18 And the woman whom thou sawest is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth.”

this great city without a doubt is rome -- the babylon that sacked the second temple. clearly, this is talking about the holy roman empire (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_L4_LmqImY for further evidence).

so, now let's do the replacements:

---

And there came one of the seven angels, who had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, “Come hither; I will show unto thee the judgment upon the [holy roman empire who presides over the people and communications of the earth],

2 with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication [with the holy roman empire], and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of [the holy roman empire's] fornication.”

3 So he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness; and I saw [holy roman empire] sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, and having seven heads and ten horns [-- the "antichrist"].

4 And the [holy roman empire] was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and bedecked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication;

5 and upon her forehead was a name written: Mystery, Babylon the Great, Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth.

6 And I saw that the [holy roman empire] was drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw [the holy roman empire], I wondered with great amazement.

7 And the angel said unto me, “Why dost thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the [holy roman empire] and of the [antichrist] that [rides on the back of the holy roman empire], which hath the seven heads and ten horns.

8 The [antichrist] that thou sawest was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition; and they that dwell on the earth, whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, shall wonder when they behold the [antichrist] that was, and is not, and yet is.

9 “And here is the mind which hath wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the [holy roman empire] sitteth.

[I consider these "mountains" to be seven planes of existence which in rev 13 are the 7 heads or 7 eyes of zech 3,4 and rev 5. so this is a full consciousness enlightenment experience to up to 6d (I can explain this if you want me to). inotherwords, it's saying that the holy roman empire is riding on the back of the perception of this beast/antichrist]

10 And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other has not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.

[likely a reference to the five "root races", coined by blavatsky, with the aquarian root race soon to emerge]

11 And the [antichrist] that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, yet is one of the seven and goeth into perdition.

[this is really weird wording because there's rev 1:8: '“I Am Alpha And Omega, The Beginning And The Ending,” saith the Lord, *who is, and who was, and who is to come*, the Almighty.' (eg. everything past, present and future) -- yet this antichrist is the "all that is *not*, was, and is to come" (eg. everything past, not present, and future) -- so like the negative aspect of the alpha and omega.]

12 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet, but will receive power as kings for one hour with the beast.

[so you have a serpent beast that divides his kingdom into 10 peices. this is verbaitem plato's atlantis. just replace beast with posiedon.]

13 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.

[after 5d consciousness is attained, you are liberated to perceive yourself conceptually from any position from within the creation that you're tuned to. as an example in your body if you focus your attention to your lungs, you perceive from the perspective of your lungs. if you are the planet and your lungs is a person, and your heart is another person, they are of the same mind, from the perspective of the person. this is saying that the "beast" is the planet itself, and those that are harmonious to that frequency are aspects of the same mind just like your lungs and heart knows what to do without you needing to tell them to pump blood or breathe.]

[problem with this, is that privacy and separation is no longer a thing. we are legion. those that want separation will need a saviour from that harmonious form of perception.]

14 These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them; for He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and they that are with Him are called, and chosen, and faithful.”

[energies will continue to increase and reality will be created in the individual's own perception. some see theirselves as called, chosen (you gatta earn it) and faithful to the king of kings.]

[make your own reality, right? if you collapse your own wave function of reality and you need a saviour, you *will* perceive where the great deceiver is defeated. in their perspective, the eagle will defeat the serpent.]

16 And the ten [parts of the beast's divided empire], these shall hate the [holy roman empire], and shall make [the holy roman empire] desolate and naked, and shall eat [consume the] flesh [of the holy roman empire] and burn [the holy roman empire] with fire.

[eg. emperor without clothes]

17 For God hath put into their hearts to fulfill His will and to agree, and to give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.

[you are "God" in physical form. let's rewrite that from the perspective of the antichrist: For [the consciousness within you] hath put into [your own] heart to fulfill [your own perception of what you've agreed/attracted to be your reality], and to give [over the power to something outside of yourself], until [your own concepts of reality] shall be fulfilled[/manifested].]

---

I added a lot of extra commentary there because the writer clearly intended this vision to be read from as a commentary of the destruction of the oppressive holy roman empire, however because of the symbolic nature of the way it's written, for many people this this speaks of a still future punishment of the holy roman empire by this "antichrist".

in this episode, you guys brought up a lot of good points about this battle between good and evil, light and dark, serpent vs eagle, etc. and that's fine. that is perceiving things with the knowledge of good and evil (most people ar e oblivious). however, see this instead from the perspective of the cycles of all life. if I were enki, I wouldn't want to interfere with the humans. I would consider it like a genetic algorithm. the fitness function measures the fitness of the human based on the capacity the person has to collapse their wave function the way they want. there infinite solutions to this, obviously some technological and some perceptual. if you're making your own reality you don't need a saviour.

final thing: considering the root races in verse 11: it states that the eighth and IMO final root race is the antichrist. so inotherwords, the future is for all people on this planet to become someone who does not need a saviour. that's the whole point. if the great dragon of old who deceived humankind is the creator, we're made in that image -- and, there are infinite paths to realise that.

### 2021-12-09 13:47 - to be or not to be

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yblIgxxeMN8)

regarding the "to be or not to be" question, I have some ideas, but before I want to establish some context.

in spanish and latin, the verb "to be" is a very weird thing. I'm most familiar with spanish so I'll use that. there is a big difference between "ser" and "estar". this difference is most pronounced with emotions. in english, you "are" angry, while in spanish (and I think latin too), have the state of enfadado. english really confuses the difference between "I am" "I have" and "I feel". another weird example is "tengo hambre" vs "I am hungry". if you were to say "soy hambre" that's just really weird becasuse you are never a feeling. neither would you ever say "soy eenfadado" or "soy enfadamiento" (lol).

so right away you have this conflict that arisis between the verb "to be" (ser) and the verb "to be" (estar). they are not the same. you are not your emotions in latin/spanish, but in english, you are your emotions.

---

the next connection that I saw was the connection that "to be or not to be" has, is with the concept of the "alpha and the omega" or aleph/tav in hebrew. so the tav (cross) is a symbol for the "last" (rather than the first).

the main place where the alpha/omega symbolism is found in the NT is in in the book of revelation, yet I would contend that it's also found in john 1. I'm going to focus on revelation though because right there it says:

Rev 1:8 “I Am Alpha And Omega, The Beginning And The Ending,” saith the Lord, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.

the key part there is the "who is, and who was" part. because this is nearly the same wording found in rev 17 about the beast:

Rev 17:8 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition; and they that dwell on the earth, whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, shall wonder when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.

notice that it calls the beast the "was, and is not". it's almost like it's saying that the alpha "is" (to be), and the omega "is not" (not to be).

that could just be a coincidence. I thought the chapter numbers were weird, and it seems like the numbers of the book of revelation have been heavily massaged to get certain things in certain places. I looked in the 1611 version and the only thing out of place I noticed is that the bottom of rev 17 has the word "where" and the next page has "wherefore". I don't think it's anything though.

---

so it's probably a bit of a stretch for some to make the correlation of the beast being written about in similar form to the alpha and omega, but now, let's look to see what the beast really is. that book tells us plainly what the whore is -- it's basically the holy roman empire, and the holy roman empire is riding on the back of this beast. it's connected to the peoples and languages and tounges (communication media) and the people are intoxicated with the sexual deeds of the holy roman empire. I'll let you use your imagination on what that could mean, and if the holy roman empire still exists today. either way, tbis empire relies on the beast for some reason to control the world's communications.

the part about the communications is the important part because all of this is talking about how we interact with each other and communicate in language. the language itself determines what you can be and what you cannot be. the language has a dramatic influence on how you perceive emotion (do you have rage or *are* you rage?).

---

the last thing I want to point out is that the first mention of the beast is actually in rev 13. it's described in the same way as having 7 heads and ten horns/crowns. that same imagery is also used in rev 12 do describe the serpent of old which deceived humankind (in the garden of eden). it's said that that the dragon empowered the beast.

so the dragon is related to connected to the beast in some way, empowering it. the beast must be a construct or a technology that enables the holy roman empire to control nations and languages. some sort of technology. some sort of communication network.

this description comes right after the "two witnesses" in rev 11, which I believe is the "twice eleven brethren". they are the two pillars, the two lampstands, and are symboically related to moses and elijah.

Rev 11:11 But after three days and a half, the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fellupon them that saw them.

this symbolism is very similar to the lazarus symbolism. after 4 days, jesus went to resurrect lazarus from the tomb. I believe that jesus was resurrecting a concept from 4kya back in the age of taurus.

I first noticed this was the case because there is a definite distinction between "he" (physical) and "hee" (spiritual/conceptual) that the editor of the new testament makes between these two. it seems very much on purpose.

in this way, I consider that the two witnesses (twice eleven brethren) are resurrecting a *concept* that died 3.5kya. this is roughly the age of moses and the egyptian 18th dynasty.

---

the way I see it, there is an initial implementation of a concept (stone) that happens (this is the alpha), but then it gets corrupted/rejected by an organisation that prevents it. because the concept is ahead of its time, it has to go underground and be preserved by the people who believe in the concept. later on, enough desire to have that concept realised eventually attracts the destroyer of the system which prevents that concept (the omega).

so now in rev 17:12-16 it talks about how there are 10 kingdoms which will receive power (presumably from the beast) and lay the old system (holy roman empire) desolate and naked. however after revealing her secrets and leaving her upended, the alpha comes in and defeats them and establishes a new system.  remember, the alpha is the one that *is*, and the omega is now the one that *is not*.

---

I believe this to be or not to be is a sort of: pick your side: are you the one that is (alpha), or the one that is not (omega).

the alpha is the first but it'll ultimately rejected by the people and have to go into secrecy to preserve the concepts. the omega is the last and it resurrects the alpha, but is gets defeated right after by the next alpha.

### 2021-12-10 12:58 - to be or not to be (part two)

```
My idea about it is highly speculative. I'm not sure about making a video, so I'll try to explain here.
It's more based on the homophonic value of TO BE being 22. The words are TO BE, OR NOT, TO BE.
Consider that the TO BE's are equivalent to 22/crucifixes/crosses.
Now, focus on OR NOT and the two commas.
We get the round letter 'O' from the Phoenician AYIN, which was drawn that way to represent an eye.
Commas also resemble the Hebrew character, YODH ( I ). I thought it might be a clue that "EYE" and the letter "I" are homophones.
If the two O's (AYIN/EYE) in OR NOT are switched with the two commas, or YODH's / I's (O/AYIN/EYE for the letter "I"), the letters OR NOT become IR NIT.
TO BE OR NOT TO BE would be  22  IR NIT  22.
If TO BE/22's a cross, then the translation would be  T  IR NIT  T.
Now read that like Hebrew, right to left:
T   T INRI   T.
It's Golgotha, with Jesus (INRI) and his cross in the middle, and the crosses of the two thieves on the left and right.
You seem very familiar with the Bible, so I'm sure you know all about "taking up one's cross."
Could TO BE, OR NOT, TO BE be a reminder to the Brethren of the choice one makes, everyday, to take up one's cross and follow Christ.
Simply put, the Cross or not the Cross.
Like I said, highly speculative.
```

I think you're on the right track there... the main point I was making last message there is that tav = 22 = cross, so what you say seems perfectly logical. I may have something to add here.

you mentioned the taking up the cross thing (mat 16:24). matthew groups the text into sections that are logically similar, so the context is important. three verses prior (16:21), jesus announces his death and ressurection -- so we're already talking about an ending (cross) and a beginning (resurrection). the following chapter (17) is the transfiguration.

I have more to say about the transfiguration, but it's important to note that the resurrection happens after 3 days and the transfiguration happens after 6 days. for this reason, I believe that these are cosmic events. anyway, in the transfiguraton, two appear with him, moses and elijah. so, we have three characters here. the sun, the prophet and the law. I wonder if these are the three T's, and vere was considering himself to be the 4th T. the other thing to note is that in mat 11, it identifies john the baptist with elijah. john the baptist taps out (cross) so that jesus can go.

this is a common theme in storytelling where there are two and one sacrifices so that the other can go this produces a third thing. these are the hero twins, gemini twins, john the baptist and jesus, etc. when the immortal twin returns, he resurrects the mortal twin. I believe this is the lazarus reference. the significance of both the resurrection after 3 days, and the transfiguration after 6 days is that he's fortelling that there will be future instances of this sacrifice (cross) and resurrection of the thing that died.

---

I don't know vere's life super well, but what I do know is that he completely changed how we define ourselves. the verb "to be" is like I said a very convoluted verb having the definition of oneself (I am smart), the emotional state (I am frustrated), and the possession of things (tengo hambre). I believe the shakespearean plays completely redefined how we utilise emotion in cases of comedy and tragedy. I am/embody the emotion now. I define myself with my emotion. it's not just a state of being or something I have.

when I read really old stuff, there is a lot of separation -- your majesty the most graceful and merciful, etc. these are descriptions of a person. now, we *are* the emotion that we feel. now, I *am* angry.

humans learn how to react to things by watching others react to things. I can't tell you how times were before the shakespeare plays started to codify our reactions to comedy and tragedy, but I know for certain people processed emotion differently. the shakespeare plays taught us a new set of reactions to emotions.

likewise, the 1611 KJV bible completely redefined the way that people processed their connection to the divine. at what cost though?

---

the concept behind the omega/tav/cross symbol is that it terminates the old system and creates a new system. the new system is ultimately rejected by the people because it's too far ahead of its time. not everyone can see the value in the new concept, so its marginalised and kept in secret until the profane masses are capable of adopting it.

the important part to understand is that you're only ever fighting your own perception, so the rejector of the new system is ultimately a reflection of the omega's own faulty perception.

in this context, vere is only fighting against his own beliefs of what it is to be a king. him being a king is too far ahead of its time. his own perception prevents him from becoming it.

to understand this, consider the verse about taking up one's cross:

24 Then Jesus told his disciples, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
25 For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.

when one percieves a new system, one usually only perceives the positive aspects of it. these positive aspects often contain all sorts of amazing things that are clearly an upgrade to the present system (in the creator's eyes). however, this will go against the present system's objectives. the system must maintain it's control so it has to find a way to shut down the new creation and end it (cross). the present system kills the new system to try and save its own life. however, that system eventually loses its life.

instead, take up your cross and deny yourself, because ultimately if you're not focused on preservation of your (physical) life, you find your spiritual life/perception.

I belive vere had an idea for society that he wanted to create which revolves around perception (like literally seeing better). this is directly linked to the female bloodline, as it's sexual interaction with these females that allows for this expanded perception (and her progeny) which is why I think that his interaction with the queen was so important.

that whole time around the renaissance there was a lot of cathedral building going on. depending on who you talk to, you will begin to see a theme that sacred geometry (like the one in the pyramid or solomon's temple) has a dramatic effect on the well-being and perceptive capability of the person. to me, it's clear (though it is speculation) that there was an effort to keep ramping up these things allow people greater perception and everyday access to the divine (the same technology that the great pyramid and cathedrals use).

I believe that the writers had access to this expanded (MOAI, IAOM) and used various techniques to enhance their perception, this expansive form of perception is what I believe they used to write the works of shakespeare and encode those things (I call it conceptual/emotional perception) and they worked on these things in a shared mental space.

however, the present system (both then and now) needs the majority of people to remain the ignorant/profane masses. giving the public access to this sort of perception would allow people to begin to pertceive theirselves from a divine perspective, and that would eliminate the need for power structures (like a king and queen) -- therefore, cathedral building and the expansion of the profane masses' consciousness had to stop.

the book, hunchback of notre dame is set around that time period (1482) and captures the essence of the idea of these qualities found in the female and divine proportions will continue to exist in the form of architecture even though there is effort to keep the profane masses from gaining this knowledge.

---

I believe that vere's plan was unable to go through, and so he had to take up his cross and instead follow the light (christ). it says it right there, that whoever loses his life will in fact find it. that's a convoluted way of saying that the end of something is also the beginning of another. it really depends on the way you perceive the ending. sure the perfect manifestation that was originally desired does not come out (deny yourself), but if you just stick to it, you find out that it comes out in the end.

vere is talking about how he is the 4th T and I think he really believes himself to have made one of those sacrificies. in his mind, he is the 4th T.

sure, it sounds extremely presumptuous (on his part) to think that vere actually believed himself to be right up there with jesus, but that is in fact what jesus says to do in the taking up of the cross. he's saying "be like me". it really is only the disempowering mainstream dribble that tries to keep us from realising this.

I believe that vere had a knowledge that everyone is more than just the physical body you *are* divinity within. he must have known how important the words "I am" are. the verb "to be" is what this is all about. coming from a guy that spent the majority redefining (through the works of shakespeare) how we define ourseleves in terms of our emotion (a transition from having emotion), this sacrifice of the definition of who "I am" is, is expressed in the works of shakspeare. this must be the central axis upon which the whole works revolve around, and only someone that writes, "I am that I am" can understand the importance of the verb "to be" as one's definition of oneself.

---

if you "deny yourself", and take up your cross (let the end come), then you will find that the end is only a transition into a new beginning. this links right into the message of john the baptist. I like to think that he often said, "once you've died, you no longer fear death" -- with the correlary to this that once you are able to give up on the physical manifestation of "I am", then you are able to transcend the physical expression and be reborn into something new.

this is a very difficult concept for most people to think of, but what are you? are you this physical body or are you something more that inhabits physical bodies? this separation must have been very little for someone like vere and so it was his constant struggle to not get so caught up in the injustices of the physical experience. if you know you are not this physical body, consider then reading the sonnets from the perspective that vere is referring to the extra-physical perception of himself as "Time" and notice that he's only fighting against himself...

so, like I said, if you're taking up your cross (omega), then the alpha which defeats you and prevents the establishment of the created system (which has to go underground) is really only a reflection of your own perception. you are your own enemy. you are the alpha and also the omega. you create your own beginning and end cycles.

---

dunno what to do with this, but I find it interesting:
IAM = 22
TOBE = 22
22 THAT 22 (I am that I am)
22 ORNOT 22 (to be or not to be)

the way that I have also seen "I am that I am" is seen both ways:

I am that (external perspective - recognising oneself externally)
that I am (internal perspective - recognising oneself internally)

I'll keep thinking more..

### 2023-01-26 22:50 - ganancias

it'd be cool if you could still vote after the game started, but if you vote the opposite of the winning vote, you get a bonus reward proportional to the odds, inversely proportional to how many previous voters there were (ex. I'm votes 15000-17000/55500, so kinda early on) -- lemme explain.

for example on the "don't count me out game" the 63 - 37, only 37% of the people voted NOP, but anyone in the last 5m there would have probably thought the game was an L, so would have quick voted NOP to gain like a return or bonus calibrated to how far into the vote it is ... meaning like if I vote right before it ends and it's the winning vote, I get back basically the leaves I put in + a tiny tiny bonus -- so no sweat.

this system, if implemented will increaase the number of voters voting because they can always bet safe right before the end.

it's the unexpected results that make a game fun, and rewarding players for unexpected results attracts more unexpected results. more hype, more action.

for, example I voted NOP on that game, I'd be thinking: that tiny bonus is pretty good to keep expanding my leaves. IF I lose my leaves only during a really unexpected turn of events, the emotion of the moment and the clearly justifiedly "lucky" but justified outcome, it feels OK losing my leaves (it's not an unpleasant experience) --  HOWEVER, if I voted YEP -- wow, I get a huge bonus from all of the leaves the quick NOPers jumped in on lost. I believed in thijs!

### 2023-01-27 09:17 - from the spectrum where we are (consciousness)

hi russ,

I just got done listening to the last show with marty and seriah. I feel inspired to try and "simplify" the show (and this message) into a single word: novel. now, allow me a moment to oversimplify...

imagine a narrative: a sequence of symbols that progress in clumps of symbolic apparance (eras/acts). the sequence of symbols in these periods/eras is what appears to push us forward in our perception of the past. (we drive forward into the future looking into the rear-view mirror of our concept of how we got here: history). this is the "forward" force.

there is also a "backward" force too but first notice that the forward/backward duality manifests in government/religion, as progress/congress, ahriman/angriman, etc.

the "backward" force is our own conceptual reflection of the narrative. we perceive the reflection of this narrative through our concept of what is "real" and then manifest our concept of this narrative into the spiritual/conceptual world (of ideas/form), which passes into our perception/imagination of it (we can only see things in our imagination that we believe, so this is why the same spiritual entity can look the same to different people) -- and then sometimes, if the emotional/conceptual charge (ie how "real" it feels) is enough to believe it (this is real), we then   manifest it into the physical as a nuts and bolts tangible, physical thing. sometimes it doesn't make it all the way into physical only manifesting as our best interpreation/perception of the conecept/idea/symbol/archetype (depending which angle you look at the concept), which are just higher frequency, meaning invisible to us, vibrations.

now, let's look at the impact/result of the forward/ahriman, backward/angriman, and our own concepts/beliefs (conceptualisation) triad (what makes a plane/dimension): see it? the energy/vibration produced from this intersection cascades down like a fractal resonaance through what we call "time" -- and then *we* (consciousness) manifest that vibration by giving energy/focus/attention to it. that energy from the triad of conecpts interacts with other (existing) slower and slower vibrations all the way down through the spiritual/conceptual, sometimes making it down to the imagination/perceptual (if our brain didn't filter it out), and even further sometimes down into the physical (when it's belivable enough).

let's contemlate now how the most "static" stuff, is actually the most dynamic: existing vibrations, like the stable isotopes composing large rocks and megalithic structures, are the least affected by this narrative playing out over time because harmonics affect higher frequency ones more, so they stay pretty stable, only occasionally losing alignment/harmony (perpetuation) with the high frequency galactic signal/concept that sustains them and decay. however, also note that the big rocks and megaliths are a manifestation of the reflection of our concept of that narrative, so they were/are created in an instant every instant by our collective concept of why those static structures need to be there for the era's symbols to be understandable (make sense). everything outside is an externalisation of ourselves.

for example, let's say the narrative has a sharp decline from high society/technology/society/perception, and then a rapid and much more exciting return back to remembering who "I am" is (you are a reflection of your perception/narrative/concept of yourself). therefore, we find evidence of a destruction of atlantis, sea level rise, destroyed megaliths, gods, angels, demons, etc. we create everything we see each moment as a reflection of how we conceptualise the symbols in the narrative. this is "reality" and it's the way we expect it to be.

---

we manifest the narrative into being. the narrative each individual experiences presently, is *always* going to be the individual's concept of the most exciting/novel reality for theirself (relative to their frame of reference). so, for example -- if I'm a banker, I'm a banker because that's the most I can imagine myself to be "good enough" to experience anything greater, and so I'm living the most exciting/novel life/narrative I can allow myself to experience within the context of my character/soul's concept of itself.

we live in a self-narrated and self-rewriting narrative reality of self-similar self-referential (harmonics) of symbol sequences. each era, has its repeating set of symbols in its sequence, which is the symbolic (non-physical) opposite of our conceptualisation of what happened physically in the previous era. we create the new era when we've finally understood (able to understand/perceive) who/when/what/where "I am" is -- which is who the individual *really* is and what makes the *individual* decidedly different from other self-referencing clumps of consciousness.

I believe that about sums up the last show. please give me your corrections so I can confirm that I'm right about my wrongness.

final thought: ignorance is bliss, right? well, so is understanding: from an emotional perspective they feel the same, but viewed from complete opposite viewports. as a simile to opposite ends of the spectrum being the same concept from opposite perspectives -- allow me to consider the possibility that my being wrong about being wrong all the time is the same as my being right about being right all the time.

another final thought: we consider vibration to have a forward/back, left/right, and up/down motion to it. do you suppose there are other dimensions than just those three, or do you think they are only apparent?

this simplification is a bit novel at this point (few pages on my screen), so I'd like to reserve a time in the future to talk about my theories (which I'm inevitably somewhat wrong about) on how triads and the symbols that we create for this narrative structure appears to us as consciousness.

### 2023-01-27 23:00 - ro ki

6:18 - when you're reading ro ki, an image appears in my brain of helen/diana/eve as explained by alan in the conclusion of the fisher kings act 2: https://youtu.be/0_9TyxAmwDQ?list=PLIe_MWXIGGHRsJo2tsg2nIGD31OudT1q1&t=1034

the idea here is that the siege of troy by the trojan horse is what forced a change in many power structures (kicked out of eden/troy), and that started a new era. this is obviously pointing to what happened with bacon's "new atlantis". well, ki is the earth as in en-ki (lord of the earth), right, so when you're saying "ro ki", I can clearly see the rose as hellen and ki as troy. in addition to that tau/cross is also a symbol of the earth, so ki being a reference to earth also works there too. my intinct says that this is the south pole (rose) of earth, the domain of lord chronos (Time).

---

also, I'd like to mention that in hamlet one of the characters is four-ten-brasse. the word brasse has references to de vere, and so does brasse. looking there might strengthen your "fortis" argument. I know there's something to the "brasse" thing, but I haven't figured it out yet. well, what comes to mind right now is the dream where daniel sees a statue made of material, one being brass. dunno if it's anything.

pilce (eclip backwards) is apparently a place in poland (probably where for-ten-brasse is going to conquer).

https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilce
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortinbras

### 2023-01-28 00:29 - another TT

6:18 - there is another TT I think you may have missed. 121 has T, and so does 122. 121 is 11x11, so this shows me that 121 is also a TT code.

in addition to this 121 reads "T IS". so, if we have the other 3 T's and put them together, it reads "TT" and "T IS" which clearly spells FORTIS (which, of course is located on top of 'W'). however, that's only 3 Ts. I know because of the 11x11 there's a 4th in there somewhere -- so, where is the 4th T? (I don't actually know. I'm just saying it looks like a clue to me)

18:58 - also notice the "Or" looks pretty much like a "CT" to me. C+T is 22, and 9+1+0=1 so you can see the sequence in reverse now: 122. 18. 122. -- seems significant to me.

now, after thinking about it, my intuition tells me that the 4th T is probably "taurus mountain", ie the great pyramid, which is also the cross of the earth. (which is in cai-ro)

### 2023-02-02 08:42 - vere and bacon

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/ye5JCbg1h00)

I notied another one: 8:48
- in the last paragraph, count 11 words before "rose" is the word "crosses".
- in the middle paragraph the word "reproose" (it looks to me like rose), and count 11 words before it is "VVitch". notice how both words are partial: "VV" on one and "roose" (rose) on the other.

---

in addition to that, the colours red and white are mentioned numerous times. in rape of lucrece, it is lilly pale (white) and red rose. in venus and adonis, it's "More white, and red, than doues, or roses are". I know that white and red also shows up in turtle and phoenix and a number of other places. considering the english flag at the time (a red cross on white), this is another reference to red/rose cross.

6:56 - also notice the that you're talking about the ark of the covenant and solomon's (who is said to have had 1000 loves) "temple" and the "ark" (which we all know is the Rose). anyway, the line right below (17th line), it says, "A thousand honie secrets shalt thou know:". the 18th line has serpent (S) in it and H -- but I don't see a "T" on line 19.

finally I'd like to note that my theory of why the initials of francis bacon are on the rape of lucrece is because it reads like vere being woo'd by francis. when I read it, it's like readying a testimony of something that he thought would be awful, but it turned out to be not what was expected. vere was probably the "golden ass" (nick bottom), and francis was let's say the "motor".

I can really feel it when bacon says: "VVhere thou with patience, must my will abide" ("will" = "pen") followed by the lines where bacon says: "My will that marks thee for my earth's delight" (notice how he writes it like he (saturn/bacon) owns the world), then "VVitch I to conquer sought with all my might". now, the instructions to maintain secrecy and not to listen/heed friends: "But, VVill is deaf and hears no heedful friends" -- however, to me this concept comes through with two voices: on bacon's voice sounds like instructions, but in vere's voice, this is him accepting of the shameful situation and disregarding of scorn and advice from "friends".

there's another thing that I'd like to mention in regards to this: there is a common triad appearing of venus, vulcan/zarathustra/ganymede and mars/aries/ariel that shows up over and over. the other triad that shows up is venus, adonis/saturn/Time, and mercury/Speed. when I look at the concepts for them, I consider that vere is eqating himself with venus and, bacon with adonis/saturn/Time.

24:57 - notice FB is on top in the first sonnet and VV is on bottom... just sayin...

### 2023-02-02 14:22 - video 42

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/goW0-zrXoK0)

8:40 - for me this jumps out as: "TH e ver" -- same result, just he' s identifying himself with TH on the 4th T.

24:11 - I know this is well after de vere's death, but it's worth pointing out that the first grand lodge was established on 6/24/1717: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Freemasonry#First_Grand_Lodge

24:54 - "The Cloud cupt Towers": probably the towers of babel(yn), "The Gorgeous Palaces" (of babylon) "The Solemn Temples" (of solomon), and now (where we are now, in the 4th T), "The Great Globe itself". the idea of "all which it Inherit, Shall Disolve; and like the baseles Fabrick of a Vision Leae not a wreck behind" -- this scroll (which john ate) is the progression of the visual narrative that we're immersed into. notice that it's notably "aryan" (babylon and jewish) -- and that the ending there is notably similar to the end of "as you like it".

in another comment I talked about the two triads where the name venus is used in common. the first (aryan) triad is vulcan/ganymede/zarathustra, mars/aries, and venus/ishtar/astarte.

the second triad being played out in the shakespere narrative is is venus (queen hera/elizabeth, diana, de vere, lucrece, solomon), saturn/adonis/Time (bacon), and thoth/hermes/mercury/Speed (ion dee).

what appears obvious to me now is that there is a reversal of roles playing out here. the saturnian triad starts out with the venus and adonis and rape of lucres, and ends with the tempest and "as you like it". the tempest tells the narrative of de vere being visited by the fairy ariel (mars/aries), and his magickal powers gave de vere the gift of words. at the end of the tempest which is the new imperial age (coming soon -- notice the pirates in gentlemen of verona), prospero/vere lets ariel go. note here that the "occidental star" is "behind aries" -- meaning that vere switched roles with aries. this is then transfered outward to "silvius" (sylvia in gentlemen of verona), through rosalind/ganymede (lind is nice or beautiful in spanish -- so, "nice rose")

what I believe the T is standing for is "taurus", as in the taurus that mithra/mars slays in the secret society narrative (like moses in the exodus with the golden calf), each time associated with a lamb or ram (aries). 1740 makes the next slaying of the taurus possible with the dramatic changes that shakespere's works had on social and cultural perspective of minority groups like females and homosexuals. he's like the transformer of energies through narrative from the saturnian to aryan triad, by playing the double role.

31:06 - ki is the symbol for earth. it's also worth noting that aphrodite/venus/helen is associated with eve and the earth. the idea here is that the enlighenment of the world is a time when "the book is opened" and no longer do things need to continue to be kept a secret. that time is rapidly approaching. it's associated with the garden of eden when adam and eve's eyes were opened. the renaissance was a time that such a time of enlightening too, but for reasons far too lengthy to explain here, we took a different (narrative) path, and the ambitions of 1740 ("The Great Globe itself") got delayed a bit. they'll probably get delayed again, as I would expect a 5th T as well.

on that note, I would like to say that your videos and alan green's (found you through him), I'm convinced that vere is the 4th T, but obviously his plans got foiled, and so instead of being upset about it, he turned it into a narrative. I believe that even the name "IAM-bic pentameter" is a reference to the idea that he believes there is a coming 5th T, which is the state of G where we are all equal in our self-identity: "I AM". I've been looking for other clues as to what he thinks the 5th T will be, but if the others are the legs and arms, the 5th is the head/crown.

(btw dude you're videos are super awesome!! I'm still working my way through video 45 now, as you suggested I look at this one halfway through, so sorry of I'm mixing the ark/solomon concepts into this comment. super excellent sleuthing man. you're wildly fascinating)

#### 2023-02-03 00:58 - followup: slaying the taurus

I woke up thinking about this topic heavily, and since then I've let all those thoughts die down, and now I'm gonna start from the top, explaining what I think the shakespere narrative is. I believe the narrative is all explained in "hamlet" but you have to not see it as a tragedy (lol, it is quite the bloodbath).

I figure old king hamlet is the 3T, and his wife gertrude is the female bloodline of jesus (of which queen elizabeth was the last). claudius represents the holy roman empire (HRE) and so quickly after 3T's death, gertrude (which I'll call 3F) quickly joins the HRE and young hamlet (4T) is left to try and pick up the pieces. 3T haunts 4T and tries to get 4T to avenge 3T's death by destroying the HRE. I'd also like to note that there is a lot of equating the HRE with taurus/bull symbolism. destroying the HRE would be the objective of mithras, for the HRE having scuffed the last opportunity for FIAT LVX. (I'd like to point out papal bulls, and the number of roman's featured as the villians in shakespere's plays + the uprise in prodestantism).

I'd also like to interject another strange coincidence: which is that the roman goddess "venus" is used to both describe ishtar/astarte/aphrodite/diana (notice the progression of her publicity campaign over the years, btw), and also the venus we now typically equate with athena/minerva (the one that came out of the eye of jupiter/ra fully grown and armed). as I mentioned, this venus conflation by the romans made for quite an interesting link between the aryan and saturian triads. aphrodite is earth and athena is the planet we call venus. I'm noticing that the greeks did not have such a conflation, looking at homer's illiad. the roman poet virgil even equates diana, eve, and helen together.

anyway, 4T keeps delaying and can't seem to bring himself to murder the HRE in revenge for his father, and that brings about a tragedy. as a parallel to the old/young hamlet, there is old/young norway. the name four-ten-brasse is clearly also referring to vere, so to avoid confusion I'll call them 3X and 4X cause they mirror the 3T/4T hamlets, so cause they should be seen as one, I'll say 3TX and 4TX to refer to their composite. notice that 3X peaces out but there's a new 4X that is emerging on to the scene, and he passes through the tribe of dan on his way to pole-land. I have a lot more to say about that, but but I'll keep this brief.

now, I'd like to give my perspective on this, which is that I don't believe there is need to slay another taurus. the HRE and the many transformations the roman empire has gone though since, isn't really necessary to destroy from my perspective. interesting, OK. talk later.

### 2023-02-02 14:58 - video 45

15:36 - I think these may even be sonnet references...

sonnet 17 has "B 4" in it, and is clearly this is talking about the great pyramid.

VVHo will beleeue my verſe in time to come,
If it were fild with your moſt high deſerts?
                 B 4                 Though
(next page)
Though yet heauen knowes it is but as a tombe
Which hides your life , and ſhewes not halfe your parts:

---

sonnet 23 has reference to "book" (and also gold/ore):

Ore-charg'd with burthen of mine owne loues might:
O let my books be then the eloquence,

"book" is probably where the rose is found...
ref: your bit on "To the Reader." in video 42 (https://youtu.be/goW0-zrXoK0?t=42)
tells you to look in his "Booke" (also notice there, that brasse is referring to, four-ten-brasse of hamlet).
ben jonson also praises shakespere's "Booke", also seen in video 42: https://youtu.be/goW0-zrXoK0?t=369

---

finally, sonnet 31 has a "C 3" in the middle of it and is talking about hidden things in graves (also notice the catchword doesn't actually match the next page):

As intereſt of the dead,which now appeare,
But things remou'd that hidden in there lie.
                  C 3             To
(next page)
Thou art the graue where buried loue doth liue,

---

the last sonnet page has ~4 lines till "FINIS.", followed by ~11 lines until "K A". I don't see what "C 3" is reffering To, but "B 4" is probably "BA" to compliment the "KA" and the "KI".

---

I'd also like to add that in the dedication in KJV, it's talking about the "occidental stare" of queen elizabeth. I'd like to point out that "reign" is like "reina", which means "queen", and the occidenttal star. the royal star of the west is "antares" (behind aries) -- and apparently stars (points) are dudes and circles are women. he's making a point here (more dots) so it's referring to *queen* elizabeth (vere), not queen elizabeth I.

(additionally, notice in that dedication he's calling him "Prince IAM-ES" -- the Prince is referenced numerous times by shakespere and is a reference to machiavelli's Prince (see Richard III))

---

32:40 - in the honourable trastise (see fisher kings act 2), it mentions vere has being one of the fisher kings (pisces). in this way, vere is identifying himself with the piscean (silver bow) part of the 3 parts of time, by being one of the fisher kings, which when looking at Rom X, is between offerings of bulls (taurus) and goats (capricorn). notice the offering of bulls there, which can be pretty safely equated with the bulls offered by the HRE, then, the other pillar on the opposite of the triparte time is saturn (goats). now, what do you have between the two pillars? aries, fish (see hamlet; this is the female), and aquaman. this is the progression from lead (actor, prince), silver (reflector, queen) and finally transmuted to gold (character, king) (see merchant of venice).

next, you'll probably notice that the first two (aries and fish) line up just fine with mars and venus, but vulcan/zarathustra is a fire symbol, not a water symbol. to understand the conflation of fire and water, let's look at the final two sonnets, the gemini capstone of the 17 pyramid sonnets (even the name sonnet is small sun). you'll notice the duality of fire and water there. this I beleve is the key to understanding how 4T and 4X are different, but also the same. these are the two gentlemen of verona. one is cupid and the other is proteus. look for a "sovereign cure" soon :)

36:37 - also, the great pyramid is an ever fixed marke (planet's cross) that looks on tempests and is never shaken (has survived cataclysms)

I think both graves and monuments are valid and likely dupilcate or compliment the information found in the other (redundancy). the great pyramid seems to be pointed to in a number of locations, and is also said to be a "tomb" (which it clearly is not).

if the alter is referring to the pink granite "sarcophagus" in in the great pyramid, is an interesting idea to try and remove because it doesn't fit through any opening. neither do we know what the other "half of its parts" look like inside the great pyramid, and neither do we know if there is an altar in there. when I look at the concept though (cause I can't see anything), the concept associated with alter looks to me to be of alter (of alteration), not altar because whatever is there in the middle fire (the alter) flexes and adjusts to pressures from the earth.
