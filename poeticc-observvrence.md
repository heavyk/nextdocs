I like writing here because I get to express my emotional reactions to some ideas. inbetween mind dribble, there are, occasionally some poetic ideas written in there. they take the form of really long lines with a lot of brief but insightful lines, in which their greatnesses, are probably lost because of formatting.

as I was reading john keats' poem today, "Ode to Psyche" -- I wanted to make some edits to it, because afterall he was, and so was his publisher. some of the changes that I wanted to make are so dramatic so as to completely change the meaning (though retain a lot of its feeling). the thing is, when writing poetry, I noticed my brain switched into a whole different form of perception where I was worried about not only the appearance of the words, but how they *sounded* -- most importantly how those sounds made me feel. this is considerably different from how I write normally, which is usually about observations and rants that I have. included below a lot of the surface material are a lot of very insightful things. I've come to learn (from the reactions that I receive), that a sufficiently controversial subject is often the best to work with because the ideas betwixt are kind of like mind viruses. they infect and plague the mind of my reader and I feel the expression of my thoughts is a new dimesion now previously experienced. this, I believe is the pleasure of the poet.

after making a few edits I wanted to know a bit more about the guy and to get to know his backstory because I couldn't explain the ideas that I was feeling. I [watched his documentary](https://youtu.be/xtsZ79kt4Iw) and then with a little bit of wikipedia (so you know it's "right" way to look at it), I think I figured out his life:

he had a somewhat difficult life starting out, but the thing that I felt the most was his mother's estate being taken by a gold digger. there was something with his sister; I think he admired and probably lusted after her too. his sister and mother setup a number of symbols in his life for the identity of women. he setup a lot of ideals, I believe, that, simply put, normal (and mortal) women could not meet. he was the reception of a lot of affection from his male friends and they started to get him into poetry.

I believe somewhere around the time of writing "endymion" he realised the summoning power of poetry and prose, and that started to put him into an idea that he can summon the ideals of his mind into reality. somewhere after that, probably after reading shakesepere, as a reflection of his perception of "claribel" (clara isabella -> clear beautiful isis) he summoned isabella jones (I wonder, btw, if she's related to inigo jones). she seemed to be everything that he wanted, and essentially he'd summoned venus (the consort of saturn).

upon reading the play "bright star" I realised at once that he's talking about venus the morning/evening star, not aphrodite, the earth -- so, in a sense, he's confusing the ideal (venus) with the terrestrial. something else I feel also happened where something that isabella did reminded him of his sister, and so now the ideal is replaced by the terrestrial. her name is fanny (frances) brawn. she has the same name as his sister, and also the name of francis (saturninus), master of the golden ass. notice her name too -- fanny, as in hindsight, and brawn, as in the thing he's not.

he was forever plagued by money, not because he couldn't get a job, but because he loved the lofty feelings that he felt when writing poetry and expressing his ideal desires -- and, of course, that couldn't possibly be accomplished while sawing people open without anesthesia. so, as any ideal poet, musician, or artist will do, he resigned himself to the struggling artist frame of mind. he started to realise and pay the earthly consequences of his summoning -- with the terrestrial reality of his ideals.

the other thing was his struggle for love. because he felt that his ideal women could not be satisfied by a terrestrial women -- this is better explained by example:

noitice the similarity to my life between isabella (patricia) and fanny (raquel). patricia was my ideal women -- you know, she could program, and seemily could tell me things that I didn't know -- and all sorts of things. I only saw my ideal version of her -- and though she would often remind me that she is not ideal, I still liked the ideal version of her in my head. simply put, the person she saw in the mirror is not the same person I saw with my eyes. I was very much to happy to meet the terrestrial version of my ideals (expectations) in raquel, but of course -- my own perceptions brought that to an end in a simlar way. most guys in that kind of situation are then forced to either: go gay and accept men's affections, try and repaint the next girl that shows up as also the ideal, or hold out and simply figure outt what it is that I'm missing in my perception. I thankfully have chosen the ultimate.

the reason, why poetry is such a great summoner of ideas is because it puts the poet into essentially a state of looking only the symbols and concepts present in the poem. if the poem is a favourable one with lofty ideals, the believable parts of those will be manifest into reality, so that the poet can see the (believable) aspects of her ideals manifest. in focusing on those ideas for a length of time, it's an extremely attractive thing, and so the manifestation of that those symbols do happen -- and this is the function of saturn. like 9/11, and the resurrection of lazarus, those symbols can either be a poetic representation (eliciting emotion from the viewer/listener), or it can be reality -- and that reality is only as real as you believe it to be -- much like oliviera's dream-like passage way up to world champion -- that is, until he has to, like someone waking up, try and relive the dream fading so fast, that felt so good just a minute ago.
