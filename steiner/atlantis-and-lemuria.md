# atlantis and lemuria

by rudolf steiner. this book outlines the evolution of humankind as related through his own understanding and in relation to theosophical teachings.

I'm going to write down some of my thoughts in here.

### initiates and the manu

    The world stands under divine guidance; but man should not be forced to acknowledge this fact, but should do so in consequence of the free exercise of his mental capacity. Only when he has attained to this do the Initiates gradually unveil to him their secrets. But this cannot be attained suddenly. Rather is the whole development of the fifth Root-Race a slow path to this goal. At first the Manu himself still led his flock like children, but afterwards the leadership was gradually transferred to human Initiates.

the second half of chapter 3 kinda rubs me the wrong way, and that quote above kinda incapsulates my disdain for the latter half of this chapter.

the first sentence there says that we're under divine guidance, which could mean the same thing as that my fingers are also under divine guidance right now typing this text, if I consider myself divine. they are being guided, I suppose, but no more differently than the first three root-races and first half of the atlantian root-race are guided by the same force that is guiding my fingers right now. you could say that each finger is a "group consciousness" that is being divinely inspired by me to perform the act of typing as the divine ruler (me) is commanding them to do -- but I don't think that's what he's trying to say.

as I read further into that quote, I see now that he's saying that my fingers should not be forced to acknowledge that I'm guiding them -- that is, until they gain enough mental capacity to choose to acknowledge that I am guiding them. obbviously, he's not talking about divine guidance in the way that I'm moving my fingers or that the first 3.5 root-races were guided. instead, he's talking about something else.

this manu guy is a bit of a shepherd in that he is guiding his flock by initiating sub-shepherds to do his shepherding for him. sounds to me like outsourcing.

the goals of the manu are stated here:

    Only at the end of the fifth Root-Race, when, after the progress made in the course of the sixth and seventh sub-races, a sufficiently large number of men will be ready to receive knowledge, the greatest Initiate will be able to reveal himself to them publicly. And this human Initiate will then be able to take over the further general leadership, just as the Manu had done at the end of the fourth Root-Race.

ugh, OK, so I see what he's trying to say here, but I have a few pretty major objections. what it's saying is that at the end of days the "greatest Initiate" (manu) will be able to reveal himself as a divine being and take over leadership positions.

earlier on it said that the manu was the first divine being that appeared in human form. therefore, just believeing this text, it's stating that manu was divinity in human form (of which we all are). so what's the real difference between manu and a normal person? I don't think there is any, honestly, but then again, what is the difference between me and other people? I'd say that my number one defining characteristic is that I don't really believe the "authorities" and I want to figure it out for myself. I'm not sure if that's what manu was, but I doubt it. to illustrate...

    It was the intention of the Manu to direct everything in human life towards the higher worlds. All human action, all arrangements were to bear a religious character.

I don't know what he means by "religious" here, but the feeling it gives me is that one should have a reverance and awe toward anything that is greater than you. this is how you keep someone feeling small and science does it all the time when they say our universe is just so vast and we're like a spec of sand on a beach and other nonsense like that.

    In this way the Manu wished to lead the way to that which constitutes the special task of the fifth Root-Race. This Race was to learn to guide itself onward through its own thoughts.

good...

    Such self-determination, however, can lead to salvation only when man gives his own self also to the service of the higher powers.

terrible! wrong wrong wrong! this is saying that one can only be saved when you give up your power, which is sorta true, but nobody can really save you. I prefer tesla's mom's perspective on this instead:

    She understood the character of men and knew that one's salvation could only be brought about thru his own efforts. One afternoon, I remember, when I had lost all my money and was craving for a game, she came to me with a roll of bills and said, "Go and enjoy yourself. The sooner you lose all we possess the better it will be. I know that you will get over it." She was right. I conquered my passion then and there and only regretted that it had not been a hundred times as strong. I not only vanquished but tore it from my heart so as not to leave even a trace of desire. Ever since that time I have been as indifferent to any form of gambling as to picking teeth.

tesla's mom knows that only tesla can save himself from his desire. tesla then says essentially that one can only save yourself through self-determination. I hold a different perspectivce than tesla in that willpower is not a very effective measure way to get rid of habits for me and it actually has the opposite effect. tesla has willpower and I have feeling/desire, but his mom is correct that each person has to conquer/save theirself. let's get back to steiner's vision of manu:

    The education of the fifth Root-Race has therefore as its aim the production of a larger portion of mankind who shall attain so far as to follow freely a human Manu, just as was done by the nucleus of this fifth race with regard to the divine Manu.

the end result here is that the 5th (aryan) root-race will produce a human manu so that people can follow him. when he says "produce", I think in terms of desire. if humans are looking for someone to follow, then their desire will produce the thing that they're looking for.

the way that I look at it, this is the same force which will produce a "saviour" for people. their desire to have someone to come and save them will either produce more circumstances that they need salvation from, or the saviour that they're looking for (depends on which part absence or presence of the saviour you're looking at[^1]).

in the same way the manu can be seen as a preview saviour figure that is going to build up desire to produce the manifestation of what they want. therefore, I believe that the manu should be looked at in negative form. he's the thing that you think you want, but not what you really want.

an example of this is, let's say you're programming something and you're not familiar with that kind of code, so you wish that someone would just program that part for you. it sounds easy, but *really* you do want to actually know how to program that type of thing, so you don't *really* want to just have someone do it for you. manu just kinda reminds me of a cheap solution (chapuza). therefore, I believe manu is framed as a short-sighted desire where we *think* we want his solution, I just want to give up my power and have someone else do it for me.

that is extremely ironic because steiner began the sentence say

come to think of it, this is likely the reason why there are so many corporations and governments that operate on this principle where they'll do X for you, as long as you give up your power to them. they are in a sense a micro-saviour service they'll save you from your small problem (for a price, of course).

[1]: I'm reminded very strongly of "the medium is the message", but it would instead say, "desire is the message" -- because, manifestation is to desire as content is to the communication medium. it's not important what is on the TV or in the book, just that TV is very different than a book. it's not important whether you're finding yourself in more situations you need to be saved from, or someone saves you from them; what's important is that you're desiring a saviour.

### modern edits

I started to read this document last night and then today I reread a lot of it and noticed some considerable differences. there was a strange rainshower last night at about 1am even though the temperature was still about 80F outiside (very strange). the bananas that were still unripe yesterday also managed to age about 4-5 days time overnight as well.

I remember various parts were changed and there is evidence of this in the version I have here. it seems that the edits have to do with the atlantian's ability to do powerful things (like stonework and things like that).  here is an example:

    Men began to go beyond the simple remembrance of the past, they began to compare their various experiences. The faculty of judgment developed, and wishes and desires were regulated according to this discernment. Man began to calculate, to combine. He learnt to work in thoughts. [...]
    But, while man thus gained thought-power inwardly, his command over the external forces of Nature was being lost. The forces of the mineral kingdom can be controlled only by means of this combining thought, not by the life-power. It was therefore at the cost of the mastery of the life-force that the fifth sub-race developed thought-power.

so we gained combining and comparative thought, and it says that the mineral kingdom (ie. stonework) can be controlled this combining thought, *not* life-power, which doesn't make any sense. he's saying that rocks can be controlled with logical thought rather than life-power which completely contradicts what he says next:

    Now it is no longer possible for thought alone, working entirely within the man, and no longer able to command Nature directly, to bring about such devastating results as did the misused forces of earlier times

if thought (which is what was developed) is no logner able to command nature, then why did he write above that it's this combining thought which could command the mineral kingdom? it's either one or the other; something was edited.

#### responses

I had a few reactions to wondering why I made mention of the rain and the bananas. I've come to associate massive sudden rain storms associated with negative emotion or bad-feeling in a high energy environment (ref: tormenta and marcos, missing 411). now, consider that the ageing is also a happens very quickly when a person doesn't feel too good.

therefore, I must conclude that whatever happened after I went to sleep, the feeling, went from feeling pretty good (I went to sleep reading steiner in a pretty lucid state) to things feeling relatively bad. for a fruit, this probably manifests itself as getting really ripe or withering really quickly, and for a human this may have the effect of feeling sick or out of sorts.

whatever the case, I say that you are time traveling all of the time. yesterday felt really different than today, and even a few hours ago could feel pretty different from now. if you were able to feel like you felt yesterday, you would teleport into yesterday and live again from there, but because you know that today exists, it's very difficult to lose your memory of today so you can go back to yesterday. what I mean is, any change in how you feel adjusts your trajectory through time, so whether we switched timelines or not, clearly the trajectory changed when I went to sleep. therefore, sudden changes in the manifestations of how things feel like aging, or a feeling like you're in another time is essentially time travel. I also add in rain because it seems that rain occurs when it feels like things are not going the way that they should be going (like, an emphasis that things should be different, changed in some way, so it rains[^1]). I associate rain with a change in the energy.

[1]: this reminded me of rain dances, where if you're looking at a drout, things are the same, so really the rain dance is is just a process whereby you get yourself mentally ready for things to be different than how they are.

#### divine messenger edits

another possible edit:

    Now we must realise that the end of the Atlantean era is characterized by these groups of human entities.

the word "characterize" doesn't appear anywhere else in the text. he uses the word "characteristics" a lot more instead. also, why wouldn't he spell it "characterise"?

again, this is talking about these "divine messengers" the ones that are guiding the atlantian people and have very unequal amounts of power over the rest of the humans.

the sense that I get is that the descriptions of these "divine messengers" and what they're able to do is sounding a lot like nosebook and their capabilities, but they're doingt it now with technology instead of something else which is probably what's edited out. that's my guess, anyway.

I also notice that things in my life have a strong frequential or resonance to it, so today after I wrote the previous sections (about the edits and the manu), I went outside to see what is happening at the yard sale because I remembered that there was a blanket that I wanted to buy.

for some really strange reason, the melissa (the woman that owns the house), made a big point of changing the subject of whatever she was talking about with remi previously, cause she raised her voice and made sure that I could hear her say, "did you hear about the woman that got abducted" ... remi said no or something, so she then went on to explain more details about it saying something like, "I hope they find her" -- to which I responded that there's no way that anyone's location is unknown. everybody is fully tracked, so they definitely do know where she is.

she tried to change the subject but I changed it back. she said that it's not a thing, but I insisted that it is. she changed the subject again. I think remi tried to change the subject, but I wanted to explain that *everything* in the human body is electrical, so everything can be tracked. you can get the signals that the eyes are seeing, all of the senses, etc., so there's no reason for anyone to ever be lost or to have anyone missing. they know where everyone is, so these random stories that come out on the news are done on purpose. I don't know the reason, and I don't know why people keep talking about people that are missing when, it's clearly not the case.

what I'm saying in all of that, is the subject of them having all kinds of information on people aed their attempts to control (though it seems like they're doing a pretty good job of it because so many people are willing to lie for them) -- that, something similar to that is what was edited out of the book.

we're living in a repeat of the atlantian thing, and I'm fairly certain that the hypothesis of his book (though I've only read the first 4 chapters) is that there are 7 root-races, the atlantians were the 4th. there are 7 sub-races, and that the 6th and 7th races decline into such decadence that only a certain number of people that can make an evolutionary leap over the decadence.

it's not like it's a big deal anyway... I think this book has a bit of a trickster aspect to it already because I don't think steiner is saying what is written. I'm trying to describe above that his writings about manu are seriously bipolar and don't make a lot of sense. now, whether that's the edits that have been done, or if that's the way steiner encoded a message, I don't know, but he sounds exactly like what you might expect if you follow weird religious nonsense, but the opposite of what you would think if you gave it any thought. the irony being that the aryan root-race is learning how to compare, analyse, and think for oneself. so if that's the case, then why would he come to tell you how to think so that you can follow him. doesn't make any sense!

### root-races

the word "race" is a bit unfortunate because we associate it with skin colour and bone structure, yet I don't get the impdression that steiner is "racist" at all, even though he uses the word race. the overwhelming sense that I have is he is talking about mental capacity. I've struggled with this very concept for a while because I want to say, "someone that is highly aware of their feelings" -- and, if I say a "sensitive person" that could mean a lot of things, especially in spanish (sensible means sensible and also sensitive) -- or, if I say, "indigo person" wtf does that even mean, right? my point is, there isn't a good way to define this characteristic.

so, if what he means when he says "aryan" is a person that is capable of mental calculations rather than memory, this clearly doesn't have anything to do with skin colour -- rather that aryan is the name that the group of people that started this trend of mental calculating called theirselves (it's also related to the zodiac symbol aries).

now, how would I call the next group of people that are coming out as individual thinkers, but not only that, they have a high degree of sensitivity to concept and emotion? well, I couuld call them aryan, but thatz name is taken, so perhaps I'll call the aquaryan (lol) -- ok, maybe aquarian so the racists don't get upset (cause everyone can see the "I" in the word when I say aquarian, rather than the "why" in the word aquaryan).

that's actually kind of an interesting coincidence because "why" is the operative question to ask yourself when you want to begin thinking for yourself. this is why kids ask why so much and adults hate it, because they've been trained to no longer ask why.

meanwhile, the letter "I" is one of individuality. individuality means something that cannot be divided. it is singular -- so that, if you take one kenny and cut him into two pieces, you don't get two kenny -- you still have one kenny, now dead[^1]. I've been thinking about what the coming root-race would contain for qualities, and it has a lot to do with individuality. I'll make a case for it later.
