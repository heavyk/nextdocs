I was thinking outside about how things have changed between the first joint I smoked (9-11) and the one this morning and how abstract and conceptual things have gotten.

I was also thinking about the "worst possible manifestation" and how it feels weird for me to be looking at all of this great stuff, but then I know that as soon as reality kenny kicks back in, we're going to go straight for the WPM again.

again, the reason for this is because you keep going, so you want enough contrast to produce another WPM after that, and so fourth.

I started to think about the WPM and how it was defined just *!!three!!* days ago, and how I'll be going right back to that, but I'll be doing it from a totally hilarious perspective.

it reminded me of "el trabajo do sao miguel" (sorry for bad language), and how at the ceremony, this is in fact the work of saint michael. he wants you to really work hard at singing the hymn in the traditional way as reality just sorta melts around you. I could feel the whole political system being like, we can't wait for this guy to finish up, we have a bunch of really important stuff that needs to be done. that's saint michael saying you gatta keep trying to pay attention to the hymnal -- cept, the hymnal is the US political situation. pay attention here and ignore the fact that reality is disolving andy your prior expections and beliefs about reality are no longer holding true.

so, if you look at this from another perspective, it makes perfect sense. imagine now for a moment that there is a massive cosmic ray particle that's traveling at some ungodly speed well beyond anything physical's capacity to detect it. this particle is "the worst possible manifestation", and it's going to have a tremendous impact when it hits, and it's being attracted all the time by all sorts of people in smaller quantities.

it has a fractal infinite of similarly vibrating particles that procede and precede it in both space and time, but most importantly in time. each time someone expects the WPM, it happens, that attracts it closer, so we're attracting it faster more and more with our predictions of the future.

you can probably also see that this frequency is a frequency of desire, so it's really really fast and not exactly physical. imagine now all of the primaries as having a pressure wave where things rotate opposite between two mediums, and so we'll consider those regions the transition regions.

desire (1) and structure (3) have such a region, and that is where the pressure wave of desire turns the opposite direction of the lower frequency rules (these are points of consciousness that look at each other and larger and larger symbols in a rythmic fashion). it's those rules that then produce something that's capable of going again the opposite direction, manifesting itself down in physical.

the physical layer has two sub layers one of forms/concepts (5), and one of physical matter (7). so each pressure wave is pushing new things in to the lower layer. rules and structure have to find a way to accomodate the pressure wave of desire and still maintain its rhythmic balance. then similarly, those new rules/symbols push another frequncy int the conceptual layer, and all concepts that are resonant with the vibration attract it and it adds to the concept. anything that doesn't resonate would eventually make its way into the physical, but because our physical is entirly composed of concepts, this doesn't happen often. newborn children and drug experiences are a good way to get vibration that doesn't conform to the concepts which define physical into reality[^1].

so from the perspective of desire, it looks like desire is pushing on rules and symbols, which then after the midpoint (4) they are then *received* into similarly resonating concepts, and all of the overflow ia absorbed in the physical into people on drugs and/or newborn babies (probably other things too like weather and PK). that's the basic way that an elemental is created. it's just manifestation of a desire that reality present.0 isn't capable of rendering into something conceivable (until it is, of course, then it can appear in the conceivable form).

all of the stuff happening in US politics is *really important*. we gatta stick to the hymnal.

this whole concept related to something I read in the book of the same title of by steiner. I thought I'd start out here though...

[1]: it's for this reason that I believe we see hyperbolic geometry, because it's the closest way to describe that vibration. it doesn't have the concepts to render it into anything else. this is why you feel connected to the universe, but you don't have words or even a picture, so that's why the hyperbolic geometry.

### 2022-09-14 12:12 - as an example...

I was just thinking about steiner's "st. michael's work", and the thought that came to me was that I should just leave all of the marketing team to be out there and go nuts, that way I can kind of stay out of the public sphere. I'm not like exactly opposed to the idea as I'm not really all *that* excited about living a public life in the first place.
