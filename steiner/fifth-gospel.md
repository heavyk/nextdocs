### lecture-1 - christianity powered by non-intellectuals

through these unsophisticated people, christiantity spread comparitavely rapidly.

this thought connects with the later vision that he relates where buddha appears to jesus and explains that it's an impossibility for all humans to be essenes, because they require separateness from the rest of humankind.

in other words, it's not going to be the intellectuals or anyone else that seems to see themself as separate, superior, or different than the rest, which will unite humankind.

though christianty was opposed by an advanced society of individuals, it was through these unsophisticated non-intellectuals that the idea spread so quickly (even more powerful of an argument if you consider 1k of the last 2k didn't happen). it reminds me a bit of weeds and wheat. the reason is obvious, steiner concludes: intellectuals don't understand the "christ impulse"

he then goes on to say that all of modern science has been born out of the "christian impulse" (and when he says impulse, the sense I get is somewhere between marketing and motivation - 2nd ray power). this occurred because modern science gave all of these advanced intellectuals something to push against, which was this group of unsophisicated christians exploring the realms of the spirit. the catholic church tried to ban these advances in science and also in spirituality. this concept connects with the one later on when jesus is troubled by the images of lucifer and ahriman that are coming out of the essene gates. what function does lucifer and ahriman have? he's setting up the basic triad relationship here.

---

in the next lecture, he basically lays out that these unsophisicated and uneducated people went through a transformation in the pentecost, where they were completely transformed, gaining access to all aspects of reality, clairvoyant perception and the like. it's pretty obvious to me that these normal everyday guys will begin to figure out how some things worked (eg. science) with their clairvoyant perception (I call thi "expanded perception") that they began to make discoveries (eg. science).

steiner is basically saying that the "christian impulse" was actually a sort of clairvoyant form of perception that was not done through initiation, but by simply accepting jesus into your heart.

I now understand what my dad says when he asks me if reading the bible makes me feel a burning sensation. he's talking about the "fire of the holy spirit" decending and giving clairvoyant perception. I didn't have that happen. I think I was born with clairvoyance, but then lost it with a woman only to regain it again by releasing resistance and staring into a "son" (star) of God during the night. I was twice not intitiated into this clairvoyant perception (though I did accept jesus into my heart as a child, that wasn't what expanded my vision).

so what we see happening is a sort of repeat of my own life. I did not go to school to learn programming; I'm self-taught. I didn't go to school to learn about the 7-layers-of-perception, minus the document that got me started, I figured it out myself. I have begun inqeries into and had discoveries relating to cosmological, scientific, emotional, conceptual, and psycological subjects -- all with relative ease. instead of relating these accomplishments to being a function of having expanded vision -- mine is quite blurry and my imagination doesn't work, which has only served to strengthen my non-visual senses, I attribute this instead to emotional or conceptual capacity (ie. 5th ray conceptual rather than 6th ray clairvoyance).

almost certainly, these inqueries and related discoveries have fueled buth the scientific and religious/parapsycological communities, meanwhile the church (nosebook), is busy trying to suppress them. it's also most likely motivated people who would have never given much thought to intuition and emotion as a means of scientific discovery to perhaps reconsider their perspective. so, in that sense, you may say that I have the *opposite* of this christ impulse. I'll consider that I have the anti-christ impulse, for reasons which I'll expound upon later. the organisational structure is the same: the average person (everybody) has access to their emotions, so not only is this more accessible than the fire of the holy spirit, you don't need to even do anything to get it, and nobody can take it from you either. quite literally everyone has access to this, which means that you only need to have been born into a human body to get it; no need for christs, initiations, or special arrangements like the essenes had.

### lecture-2 - if I see it, I'll believe it

this lecture talks about how from the time that they were in the garden of gethsemane until the day of pentecost, they were in a deep sleep. he recounts how jesus tells them to stay at guard, but they keep falling asleep. that slumber continued on and they remained in that dream-like state until the pentecost, at which time they suddenly started to begin to remember all of the events that had transpired in the previous days (the denial, the crucifixion, etc.)

this all sounds extremely suspect to me. if I just take steiner at face value here, this sounds like the disciples had memories implanted, and that for the entirety of the event, they were in a state of mesmerism.

the interesting thing to note here is that steiner is relating all of these things from his clairvoyant standpoint, and so from his perspective (as well as the disciples, because he's recounting this from peter's perspective), these highly symbolic events all happened just as the memory says that they did. personally, I don't really believe this whole death and crucifixion stuff. I always skipped over the final chapters of the gospels when I read them because they didn't feel good, and nowadays I've come to believe that jesus' death had more to do with mutual-back-scratching than it had with anything else. I've written about this previously, so I find it funny that rudolf here is getting duped by his own atlantian image based memory, that the adepts used to control the masses of atlantians. it's a bit ironic. perhaps rudolf is a bit of a trickster.

interesgingly enough rudolf may not have actually been that unaware, because he repeatedly says that he's "relating the images [as he saw them]" and lets out other hints such as when he says, "the *image* of jesus taken down from the cross and put into the tomb".

the other possible clue is something that I cannot independently verify because I don't have clairvoyant vision right now, but he says that when the moon passes in front of the sun during an eclipse, all individual consciousness looses its vibrance, meanwhile group consciousness, such as things of nature seem to come alive. he relates this as the moon is symbolic of the knowledge of the earth, and that sometimes it gets in the way of the radiance of the sun. when this happens (these eclipses), there is a passing away and a starting over, symbolically speaking.

he then relates that at the day of pentecost, peter realised that jesus' death was only *apparent*; in reality, this death, preceded by infinite suffering, was a birth, for the whole earth, of the spirit that had entered his soul like a ray.

I must say my opinion on this. first of all, I'm pretty certain that jesus' death was mutual-back-scratching, and it was designed to acquire a new form of perception (where you see yourself as a concept of yourself - 5d perception). this new form of perception increases the bandwidth of the "visible" -- whereas before 5d was probably incomprehensible (like taking a very heroic dose of mushrooms or ayahusca), he made it possible for this world to be conceptualised at that high frequency. the goal here, I believe is that this form of perception got encoded into jesus' bloodline and that allowed the roman emperors a further capacity to continue to live out their lives in these bodies and have considerable mental superiority over the rest of the people.

I say this is mutual-back-scratching because in the long game, what this means is that gives all of these "fallen-angels" (roman emperors, today's "elite") the genetics to not fall apart over the next few thousand years. he's giving them a boost, knowing that one day technology will eventually win out over perception. also, for jesus, this means he's now released from time and space. he can now drop into any time or space he tunes into and appear the concept that he perceives himself as (this reminds me of elijah).

we have no idea how many time edits were done, but I'm fairly certain that from that time onward, the timeline was influenced (most certainly with the help of the romans mutual-back-scratching) to continue to ensure the "worst" thing happens. he would ensure they continue to stay alive (though as with all marketing, there's always an expiration date -- so probably not forever cause a forever product is bad marketing).

now another reaction that has happened since yesterday was my comment dark ages. I wasn't meaning that the dark ages didn't happen, but that the supposed 1ky timespan called the dark aged between 300-1300ad never happend. the way I have come to see it now is that while the romans got new bodies with much expanded perception, this "clairvoyant" 4d perception was given to certain followers of christ (as defined in dtp), and this allowed for all of the gothic cathedral building, the templars, massive advances in science and technology and so fourth. to counter this, the church's capacity to try and prevent this was tremendously boosted because of their expanded (5d) perception.

as you know from LOA, the church's focus on trying to get rid of all of the advances in technology only fueled the advances and made them even more. I propose that this clairvoyant percetion given to scientists, thinkers and esoteric societies, and other followers of christ compressed time so much that an entire 1000y could be removed from our history and we wouldn't even notice it because the church (romans) were able to cause such a signifcant decrease in technology.

there were also likely other future waves of extra difficulty as well. you have to now consider the nazi party's intent on using eugenics to purify the earth, so I imagine that if they were given time traveling saucers, that probably explains the extra wave of plages and pestilance. it may also be the same phenomenon too, because the sense that I get from steiner is that this darkness that covered the area at that time during his "death" was very similar to the inky black mists described by bramley in his chapters on the plagues during the middle ages. it's pretty possible that these are designed to make everyone feel worse, so that we could move to a worse feeling timeline (and compress time even further).

where all of this is going, I believe is [the technological singularity](/jorjani-thoughts.md#the-singularity) where each person is creating their own reality and each person is their own saviour, or destroy theirselves -- and, at the end of that 1000y of "peace" (you make your own reality version of what peace means to you), will be that final alchemical gold that emerges from the fire (sun).

the whole point is that once technology is high enough, everyone can be their own saviour. say it is 1000y, and that you have the new roman empire (nosebook) fighting against people figuring out their conceptual capabilities, again, what you're going to have is a dramatic rise in technology, which the romans will try to prevent, forcing everyone excommunicated from their group to either find a way to feel the way they want to feel or to destroy theirselves.

easy. everyone is their own manu.

    "the apostles' state of soul at that time was such that they could only *participate* in the death of jesus in an *abnormal state of consciousness*" (emphasis mine)

#### further thoughts on this

I wrote that I think it was funny that he got duped by his own atlantian recollection of memory, form of perceiving the past, but I don't believe now at all that is what happened. I think he may have suspect that something different than what was apparent, because he only talks about the events from the perspective of the apostles. I think he may have tried to remote view jesus' perspective in it too, and that may be what he's referring to at the end of the lecture when he says that he can't get the density right. if jesus attained 5d in that death experience like I think he did, then that could explain not only the part of them not being able to recognise jesus in "risen" form versus the physical form, because he was appearing to them as the concept of their perception now, and so that's why the physical image had to be overlaid on top of the spiritual image.

at any rate, I do think he suspects something not immediately apparent happened here and that's the whole point of why he says in the beginning of the lecture that he thinks that in the future history will be taught by actively looking at the events clairvoyant so we can look at history as it "really happened", rather than the prevailing narrative. I also feel that's why he said that he feels in the future it will be possible and that in the future it's possible to talk about these subjects with more accuracy, because of the higher frequency images were not totally able to be decoded by him.

### lecture-3 - solar initiation made possible without leaving the earth

steiner has a really strange way of talking... something about the mithraic seven stages of initiation, where you started out with inner things, then became a liason for the nation, then more than the nation, then the solar system (a "sun hero")

pardon my personal comment here, but all of this sounds pretty hokey. sun hero is something I would think of naming a children's toy, so I guess he was right when he said all of these things sound silly to the modern mind.

- raven
- occult person / secret one
- fighter
- lion
- liason of nation
- liason of earth
- liason of sun

however foolish sounding it may be, there might be some sense to what he has to say. if I take the first 4 he has there and call this the 3d experience, the others correspond pretty well to the other dimensions:

- liason of nation (outward looking 4d)
- liason of earth (inward looking 5d)
- liason of sun (outward looking 6d)

so, if I'm following him correctly, what he's saying is that what jesus did is to take 6d perception and make it possible here on earth.

just a quick refresher: 6d perception is where you are able to enter into the body of another person, place, or thing and perceive the world from their perspective. you have access to all of their thoughts, their conception of the world and all of their senses. this is kind of like nosebook, but nosebook does not give you that (as he called it in the beginning of the lecture), "direct living experience, a feeling and power of the soul"

this 6d perspective is 4th ray perception, which is the the upgrade from astral 6th ray perception. if you were a sun, then this 4th ray perception would be outward looking (and 6th and 2nd ray inward), but for human body types, we are opposite, so that 6th ray and 2nd are outward looking, but 4th ray is opposite, so you see from the perspective of the other entitiy you tune into and experience it as if you are that entity.

this is what various places calls "principalities and powers", where, for example, when beginning to work for a corporation, you will take on (to some amount) the demeanour of the corporation. you see things and feel things as the corporation feels it (hence the initiation of the nation, then of the earth first in the mithraic intiations). as this capacity increases, it's possible to feel how anything from a stone to a corporation, another person, to a planet or star feels. for those interested, this is definitely one of the things you'll quickly learn when star-watching, too, btw.

when I say this, I am simply referring to tuning into the vibration of, so in the next part here he makes a note that a person thinks that a dead person cannot suffer, and that is clearly false because otherwise a rock could suffer. the reason why a soul or person in a physical body can suffer is because of a disharmony with their environment or their source; and that disharmony is what causes the suffering. most people believe that the obvious thing is to then accept the suffering or try and change the environment (we humans love to modify our environment to improve how we feel about it).

low powered 4th ray perception is just falling into the demeanour of the dominant vibration of the most dominant entity, but as you get more powerful 4th ray perception, you start to pick up on any and every vibration in your environment. most people keep this blocked off and filtered out because it'll cause them paralysis to maintain a normal productive life. however, as one releases more and more resistance, other vibrations other than your own can be experienced and they don't really bother you so much -- first, because you don't really have as much resistance (opposite destructive interference vibrations -- so usually higher frequency but can be same frequency too) -- and second, because your own vibbration is either stronger or has fast recovery.

we all know what stronger is: 100W transmitter is more than 10W transmitter -- but, what is fast recovery? fast recovery is a strong self-identity, where if you get thrown off by something (like say a really powerful psychedellic experince or a tragedy), then you can return back to feeling yourself pretty quickly -- and most importantly, it's good to bring something back with you from the experience too, so in the middle of the experience, if you can retain a bit of self-identity, you can manage to apply the new feeling to your identity vibration.

4th ray perception is just being able to tune into something else really well, rather than look at it from the outside like 2nd or 6th ray perception.
