### lecture-1 - christianity powered by non-intellectuals

through these unsophisticated people, christiantity spread comparitavely rapidly.

this thought connects with the later vision that he relates where buddha appears to jesus and explains that it's an impossibility for all humans to be essenes, because they require separateness from the rest of humankind.

in other words, it's not going to be the intellectuals or anyone else that seems to see themself as separate, superior, or different than the rest, which will unite humankind.

though christianty was opposed by an advanced society of individuals, it was through these unsophisticated non-intellectuals that the idea spread so quickly (even more powerful of an argument if you consider the dark ages never happened). it reminds me a bit of weeds and wheat. the reason is obvious, steiner concludes: intellectuals don't understand the "christ impulse"

he then goes on to say that all of modern science has been born out of the "christian impulse" (and when he says impulse, the sense I get is somewhere between marketing and motivation - 2nd ray power). this occurred because modern science gave all of these advanced intellectuals something to push against, which was this group of unsophisicated christians exploring the realms of the spirit. the catholic church tried to ban these advances in science and also in spirituality. this concept connects with the one later on when jesus is troubled by the images of lucifer and ahriman that are coming out of the essene gates. what function does lucifer and ahriman have? he's setting up the basic triad relationship here.

in the next lecture, he basically lays out that these unsophisicated and uneducated people went through a transformation in the pentecost, where they were completely transformed, gaining access to all aspects of reality, clairvoyant perception and the like. it's pretty obvious to me that these normal everyday guys will begin to figure out how some things worked (eg. science) with their clairvoyant perception (I call thi "expanded perception") that they began to make discoveries (eg. science).

steiner is basically saying that the "christian impulse" was actually a sort of clairvoyant form of perception that was not done through initiation, but by simply accepting jesus into your heart.

I now understand what my dad says when he asks me if reading the bible makes me feel a burning sensation. he's talking about the "fire of the holy spirit" decending and giving clairvoyant perception. I didn't have that happen. I think I was born with clairvoyance, but then lost it with a woman only to regain it again by releasing resistance and staring into a "son" (star) of God during the night. I was twice not intitiated into this clairvoyant perception (though I did accept jesus into my heart as a child, that wasn't what expanded my vision).

so what we see happening is a sort of repeat of my own life. I did not go to school to learn programming; I'm self-taught. I didn't go to school to learn about the 7-layers-of-perception, minus the document that got me started, I figured it out myself. I have begun inqeries into and had discoveries relating to cosmological, scientific, emotional, conceptual, and psycological subjects -- all with relative ease. instead of relating these accomplishments to being a function of having expanded vision -- mine is quite blurry and my imagination doesn't work, which has only served to strengthen my non-visual senses, I attribute this instead to emotional or conceptual capacity (ie. 5th ray conceptual rather than 6th ray clairvoyance).

almost certainly, these inqueries and related discoveries have fueled buth the scientific and religious/parapsycological communities, meanwhile the church (nosebook), is busy trying to suppress them. it's also most likely motivated people who would have never given much thought to intuition and emotion as a means of scientific discovery to perhaps reconsider their perspective. so, in that sense, you may say that I have the *opposite* of this christ impulse. I'll consider that I have the anti-christ impulse, for reasons which I'll expound upon later. the organisational structure is the same: the average person (everybody) has access to their emotions, so not only is this more accessible than the fire of the holy spirit, you don't need to even do anything to get it, and nobody can take it from you either. quite literally everyone has access to this, which means that you only need to have been born into a human body to get it; no need for christs, initiations, or special arrangements like the essenes had.
