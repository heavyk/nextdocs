#### (43:55) - cooperative cells

as they were talking in the previous section the first time I listened to it, I could see something like a planet with all sorts of plants and animals on it -- and when a new thing gets added to the planet, it reminded me of a puppy or a kitten when it discovers something new: it sniffs it out and tries to acclamate to it. it isn't until it is attacked (or has a history of being attaced by similar things) that it will become aggressive in return.

the thing is I like to imagine myself as a sort of heierarchy of me -- and like if I imagine I give myself a thing, I don't want him to just reject it outright but to find anything useful it can take from the thing and leaving the rest.

I sort of imagine this is how viruses and cells work inside of the body too. it's actually very surprising to me that malicious viruses even exist -- as I would have imagined that the successful ones could only continue to exist if they have some energy supporting its continued existence. like, I imagine the same thing is happening on the atomic scale -- where only the stable isotopes continue to emist because they have a frequency to support their continued existence.

what I'm saying is that I bet viruses are sort of like tiny patches to the genome to maintain compatibility with the body's most active frequencies.

it was cool man... I saw it all working cascading consciousness starting at the parent entity and working its way all the way down to the cell, molecule, and atom.

#### (15:32) - are they talking to me??

I just got done writing the previous entry (@[noseblog](2021-06-27 23:57)) where I was talking about how I do not wish to fill the place af abraham. they say, "you have to want to communicate ... with people" -- but I don't really. I do my best to figure it out as I go. I'm obviously still learning and have no intention to try and even get things right.

my "method" is zero effort and it sort of starts to make sense after a while. I'm totally winging it almost all the time. I just happen to be good at tuning is all. they talked about how it requires using a lot of differerent words and approaches to the same concept -- and that's kinda what I already do. I translate the same concept differently depending who I'm talking to. I already do that, and I know from listening to them that after hearing the same concept said so many different ways, I begin to get a sense of it and feel like I "know" the concept.

#### (21:56) - have to stir up some trouble in order for some greater gbood to come from it

as they were reading the question, the whole situation sounded to me like one that I would have a very difficult time not bursting out into laughter at some of that stuff.. for me the solution to those ridiculous things are just to laugh at them. I suggested that the writer do the same. then, I heard the writer was chinese and thought to myself, "dang there's no way they have the ability to laugh at it then" (because they're chinese)

I guess there's some wisdom in knowing I "have to stir up some trouble in order for some greater gbood to come from it"

lol...

#### (27:22) - formats and expectations

> don't be affraid to follow their format. you will not lose yourself in the process.

as they were talking about going along with the conductor without risking losing the music flowing to me, I was thinking about how a long time ago mr. motor used to really bother me. I don't even think he loses my music anymore and I genuinely miss the constant motor roar in response to a large number of my thoughts. I guess it's like if you're used to the TV being on and you go somewhere with silence it feels weird -- kinda like that. also, it's just a good time for me to go out and listen to mr. motor get bent out of shape over my thoughts. it kinda "eggs me on", actually.

anyway, I was thinking if I'm doing things my way I'll follow along the whole way but I probably will be laughing at the absurdity for most of it. they'll probably take it all the wrong way and get deeply offended and hurt. oh well.

I want to laugh and have fun and I find so much of their seriousness hilarious. I will follow their format, but I don't intend to be serious about any of it. my goal is to find new and exciting forms of communication, art, and expression and I want to have fun along the way.

---

I think the main thing to notice is that they believe that the only way they can feel good, essentially is with sex. the rest of the time they have to be serious. I don't mind others having sex at all and I don't mind contemplation either, but that's not how I intend to feel good. I enjoy joking around and creating things.

what I mean is, if someone wants me to take them really seriously, I will. however, if by seriously, you want me to feel bad with you, I'll try I guess. in this example, I would take the racist self-flagulation ceremony seriously and then do my best not to laugh.

I don't intend to make a mockery of all the big serious problems but at some point, it may appear that way. in that sense, you've maybe got the wrong guy.

better said: back when my life was a pretty big mess, it was a lot easier to let go the need to defend my predicament by joking about it. with all of my problems, I try to just laugh and move on. if laughing doesn't feel good, then there's still considerable resistance I have remaining. I like to try to make big problems feel smaller by breaking them into bits. that usually makes them feel funny (dad used to do this to me all the time). I can attempt to be serious about things though. maybe you'll find my seriousness funny.

---

right, all of that is assuming I remain out of alignment. I use humour as a way of coping. I have idea what it's like to be in alignment though. that may change my attitude considerably. you guys likely know better than me.

#### (27:10) - doing things the right ways

I feel like, and it's not necessarily the colour of my skin but it feels like, especially in the tech world that there is a right way to do things (even though it's called "disruptive technologies") and I'm just not aiming to be right or to do things right either. I'm one of those types that does things wrong, "for see what happens". the right way is never found -- just more optimal ways to do a thing. I want to discover new things and do things new ways -- so I may not fit the expectations. jufst saying...

#### (29:17) - charismatic people taking over the group

I've always been very charismatic but I have not usually tried to take over the group. very frequently I try to be on my own, yet for some reason people seem to insist that I join their group.

I'm frequently leaving the group because I want to do things my way. when I try to leave, often times people follow me so I have resorted often trying to push people away or leave quietly because I don't want to compete. I want to do things my own way but it seems the people following me around have an idea of how they want me to do it (or not do it), but they don't want to do their own group.

I have noticed that they seem to do well when I'm doing things my way but then they want to tell me how to do it (instead of letting me figure it out) so I take off to go do it my way -- then they follow me and tell me I can't do it the way that is clearly working.

---

from my perspective most of the "charismatic" types are sales team. the product team is a whole different breed of person. the sales types used to run the world but times have changed a bit since then.

what it is is these charismatcic types are good at affecting how others feel. watch women -- especially the attractive or really wounded ones and notice how they seem to bend reality by manipulating the way others to feel.

though I can influence how people feel, my goal is never to dominate the situation by manipulating the way others feel (the sales/charismatic way). instead, I just feel what I feel strongly (usually about what I want to create) and if that's something that resonates with someone, then they follow me.

the ones that try to tell me how to do stuff usually like to be the boss, so I just leave and go somewhere else. seems there's always somenone following me around ensuring I never get too much time to myself either. I've never ever been able to live by myself. I've always wanted to.

---

as a rule, I follow my feelings on a person because appearance/charisma is very deceiving.

#### (38:54) - selling a feeling

I literally just got done wtriting about this because selling artwork is like sales without imagination. when sales wants to sell something, they generate a bunch of words and imagination pictures whmich gives a feeling -- and people buy that sensation those words and images give.

selling artwork is nothing like that. there's no one there to narrate a pitch into the buyer's ear while they look at the painting. instead, they can *feel* what the artist has imbued into it.

I know this exactly. this is why I like art, have bought paintings and like listening to live music. I can feel the feeling that the artist has put into it.

in a sense the art-form is "selling" a feeling. the imagination is secondary. the feeling will often times evoke an image or a sensation -- and I assure you it's not the notes or the paint, but the feeling the artist felt in that expression.

#### (44:04) - just love him anyway

man I dislike that expression. when somenone is annoying, the last thing I want to hear is to love him anyway. that would be like you telling me in 2019 to just love mr. motor anyway.

yeah right. for me, I think a good first step is to find a way to put up with his antics until he no longer bothers me. then once he's finally tolerable -- meaning his antics no longer bother me, then I can start to notice his positive aspects naturally.

some people, I found I have to just let them be ridiculous. they can sense when I'm trying too hard to make the situation something other than it is and actually derive a bit of pleasure out of watching me waste my time.

### 2021-07-05 14:32 - (2021-04-10 p1)

#### (13:26) - make more decisions every day

some part of this resonates with me. their answer of saying that the continued expression of their desire into physical is the best way to consciously make the connection of knowing one's alignment or allowance of the stream (of well-being).

one of the things I definitely do less of in my present circumstance is making less decisions. I talked in a previous entry about how I was following some sort of abstract script sorta ad-libing the whole way, so I know that if they could have it their way, I wouldn't have to make any decisions at all ever again and just follow their script.

it's sort of logical I suppose but I'm realising that every time a new decision is made it is capable for more energy to be allowed and also that each time it's possible to *feel* the calibration of the allowance of that energy created from the decision.

### (21:21) - tuning to the emotions of others

what they are talking about is what I'm talking about so much too. they're talking about tuning to someone else's frequency and accomplishing a similar frequency as them. this is step 3. you can tune to the frequency of your source and allow that energy to flow or you can tune to the frequency of someone (or something) else and allow that energy to flow. when that energy flowing doesn't feel good then you're either now in step 1 again or you're in step 5 and that energy no longer bothers you or feels bad.

as an example, I tune to mr. motor all the time. he used to really bother me, but now I can tune to him (really almost any bad-feeling thing) now and still find a way to feel good. there are still some examples where I can feel anger and depression when I tune to him, and that's a good thing because I am a master of perception now and can perceive virtually anything now in a way which resonates with my source.

all I'm saying is it's possible to find a way to feel the way your source about anyone. this is optimal because then you don't have to hide from bad-feeling things.

[edit: listened a little further and it sounds like she figured that out too.. nice!]

#### (34:40) - cascade of vibration

I'm listening to a song called "it's what we expected" and they're talking about how even esther's alignment when she booked the fligt greatly influenced the conditions of that flight -- solidifying the point they're making about how your alignment trumps the driver of the vehicle's alignment. however, as they're talking, I have this image in my head about how the emotional vibration (expectation) put into anything produces a cascade of events in harmony with the sum of those vibrations.

my emperience with sound, has taught me that adding more low vibration (bass) instruments, just makes that frequency range sound muddy. no matter hmow muddy the low vibration is, the high vibration sound will still carry over the top (strum the guitar then flip it upside down and strum with the opposite hand for a good illustration of this) and doesn't get interfere with the lower vibrations [something like that. prolly not the best description. maybe there's a better way to illustrate this concept].

what I mean is, imagine you have booked a plane flight and you're playing a high note. other people (pilots, flight attendents, etc), and conditions like weather, timing, which have a similar pitch will meet you on the flight. there could be a while symphony of bass guitars on the flight as well, but they can't drown out the high pitched note no matter how hard they play their instruments. I'm referring to live. digital recordings do not have a dynamic range and experience clipping so a loud bass can drown out a high pitched instrument.

so, I liked how this picture was illustrating what they are saying. if you're in alignment with your source (high frequency), it doesn't matter how many obnoxious bass guitar players playing, you will still find things resonant with your high pitch.

#### (39:30) - have as little split energy as possible

I had an interesting reaction on this one because in the last entry @[noseblog](2021-07-05 05:25) I wrote about how I'm learning to play both sides of the field at the same time. I'm not splitting my energy but actually doubling it. both sides of the field are maximum wanted (what I'm actively tuning to) and maximum unwanted wich is just the 180(degrees) out of phase version of max wanted. if you add them together you would get no movement which is what split energy is -- going opposite directions at the same time.

I'm doubling the energy because of my utilisation of perception. both max wanted and max unwanted contain both max unwanted *and* max wanted at the same time; they're just 180(degrees) out of phase from each other. I get to choose which part of the wave I look at. if I look at 0 to 90 on both they exactly cancel each other out but if I find the wanted aspect of both, then I'm looking at 0 to 90 on the first and 180 to 270 on the second. split energy is peception not conditions.
