### 2023-04-22 05:14 - quick theory

so continuing on my idea of venus and the idea that the symbols that are happening here on earth are (received and retransmitted through the emotional/conceptual framework of saturn) over to annother earth (vega) -- right, and so imagine that a guy is here and he does a whole bunch of stuff which causes a lot of problems (kinda like me) ... OK, I'll tell the story the other way around: imagine for a moment that you're on another earth and your earth has this guy that's walking around saying and writing all of these outlandish things -- and something like trying to understand someone talking to you while you're half-asleep, their words are influencing your dream, and they're telling you things that are partially part of the dream, yet also partially what they're trying to ttell you.
imagine for a moment that everyone on the other earth is experiencing those symbols a little bitt differently because tthey have slightly different concepts/interpretions for those symbols/form/architypes and the operations that are happening between them.
I'll give an example: zaryn called me a few weeks ago and asked me if I wanted to go to spain and hang out with him and talk about his conspiracy theories about us living in a sort of simulation. I balked at tthe idea a bit and wrote my thoughts on it a bit. I believe the way it got interpretted by some is that I kinda made light of situation -- or, I don't know how to explain it, because so many people took our conversations with him and mom (along with the things I wrote) to mean a pretty wide diversity of things. some people felt I was making fun of him, others that I was boasting, etc. the next day, someone posted a [TA game that they casted](https://youtu.be/sczG7pnfBRo) where someone who appeared to be losing, ran in d-gunned down a bunch of stuff with his commander, then proceeded to win the game. at the end of it all, he decided to write the guy a poem. well, the conclusion to my whole zaryn epic was [an epic poem](/ideas/lord-of-the-throne.md) called "lord of the throne" where I translated his top-down energy for a game based off of TA (called BAR), into a project that I thoughtt better fit his style; it was almost as if the symbols that had played out in the previous few days got somehow encapsulated into a game between two players, which then I would watch.

to understand the idea, we need to take a look at the idea of time and resonances. I literally just wrote a thing where I explained [what the symbolic realm "looks like"](/sledge-notes.md#2023-04-22-0037---thoth-vs-venus) from an emitter and reflector's perspective. I have so much more to write on the subject, so for now the simple example we can use here is to think of words as having a sort of frequency because they have a symbol. those symbols are sort of like "chords" in a music. like, just imagine you're the you're the youth pastor and you barely know how to play guitar: so you just play 3-5 different major chords and sing to jesus with passion -- and that's good enough. right, well, those chord sequences are kind of like activations for different aspects of a symbol. they don't need to be exactly the super high frequency symbol itself, but the physical sound from the instrument and the words being sung, produce a feeling which is in some way harmonic of the symbolic archetype.
OK, so now let's try the other direction: imagine for a moment that the historical jesus is playing a play here on earth and, let's say it's one of those satyricon stories -- well, the audience that's watching the play is turning those symbols into a feeling wich then resonates with those archetypal symbols. when those symbols are activated here because of our concepts, they're then relayed out to vega, where they're presented into the very fabric of the neuma reality there on vega. when that happens, some people (depending on their concepts) see a literal tomb -- and other people, see a butthole (cause that's what they assocate with that symbol: like shakespere, lol).
so anyway, what ends up happening here on physical earth is symbolically lived out and experienced by other people in vega as a reflection of their own concepts. each person there experiences my story differently and as a reflection of their concepts. so now applying my example back to the historical jesus: what you'll have is a real physical guy that lived here and a whole bunch of stuff happened to him, but ultimately those events are going to be received and interpretted by each individual as a reflection of their concepts and symbols: so for example, if I'm playing a game of TA, the symbols will play out there; or, if I'm used to shakespere's symbols, kenny's actions are going to look very shakespere-esque.

the thing is, that because of how frequencies work, shakespere 400y in the future of the death of historical jesus can influence the rendering of those symbols during the time of the actual death. therefore, all of the varying different stories of the expereince of jesus occurred and were experienced simultaneously and are all going to be directly influenced by symbols and motivfs of the literary works that the experiencer has engaged in. therefore, literary works and the poet of today is shaping how future generations will perceive the symbols experienced here on earth; and, likewise the symbols and motives/motifs that are produced here, are the realities that are attracted here. what I mean, is the 3 days motif of agamemnon's body, and 3d of tomb sex, etc. are creating the form into which the neuma of the idea will take shape here (to say it in thoth terms).
the beauty of this whole ordeal is that *I* get to see the symbols however I want to, and so does everyone else. they and all of their literary workes create the symbols which manifest in my reality, and att the same time, you all get to experience the symbols the way that you all want to: some people will see the generalised action (like "pulls out big dick moves, then writes a poem") while others will see specifics. it's all really nice from my perspective. once you understand thoth (coming soon), it'll all make sense how awesome it is.

### 2023-04-22 22:56 - world peace

[watching rabbi tovia again](https://youtu.be/KnV6yE339Hk), and I was thinking about the idea of "world peace" cause religions have a tendency (and I'm not picking on anyone in particular) to make it about *works* -- "and you shall know them by their fruit" -- sort of thing, but for example the 1 corin 13 is a super duper good example of this. it tells us that Love is:
- patient
- kind
- does not envy
- does not boast
- *is not proud*
- does not dishonour others
- *not self-seeking*
- keeps no record of wrongs
- does not delight in evil but rejoices in truth
- *always protects*
- *always trusts*
- always hopes
- always perseveres
- *never fails*

here's the problem with that: a loving person can easily be kind, but a kind person isn't necessarily loving. likewise with proud, and not boasting either, as a loving person can also be a person that is proud or boasts -- which therefore means that for someone to be the embodiment of Love, they would have to have *all* of those qualities (which is pretty impossible). to top it all off, it says that "love never fails" -- when, the human condition is to fail and all things have their time and season, a sort of ebb and flow -- which means, it's *literally* impossible for anyone to ever achieve such a metric, ever.

likewise, world peace is also such an impossible task: in order to be able to experience world peace, one would need to tturn off the news (also helps for keeping no record of wrongs) and also find peace inside theirself, before they can see the world as peaceful (like, if you're angry, doesn't the whole world look angry?). I'm not at peace with the world, I'm not at peace with myself. the messiah, cannot *ever* make world peace, because it's not within the capability of anyone to be able to force someone to be at peace with theirself; so that world peace can happen.

it's literally impossible for this prophecy to ever work out. it looks to me like a carrot dangling in front of the horse. what I have to wonder though, is how much "prophecy" is based in wishful thinking (desire) for a manifestation from YHVH? -- when, in fact these petitions to have god force a set of works on a person or group of people voilate the basic free-will and human agency which "God" supposedly granted us (minus all of the slavery stuff) in the first place.

### 2023-04-25 01:06 - paul and saul

another theory here: in [your interview with lena](https://youtu.be/e6BExOv8WRg), she makes a far-out claim that paul is the egyptian. you ask her about the paul calling himself saul thing. so I looked it up. I believe that if her theory of the egyptian being jesus is correct, then when God refects the egyptian as the messiah, it's the same story as God rejecting saul and putting in david instead. in fact, it states it quite plainly in Acts 13:

  17 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arme brought he them out of it.
  18 And about the time of *fourtie yeeres* suffered he their maners in the wildernesse.
  19 And when he had destroyed seuen nations in the land of Chanaan, he diuided their land to them by lot:
  20 And after that he gaue vnto them iudges, about the space of foure hundred and fifty yeeres vntill Samuel the Prophet.
  21 And afterward they desired a King, and God gaue vnto them *Saul* the sonne of Cis, a man of the *tribe of Beniamin*, by the space of *fourty yeres*.
  22 And when *he had remoued him*, hee raised vp vnto them Dauid to be their king, to whom also he gaue testimonie, and said, I haue found *Dauid* the sonne of Iesse, *a man after mine own heart*, which *shal fulfill all my wil*.
  23 Of this mans seed hath God, according to his promise, raised vnto Israel a Sauiour, *Iesus*:
  24 When *Iohn* had first preached before his coming, the baptisme of repentance to all the people of Israel.
  25 And as Iohn *fulfilled his course*, he said, Whom thinke ye that I am? I am not he. But behold, *there commeth one after me*, whose shooes of his feete I am not worthy to loose.

here, it seems pretty obvious to me that he's equating saul *from the tribe of benjamain* with himself, because God removed/rejected him and wanted instead someone after his own heart, from the line of david. -- therefore, we can read the parallel: the egyptian served for 40 years (as [the gravestone for tiberius pantera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Julius_Abdes_Pantera) says), he then gets sidelined by God so that david/jesus can come to power -- which is then a parallel to john preaching in the wilderness to announce the arrival of jesus. what do you think?

#### 2023-04-25 01:22 - the implications of this

the obvious implications of this is that jesus (the messiah), from the line of david is always going to a narrative constructed by the romans. what he's saying there, and I have to agree, is that every 1k years or so, there's a JtB/saul figure that shows up, but ultimately the jews/isrealites/prophets will reject him, as he's not the one "after their own heart" and tthen, there's this (I call it a split) where they go off and have their fantasy messiah perform all the same symbols, in a sort of time resonance, however, the symbols will be suitable for the romans (God) to use for their next narrative.

in some way, shape, or form, the narrative that they're constructing will always come to represent whatever they think the adience wants to hear. the bible has 4 narratives that tell the same story, tailored to different people, -- but in the future, the narratives, will likely (because of computers and AI stuff) be custom tailored to each individual; everyone will see what they want to see.

obviously, that creates for a lot of confusion, cause everyone is seeing a slightly different angle on the same narrative, which means that their effort to keep everyone satisfied with a bunch of conflicting altered narratives will eventually fall apart. the last thing they'll want is for people to be able to communicate effectively amongst each other. lies, separation and barriers between humans (exemplified by wars, diplomatic borders, and disagreements) will always be necessary to keep up the narrative going.

yes, so you can see pretty easily the original problem here is religion in general, and -- their desire to keep these narratives going as a way to keep people placated. it comes from disempowerment: we all believe that we're all so insignificant that we need something greater than ourselves to believe in because we can't believe in ourselves.
it's OK though, because if we taught children (like I was taught) to just believe in yourself cause that's what mom, dad, or society expects from you -- then, when something goes wrong, because beilef in oneself isn't everything, you'll have (like I did) a chance to figure out why you actually believe in yourself -- and then you can prove *to yourself* that you are who you believe you are. (belief isn't everything, because reality is a reflection of your concepts about the world, which are formed out of *how you feel* + your beliefs)
therefore, it's quite OK to have a bunch of petty morons telling everyone to believe their nonsense. it won't be long until people aren't falling for their nonsense anymore. learning for oneself what a person *wants to believe* ( the blue pill) is always better than getting ttold and blindly believing what someone else *tells you to believe*.

### 2023-04-25 02:34 - thory: jesus = theudas?

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/U_JiSKIkFkI?t=2057)

in that account of joesephus (JA 20 169-172), felix attacks the egyptian and kills 400 men. compare that now to acts 5:36:

  36 For before these dayes rose vp Theudas, boasting himselfe to be some body, to whom a number of men, *about foure hundred*, ioyned themselues: who was slaine, and all, as many as obeied him, were scattered, & brought to nought.
  37 After this man rose vp Iudas of Galilee, in the dayes of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: hee also perished, and all, euen as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.

the next verse there must be the same as the "robbers" in galilee from josephus' text as well.

### 2023-04-25 16:38 - mutual disempowerment

I just woke up from a dream where in it the boys disempowered the girls in some way with a myth (it was unclear what), and so this naturally garnered a response to disempower the boys back (from the girls). I woke up because I strongly disagree with this and whenever my mind starts to think critically about what's happening in the dream, I wake up (kinda like that in real-life, too).

anyway, it's a very common thing to disempower someone (not even with a myth) over something that *needs* to get done: (as in "the end justifies the means") for example, I *need* to got laundry (or any other task) done, so I want to limit their (usually the kids) capability to behave in a way which will hinder my getting the task done. let's just take that example actually...
I've been bringing up various things lately that make it look like I manipulated aspects of the world in order to reach the point I'm at right now in time, but if I did the "right way" (using LOA) I wouldn't have ever disempowered anyone at all -- instead, I'd have given people bad ideas of how to empower theirselves (through conditions, conflicts, or a sense of superiority), and then *they* would have run with my bad ideas alone, and done it all theirselves. I wouldn't have ever disempowered anyone directly to accomplish my goal; everyone is always so willing to disempower theirselves for some reason (including myself).
real power, comes through how one feels about their situation: if I make an illusion that present conditions are not the way I (or they) want them to be, and then make it seem like they're the one that should feel bad for the conditions (especially the ones they can't control), that disempowerment is *entirely on them* (global warming is a great example of this).
so, getting back to the example here: the reason why the kids (or whomever) is making my task difficult for me, *has nothing to do with them*, but *only* has to do with me. all tthings are attracted based on the way I feel about things, and how I conceptualise my world... so, therefore, let's say I'm trying to do that task and something is "hindering me" -- it's more like I believe I'm being hindered by something, and so therefore they're presently comporting exactly to the specification of my myths/beliefs.
if I want the conditions preventing my task to improve, I could try and manipulate conditons by disempowering things that are preventing me: make a few laws perhaps: "no children in the laundryroom while I'm doing laundry" -- but children aren't robots, but more like mostly-pure reflections, until they get older and and are taught to behave like someone else (actor), or taught how to behave for theirselves (fool,gold); therefore, they're always going to behave pretty closely to one's expectations/beliefs (within their capacity to do so). adults are obviously more complicated because they are almost all actor/charactors, and almost never reflectors.
so what ends up happening is that we think we need to create narratives/sequences/codes/programs/protocol for how things should work to avoid disaster (most commonly seen in workplace), and that's supposed to solve the problem, but it just increases resistance because then we're trying so hard to follow protocol/syntax for the operation, that we're using up a lot of that creative brainpower to follow the protocol, instead of receiving creative impulses, cause it's those creative impulses that cause humans (especially kids!) to misbehave and operate improperly.
therefore, let me disempower *you* and make sure *you* avoid doing something that *I'm* attracting. I'm only disempowering *myself* when I do that, and that's why *I'm* so tired and worn out all the time.

#### 2023-04-25 17:11 - some examples

> I don't want you to have X, cause you aren't behaving the way I want you to behave.

the hebrew bible is filled with examples like these: for example saul does not completely exterminate the neighbours like YHVH wants, so YHVH sends evil spirits to torment saul while david is moved into place to take over kingship from saul (one example).
domestic examples abound as well: "I don't want you to go drinking with your buddies because you're not there for me" or "I don't want you to have lunch with such a guy, cause it looks like you're cheating on me" -- endless examples, too numerous to enumerate even a fraction of them.

> you need to behave X way so that that Y can go smoothely.
