### 2023-04-22 05:14 - quick theory

so continuing on my idea of venus and the idea that the symbols that are happening here on earth are (received and retransmitted through the emotional/conceptual framework of saturn) over to annother earth (vega) -- right, and so imagine that a guy is here and he does a whole bunch of stuff which causes a lot of problems (kinda like me) ... OK, I'll tell the story the other way around: imagine for a moment that you're on another earth and your earth has this guy that's walking around saying and writing all of these outlandish things -- and something like trying to understand someone talking to you while you're half-asleep, their words are influencing your dream, and they're telling you things that are partially part of the dream, yet also partially what they're trying to ttell you.
imagine for a moment that everyone on the other earth is experiencing those symbols a little bitt differently because tthey have slightly different concepts/interpretions for those symbols/form/architypes and the operations that are happening between them.
I'll give an example: zaryn called me a few weeks ago and asked me if I wanted to go to spain and hang out with him and talk about his conspiracy theories about us living in a sort of simulation. I balked at tthe idea a bit and wrote my thoughts on it a bit. I believe the way it got interpretted by some is that I kinda made light of situation -- or, I don't know how to explain it, because so many people took our conversations with him and mom (along with the things I wrote) to mean a pretty wide diversity of things. some people felt I was making fun of him, others that I was boasting, etc. the next day, someone posted a [TA game that they casted](https://youtu.be/sczG7pnfBRo) where someone who appeared to be losing, ran in d-gunned down a bunch of stuff with his commander, then proceeded to win the game. at the end of it all, he decided to write the guy a poem. well, the conclusion to my whole zaryn epic was [an epic poem](/ideas/lord-of-the-throne.md) called "lord of the throne" where I translated his top-down energy for a game based off of TA (called BAR), into a project that I thoughtt better fit his style; it was almost as if the symbols that had played out in the previous few days got somehow encapsulated into a game between two players, which then I would watch.

to understand the idea, we need to take a look at the idea of time and resonances. I literally just wrote a thing where I explained [what the symbolic realm "looks like"](/sledge-notes.md#2023-04-22-0037---thoth-vs-venus) from an emitter and reflector's perspective. I have so much more to write on the subject, so for now the simple example we can use here is to think of words as having a sort of frequency because they have a symbol. those symbols are sort of like "chords" in a music. like, just imagine you're the you're the youth pastor and you barely know how to play guitar: so you just play 3-5 different major chords and sing to jesus with passion -- and that's good enough. right, well, those chord sequences are kind of like activations for different aspects of a symbol. they don't need to be exactly the super high frequency symbol itself, but the physical sound from the instrument and the words being sung, produce a feeling which is in some way harmonic of the symbolic archetype.
OK, so now let's try the other direction: imagine for a moment that the historical jesus is playing a play here on earth and, let's say it's one of those satyricon stories -- well, the audience that's watching the play is turning those symbols into a feeling wich then resonates with those archetypal symbols. when those symbols are activated here because of our concepts, they're then relayed out to vega, where they're presented into the very fabric of the neuma reality there on vega. when that happens, some people (depending on their concepts) see a literal tomb -- and other people, see a butthole (cause that's what they assocate with that symbol: like shakespere, lol).
so anyway, what ends up happening here on physical earth is symbolically lived out and experienced by other people in vega as a reflection of their own concepts. each person there experiences my story differently and as a reflection of their concepts. so now applying my example back to the historical jesus: what you'll have is a real physical guy that lived here and a whole bunch of stuff happened to him, but ultimately those events are going to be received and interpretted by each individual as a reflection of their concepts and symbols: so for example, if I'm playing a game of TA, the symbols will play out there; or, if I'm used to shakespere's symbols, kenny's actions are going to look very shakespere-esque.

the thing is, that because of how frequencies work, shakespere 400y in the future of the death of historical jesus can influence the rendering of those symbols during the time of the actual death. therefore, all of the varying different stories of the expereince of jesus occurred and were experienced simultaneously and are all going to be directly influenced by symbols and motivfs of the literary works that the experiencer has engaged in. therefore, literary works and the poet of today is shaping how future generations will perceive the symbols experienced here on earth; and, likewise the symbols and motives/motifs that are produced here, are the realities that are attracted here. what I mean, is the 3 days motif of agamemnon's body, and 3d of tomb sex, etc. are creating the form into which the neuma of the idea will take shape here (to say it in thoth terms).
the beauty of this whole ordeal is that *I* get to see the symbols however I want to, and so does everyone else. they and all of their literary workes create the symbols which manifest in my reality, and att the same time, you all get to experience the symbols the way that you all want to: some people will see the generalised action (like "pulls out big dick moves, then writes a poem") while others will see specifics. it's all really nice from my perspective. once you understand thoth (coming soon), it'll all make sense how awesome it is.
