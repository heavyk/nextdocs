### either I can do it, or I can't
- those are literally 100% of the options
- however, reducing all of the other peripheral stuff to see only those two options, is the hard part: I either believe in myself, or I don't.
### I don't find helping people makes me very happy
- for me, my happiness is directly proportional to my capacity to like myself.
- if I don't like myself, no amount of helping others can ever make me happy.
- happiness comes from within, and what's within, is me, so hopefully I like that.
- I notice that the things that I really like about other people, I also like those things about myself
- really, I'm just noticing things I like about me in others, and seeing more of myself out there makes me happy.

- going from having to coerce someone into saying yes -> being able to say no (gold, when it's being attracted stronger, puts out a repulsive force).
- keeping success at arm's length
