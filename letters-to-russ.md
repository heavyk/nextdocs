# letters to russ allen

I decided that I'm not likely going to ever send any of these letters ever, but I do enjoy writing them, so I figured for now he can just be my invisble pen pal (or muse -- whatever).

if he reads them someday, cool; if he doesn't, that's also cool, too. I don't know how much I'll be "personal" -- but it doesn't really matter. nobody is going to read them anyway...

the point is, to discuss thoughts that his podcast inspires me to think about; nothing more. it's kind of nice because often times I think about later things I should have said differently or wanted to say better, so in those cases, I may try to correct some stuff -- but then again, I may not, too. I've been known to get things wrong, so I'll just get them wrong at my leisure, here instead. OH WELL...

### 2022-03-26 08:49 - thoughts on missing 411

I just binge-listened to all of the 411 sodes in a single night and I would like to relate that I experience a number of these sorts of effects on a semi-regular basis.

I may or may not send out this "email" -- TBD at a later time...

anyway, I've had an extensive relationship with brambles and blackberries for a time when I lived in spain. I built a fort in the middle of a ravine(?) (arroyo) and spent a lot of hanging out there. the bushes have an incredible quality of intelligence to them which I do not experience other plants to have. the branches have a pentagonal shape to them and that's what gives them their incredible flexibility and strength. they build massive structures by building upon theirselves and then drying out the bottom part. it is possible to clear out the bottom layers and have essentially a bramble structure with columns and a roof just by clearing the dried part.

I always had scratches all over my body, so I wouldn't have noticed scratches to be out of place. later however, when I moved back to colorado, I noticed that many mornings I woke up with scratches all over. these scratches were always to disguise a dull aching below the skin where "they" would put microscopic (nano) "inserts" under my skin.

I also experienced a lot of the "missing time" experiences when I would go out to a field and "watch stars" -- this is a technique I rediscovered from where we get the word "staring" which is to fixate a star into the centre of the vision and then relax and allow an expansion of the visual space. it greatly increases the production of DMT and with extended lengths of holding the star in the centre while in a relaxed state, you will experience hyperbolic geometry and fractal patterns similar to an ayahuasca, DMT, or "shrooms" experience.

in these states, I go into a state of mind very remeniscent of what most of the young girls experienced in the 411 cases. I interact with beings and "concepts" that are very difficult to explain with physical attributes. I don't actually "see" them. this state of mind is entirely perceived on the conceptual plane (I can describe all of these things with physical attributes and colours, but I don't actually "see" any visual information).

this lack of visual capacity has existed since my "imagination" was completely shut down when I had a brain haemorrhage in my pre-motor cortex near the top of the right hemisphere -- where the brain creates the desire to move. I should be a vegetable, but instead I make reality really quickly.

these "star-watching" experiences are interesting because I used to lose consciousness all the time. from time to time though, I wouldn't lose consciousness, and I was stuck in a black nothing where I couldn't move my body (very similar to sleep paralysis), and I could lay and relax and what felt like a turbulant motion was draining my entire body of the energy that I had been receiving from the star. I could fight it to return to consciousness, and when I did, I came back and my entire body was numb and without feeling with this prickley sensation all over it (reminds me of marty's ufo encounters). I was also unreasonably cold -- a deep biting cold down in the muscles down to the bones (opposite from cold weather going from skin down to muscle, and hypothermia and stiffness is when it starts to reach the bones).

from time to time, I would "push through" on the experience and I would begin to feel a warm sensation all over my body and the pricklyness would increase just like happens when you "die" or enter into a NDE (it's related to an increase in DMT production). when that happened, suddenly, as if by magic, my paralysis and the blackness would lift and I would find myself back in the body. usually though, I did not regain or retain consciousness through the experience and it was just "missing time". without checking my phone a lot (total buzzkill for the star experience), I couldn't reliably tell you how much time was lost -- but judging by how far the stars moved in the sky, it could be anything from minutes to entire hours.

whether I lost consciousness or not, often times when trying to stand up rapidly after the stars, I would be very out of balance, unable to walk in a straight line. a few seconds with bent legs and I could regain my ability to stand and then everything back to normal again in a few minutes. now, I don't lose consciousness anymore. instead, what happens, is the "kundalini" begins to rise at the base of the spine... I stop it though (see mantak chia for explanation of the cosmic orgasm), and it keeps starting lower and lower. first legs, then shins, then heels, now the arches of my feet. it's rising so rapidly now that I don't even need to watch stars. I just directly feel the "kundalini" rise when there is a c-flare. if there's an m-flare, I'm having trouble to stay in my body, and I haven't experienced an x-flare yet. the last few days have been very difficult to sleep and a reduced apetite.

I forgot to mention... one time (can't remember if I lost consciousness), I manifested ants in the middle of winter after watching stars. another time live scorpions (in cold weather). I've also seen it happen if I sit in the sun especially a vibrant sun in the winter (snow ants).

I've lost consciousness a lot, and again, this happened to me a lot when I was in spain. I would drink a little bit, like have maybe one cup or a beer and it would activate that pre-motor cortex and I would have happen where "reality would manifest very rapidly" -- like I could *feel* (remember, I don't have visual), the room getting calmer, and it would. if I felt myself levitating -- I lost consciousnss. I thought that was the alcohol at first, but now that I'm doing it consciously, I'm certain that it's related to the same reason for the "missing time" while star-watching.

in that state of mind, everything that I felt became a reality, very quickly. oh, did I mention that water is a very efficient carrier of this solar energy (chi or vril), and a "babbling brook" can easily induce this state of mind. for simplicity I'll call it the conceptual state of perception.

in this state of mind, everything that you feel reflects in reality very rapidly. in past times, I'd call this the "garden of eden" -- as I think that's literally the state of mind that adamu was in during that time -- it's related to the brain stem and the pre-motor cortex. every thing just feels natural there.

have you ever noticed that crazy crazy stuff could be happening in a dream and it all feels "normal"? I was not alarmed by the scorpion or the ants. they felt natural to be there -- then, my logical brain kicked in and I felt very strange about their presence, but in the creation process, I felt completely at ease and normal, as if they were supposed to be there.

---

OK, now that I've laid the foundation of where I'm coming from, I'd like to see if I can give my explanation to these occurances.

it's hard to separate the two because I have many experiences where that switch flips, and all of a sudden I'm creating reality fast -- and levitation and bilocation is a thing.. I don't know if those girls were bilocating or levitating, as that seems a very plausible thing to me in my realm of experience. the unexplainable items are also fine to me, as in that state of mind, if you feel you want or need something and have no resistance to it (I'm lost or I have no one to give it to me), then you just create those things and situations. it was often times difficult to separate my imagination and "reality" -- much like a very young child has a very difficult time making concrete sense of what is "real" just yet.

for me all of these experiences can easily be explained with that conceptual (garden of eden) state of mind.

---

so while I can explain the 411 as a manifestation of the conceptual plane of perception, there are numerous details in these stories that suggest something else may be happening.

often times when I enter into these states, the temperature drops very rapidly (see below section) -- and, like I said, I have to be very careful to *not* allow the kundalini to rise or to not leave my body, start levitating, because if I don't I lose consciousness. 

what I believe is happening is these people are just very sensetive people, like I am, and what happens is some event allows them to enter into this state. it often times happens to me when I'm left alone, relaxed, and around water. mountains, granite, gold, and shining crystals also have this effect on me. I figure these are all the trigger to them then entering into this state.

I've developed my capacity quite well, so I navigate the conceptual plane very well, but your average person will not. like me at the beginning, I was swayed by any feeling that was put into my perception. I could easily be steered into a river, away to a remote location where I would lose time and then be "adjusted" back into physical plane.

whoever "they" are, they do not want my to experience any other reality than the physical (I don't even have an imagination). for now, I'll just call them the custodians because they insist that I stay focused on the mundane physical experience.

there is a very major clue as to who "they" are because of the overwhelming number of blonde children that are abducted. the other major clue is that the FBI gets involved so frequently.

what I believe has happened, is "they" have made an agreement with the USA allowing for testing and abduction on the citizens in exchange probably for technology. the FBI is there to ensure that no evidence is ever found which can trace back to "them".

I believe clothing is always lost because a person like me (or any clairvoyant or remote viewer) can use the clothing to "tune into" the situation. it's interesting the one situation of the woman in the tree that the clairvoyant explained where she would be.

I believe that their goal is to do non-harmful tests and release the person back to reality. if that weren't the case, I wouldn't be able to write this. I may get into trouble with the US govt, but not them (they appear to have very powerful influence over the US govt).

I noticed in the cases where the person has extensive search parties for them and the searches don't give up, the person is found dead. however, if the searches give up, then I think the victim is released back into the wilderness, and then natural desire will cause someoene to just "happen" or "by chance" go to look where the victim is. this is basic "law of attraction" stuff. if you keep looking at the dire situation, it gets worse, but if you let go and allow the solution, it shows up.

also in marty's UFO reports, you notice a similar thing. they're not aggressing. they may pull some hotshot stunts (like the game of chicken), but most all actions have been reactions.

the cases down in south america (brazil?) where people were killed or left in an incapacitated state around energetic locations, looks not to be "them" but actually the US govt. I believe "they" gave the US govt the technology to manipulate people's minds (the network) and also UFO craft technology.

from my own experience, "they" are behaving according to the "law of attraction" and so, as such, sure I lose consciousness, but they don't bother me, and I'm well advanced in my capacities. I just have to stay away from the astral plane (4d) and the conceptual plane (5d) and everything is fine...

---

I can hear your reactions to that last bit already... lol, I believe the reason for it is larger than you may think. in the astral plane, your imagination with a little bit of focus will manifest itself in 3d space. you (and others on the astral) can see it and interact with these images. they can be anything from "astral records" (secrets, etc) to demons or angels, or anything you can "see" in your imagination.

in numerous "end times" prophecies, it talks about all of these demons that interact with and terrorise humankind. well, they not real demons, until "you" focus them into this reality enough to interact with you.

when I was younger, I would walk outside and my fears would mainifest theirselves as shadow creatures and jump out at me (especially in the dark or low sleep), so it was quite a relief to me to not see my imagination anymore after the haemorrhage. now, I'm quite good at feeling the way I want to feel, so I find it very unilikely that anything that I would feel would have any lasting negative effect on my environment. in fact, I can pretty much guarantee that only good-feeling things would make their way into manifestation.

at this point, because I've quit star-watching, the sun completely controls when the "kundalini" will rise. I can basically feel any way I want to now, so as my focus (on wanted) continues to improve, this transition will be seamless for me. there will no longer be any way for me to lose consciousness.

that is the state of "effortless power" because anything I focus on (feel and tune to) will manifest instantly. we all have the capability to do it, and the goal is to manifest what's wanted rather than demons and catastrophes for others to experience.

in the larger scheme of things, I believe this manifestation of "them" and their prevention of humankind's (or, at least my) access to the conceptual (5d) form of perception is a reflection of the age old brotherhood initiations: first, you gatta want it, and then you gatta "earn" it.

for me, it's not a mantra, a breathing technique, drugs, sex, or focus on a star -- though those do work. instead, this is about the ability to focus reliably on what's wanted. instant manifestation is a pretty big deal and personally I don't want dead fish and scorpions raining from the sky. though, I don't know what other people are looking for.

book, written.

SNAKES!!



---

the other thing that I noticed is that storms occur around me frequently. so does exceptionally sunny or clear weather. it's almost always an interaction between the way I feel and those around me feel.

if I cause someone to have a strong negative emotional reaction, a storm rapidly forms, and on occasion it'll begin to snow or rain with a cloudless sky.

conversly, if I feel exceptionally good, it could be raining all around and where I'm at, it'll be sunny and often very windy. you can verify this by looking at the historical radar images for pueblo, colorado (where I am now). the reason why the wind blows is because that good feeling (chi) will warm up the atmosphere (just like the warmth after a solar flare), and the machines that they use to neutralise that energy cause pockets of cold to rapidly form, causing strong wind (look up the correlation of snow in pueblo in relation to solar flares).

==================================

### 2022-03-28 22:05 - thoughts on sign and the seal

hey russ, I had some thoughts on the sign and the seal. there were a few parts that caught my attention.

#### the shamir duck

the duck is black and the "beak" is red. I would guess that this almost certainly refers to a red (phonecian/cairo) paternal bloodline and a black (khemit) maternal bloodline.

symbolically, I think the original "black" culture was up in upper egypt (elephantine) are the feminine/matriarchal which were then (probably aroud the time of narma/menes) became the white bowling-pin hats, while the reds retained the cairo region.

#### friday the 13th

in this section the french rounded up all of the templars and accused them of a lot of things. I remembered in a robert sepehr video that he mentioned they were accused of homosexual activity -- and I think that's what the extended pause was about. anyway, I could feel your despicable feeling when talking about how the french essentially destroyed a beneficial economic system and gave the money back to the rich.

those institutions are run by "fallen angels" -- people that have their own communication system on the astral plane. they see in 4d, hence the reference to hight, width, breath, and depth (when you get astral vision you'll see the extra space. it's unmistakable. anyway, they can astrally project, able to leave their bodies and travel around anywhere on the planet, listen in on conversations (they knew where they were going) and what to expect when arriving. colombus was a crypto jew etc, an immigration of the "red" paternal bloodline. (see robert sepehr for more info on this).

so, it's quite likely (I believe) that they were engaged in homosexual activity, and so the condemnation was probably accurate, but it is unfortunate that it's condemable in the first place.

#### chi/orgone energy and the ark

the ark of the covenant is setup like an organic accumulator. it has layers of harmonically (or perhaps octave) resonant spaces of organic and inorganic material, housed in the "holy of holies" which will have to be spatially resonant as well.

each layer attracts this energy (of it's spatial capacity) and then repels the non spatially resonant. if electricity is the science of energy moving through time (frequencies), orgone energy is the science of energy moving through space. this energy is always moving, but the way I figure, this energy is the "return phase" -- so think of electricity as leaving it's source and having a wavelength and frequency. it goes out and dissipates because of resistance (transforms into heat because of the resistance) and it's at that time when it "dissipates" that the energy finds its path of least resistance to return back to its source (the sun).

if you're familiar with "a dweller on two planets", I'm referring to the "navaz" or "night-side" when it's returning back to its source. this energy is attractive, and it is assured to arrive back to the sun. so, the goal is to "collect" or "accumulate" this orgone energy.

orgone can be created with thoughts and emotions. thoughts create emotions. notice that everything that you think, you will get a very small response to it that is interpretted as "no that's not right" or "that sounds good" -- "intuition" they call it, but really it's just resonance between two ideas.

accumulation and transmission of this solar energy will have dramatic effects on your reality. things that you believe and things that you feel will become manifest rather rapidly. the reason why they had to protect it from the layity is because most people feel and think a lot of things that slowly kill them (we call this living). this energy is the energy of the "great presever" or the vishnu aspect of the godhead (hence why he's called the "sun of god").

#### the "secret" to the shamir

the movement of chi or orgone can be done with various techniques, including that of breathing, but the most efficient/potent is sexually. both males and females have the "equipment" for the tranmission and reception of this energy. analgous to the "tesla coil" is the penis/clitoris, and analogous to the "magnifying transmitter" is the prostate/uterus.

think of these things (whether breathing or interacting with someone else) as a transformer of that energy. when I say "inhale" you can imagine any sort of repeption of energy, and exhale the opposite.

normal transformers have two coils: the primary and the secondary. tesla did a lot of experiements with a three coil setup though. if you only inhale and exhale, you will ultimately hyperventilate, so let's consider instead the poitive (exhale), negative (inhale) and neutral (rest) states.

when inhaling, the primary coil is the air outside you and the secondary is the air inside you. exhaling is the opposite, and your mind is the third coil. it comes into "rest" or resonance with the signal it received.

this practise is very easy when solo as you only have the focus of your own mind to worry about, however consider the case where engaged with a partner. their energy will inevitably be slightly different than your own. after inhaling, it's time to rest into it and become resonant with their energy before exhaling again.

knowing that, and a little bit of experimentation, you'll see it's pretty easy to amplify this energy. life will get a lot faster and everything manifests (your thoughts and feelings become reality much faster), so it's good to be conscious of ones velocity and direction and take the appropriate concerns to not self-destruct.

#### final note

I brougt up the "fallen angels" bit because it would seem logical to me that the perpetrators of the friday the 13th were the same power hungry guys that went there, but moved to different bodies. this puts a whole new perspective on solomon's "wise" decision to send the firstborn sons. I suspect he must have known their true nature, and he was essentially moving them and the ark down to ethiopia.

your comparison of solomon to comte st. germain was probably pretty accurate.

warm regards,
kenny

### 2022-04-26 00:31 - technology and dreams

listening to #008 now and you're talking about cell phones and dreams. this is absolutely not at all true for me.

when I was younger I would play games in my dreams and believe I also could program computers in my dreams too (something I hadn't yet learned how to do in real-life) -- so that's kind of weird. I tried many different times to learn to program computers but I couldn't figure it out until I had a brain haemorrhage when I was 16. since then, programming was really easy for me.

after that I definitely programmed in my dreams and operated computers all of the time. in fact, just the other day I was reading something on my phone that was really insightful (I have a desire to learn about something, then the answer will show up to me somehow in dream or physical reality). anyway, someone didn't want me reading that so the phone then got garbled and incomprehensible. I returned the phone back to a readable state and resumed reading, then the scene switched and it was something new. I wanted to read what was on the phone so badly, I woke myself up from the dream.

a similar occurance happened also recently where I was reading some eoteric document on the computer that I'm writing this now, and again I felt as if someone didn't want me to read it, after that I can't remember what happened, but I would like to mention that not only was the text very clear, but it was 3d and had a depth to it that I don't normally see on my screen (I'm writing this in vscode, and the letters had this parallax effect to them because they were spatial -- also the blue border around it was more vibrant and kind of alive and responsive to my thoughts a bit).

---

I would also like to mention tesla's account in his autobiography where he talks about having mastered sleeping, and he too would desire to understand a solution to a something puzzling him, so he would induce a sleep state and find the answer to his question in the dream.

I would say that if you desire to know the solution of a programming difficulty or some other technical thing, you *will* dream about it. so, I don't know if you still don't dream about tech, but you can if you want to.

anecdotally, I'd also like to relay an experience that I had one time when I ate way too many fresh mushrooms which is a very different experience than dried because, still containing a lot of the essence of the mushroom, I think more like the mushroom does rather than how I think... anyway, I tried to use my phone while on these fresh mushrooms, and the text was totally garbled to me, I couldn't read it and I couldn't figure out how to use the phone. using a computer also proved to be quite difficult as well.

with time, however, I did train myself to be able to program pretty well on mushrooms, and I would say that they are actually pretty compatible.

what it is (I believe), is that the active chemical in the dream and the shrooms (DMT) makes a compatibility layer between your brain's form of perception and what I call the conceptual world. the reason why I couldn't understand the phone was because I had assumed (was tuned to) the consciousness of the mushroom, and so from the perspective of the mushroom, the phone is entirely incomprehensible.

I don't know if my later efforts to program actually taught the mushroom how to program, but you could imagine that from the mushroom's perspective, they "see" and experince things through the nervous systems of those that have ingested their form of perception. the psilocybin molecule is essentially DMT with an extra phosphorus, and so the mushroom has come up with an ingenius way to hyrdrolyse its consciousness into DMT which has passed the blood-brain barrier, and so then it can share its consciousness with any mammal that has consumed it. mushrooms are cool :)

anyway, it appears that a person's DMT tunes them into their "conceptual world" and this seems to be interfaced with in the dream-state through the astral world (the world between the two). so, the places where you have a compatible interface for the concepts, those things will exist. what I'm saying is that if my childhood memory is correct, it's strange to think that my concept world was already capable of programming digital things and that I attracted my brain haemorrhage as a result.

---

a side anecdote further "proving" my supposition that the dream-state is the astral world and that the astral world is a mix of the conceptual and the physical (also called the imaginary world)... I've also read books in my dreams, and books are a bit of a different experience as well. the best way I can describe it is with a book: "dweller on two planets". in it, book 2 I believe, walter pierson's trip to hysperia, phyris gives him a device that allows him to see what was in the author's mind when they wrote the book, poem, etc...  for me, some books are a very vivid experience containing sensation and visuals (like that story says is happening in the astral), while other books, it feels like the entire concept is fully understood and I'm exploring the concept with the author as I read the text.

that's all for now... gonna go listen to the rest of the podcast now!

cheers

### 2022-04-26 05:24 - guardian angels and the unseen

OK, few responses to the previous letter. first, when I was talking about the visuals in vscode, I may have been mixing two things -- a dream and a real-life experience. I'm fairly certain that I did read something on this computer (it's weird how now I'm not so sure I drempt of reading things on this computer, though I seemed convinced of it at the time). however, there was another time in real-life too where something happened (solar flare? I dunno) and I started to gain 4d (astral) perception while I was reading on this computer. I did notice that in 4d when I would move my head really rapidly, before the "proper" image of what I was seeing replaced my vision, the text did have that parallax effect of the letters having an extra dimension (this happens a lot when playing games on the phone as well).

anyway, this doesn't discount from many experiences where I am reading things. I do definitely read things -- and thinking about it later, I'm not really sure how I read in dreams, because it's not usually the case that I "see" anything. it's black but the space is moving around and I seem to have some knowledge of what is happening even though I don't "see" it (as in, no image is in my eyes to look at).

this whole idea of seeing things without anything visible happens to me all the time, and it I think it could be happening here as well. for me, this is the "conceptual" (or spiritual, depending on your definition of "spiritual") world and it's largely composed of very abstract ideas. when I focus on them, they do take on form, and the form or skin that they put on is usually the most recent interaction with that concept (which best describes it). like, if it were a car, it would be the last car I saw (something tesla also mentioned in his autobiography), or the best ("perfect") representation of a concept in physical form.

these things that I interact with are real to me, and they are probably the same thing as imaginary friends are for kids. I haven't been around kids in a while but I am the oldest of 5 so I did previously have experience interacting with kids, and I believe that my acquired form of perception is very similar to children's perception. I learned it by "releasing resistance", or finding a way to perceive (conceptualise, rationalise, find logic for) something that does not feel good (the not feeling good part is the eviedence of resistance).

so, when I said in the previous letter that "someone didn't want me to ..." -- it's the same to me if that resistance is coming externally or internally. in fact it's almost always true that things that bother me about something external, are the same things that I don't like about myself -- and my attempts to fix other people are really my efforts to fix myself (through other people). so -- what I'm saying there is that it doesn't matter to me if there really is someone micromanaging my dreams -- like maybe a "guardian angel" or something, that resistance affects my dreams because I resonate with that resistance.

as an example, I said that in one of the dreams I was reading some esoteric thing in the dream and then "someone" didn't want me reading that, so they manipulated the dream -- well, from my perspective, that "someone" not wanting me to look outside of myself or to esoteric documents for the answer is *me*. it's myself, and my own resistance that is producing this effect in the dream. so, when I look at the dream from an even more conceptual point of view, the dream is telling me that everything I'm looking for *is* inside of me, but I'm still clinging on to things (outside of myself) that I think will give me the answer I'm looking for.

---

it's weird how this connects to the second part of that podcast because you were relating sleep paralysis in dreams. I have only experienced sleep paralysis a few times, and it's a struggle to get back to get my body moving again, however, I never really experienced the buzzing sound or any of that. I mentioned in a previous letter (the one about the 411) my experiences out on the field where I would be unable to move, my vision is black and when I finally come back, I have that tingling feeling all over my body and I feel very weak (as if all of the energy in my body had been drained). my sleep paralysis is much more like that -- and I've never had a presence. though, I will mention that when I was a kid, fear (so this all seems to be related to desire) would produce apparitions in 3d space that I could see. I would audibly hear my name being called, and I often times felt a dark awful presence near to me.

it was either an astral entity or it was something that my own mind had conjured -- though, I will say for certain that I only experienced it because I was tuned to it and desired their presence -- meaning, I felt fear and feared them interacting with me. nowadays, I would say that all of these manifestations were attracted by me, and if they weren't real astral entities, they were definitely my own creations.

over time, like tesla in his autobiography, I learned to control them with my desire and they produced such intense fear in me, but I figurd out that they were all in my own head -- so like, when I had to take the trash out at night, I would go out and my body would be trembling, but my brain was calm because I knew it was all in my own head.

many years later, I discovered drugs (mushrooms and MDMA) and I found out that in these states of mind *anything* can be discovered and any answer can be found. there were these little gnomes that I would interact with that I called the "reality technicians" that could answer any question that I had with this swirling ball of light and colour -- that, upon seeing it, I would experience the answer, in its entirety, in an instant. very cool. we all have this, and to access it is a simply desiring it (losing fear) without resisting it. if you haven't experienced this yet, I genuinely desire that you do. it'd be cool to hear about it sometime.

---

switching gears here, I noticed the theme of the guardian angels. have you ever read "oahspe"? it's a massive tome that marty brought up on UFO's (part 9) and I downloaded it to see what he's talking about. I've read a lot of it, but it mentions in the very first creation myth, jehovih is making a place for a number of angels (previously present in other civilisations, presumably present in this galaxy) to exist here on earth. they are put on earth with the first version of "man" and they comingle with man and create children that have eternal souls (the angels do not)... that earth gets destroyed and a new earth is created (kyle calls them solar regimes) and the first one is "pan" (a continent in pacific) and there is again another "tree" and a "serpent".

well, it alternates the trees (life and knowledge), but it's clear (to me at least) that this "serpent" is the kundalini and the tree is one of hemispheres of the brain -- and these mark the phases of brain development for "man"...

anyway after the serpent convinces them to one of the trees again, jehovih assigns these angels from the previous garden (in etheric) to become "guardian angels" to prevent the humans from ever getting back into this garden of "eden". interestingly, the book describes eden as being "a heavenly place", so the implication is that these guardian angels (which reside in the astral, "lower heavens" can take on physical form) and are designed to prevent us from ever getting back into this heavenly place and to realise that we are eternal beings. it's all very weird, but you can see the echos of the other myths in there.

so we get now to the part that marty brought up with the "false osiris". he convinces the humans to yet another tree and garden failure (this time though with the knowledge of good and evil), and so then now that we're able to perceive good and evil (further evidence this serpent and tree is not a physical thing), this false osiris decides that now he can split himself into the lord of the earth and god of the sky. so, now he's designing his own version of good and evil for the people, so together with anubis (the dog), they create the "brotherhood" to teach people the "good" through ritual and sacrifice. he then has thothma (who believes he is the reincarnation of the previous non-false "God" thoth) to build the pyramids.

the description they talk about floating these stones down the nile. anyway, in the next podcast (#009) you discuss your theory that the pyramid was already there and they just recased it. tura is up the nile form cairo, so that this thothma guy is likely the "khufu" guy and cause if they're floating things down the nile, this that's not going to have overcuts and stuff. I have more thoughts on that story (which I should totally talk to marty about -- I know, I can "hear" your voice in my head) -- but that's not the point. the point is, the whole reason why osiris did this was that the pyramid would make it possible for these "guardian angels" to take on corporeal form, and rejuvenation of the body.

so, could those guardian angels be the presence that you sense in the sleep paralysis? they are literally described (by oahspe) as being lower heaven entites designed to keep us from gaining access to a portion of the brain?

I personally don't experience any looming presences or anything like that. sometimes I wake up pretty pissed off, but those are always pretty traceable to resistant things, and as I release that resistance, I no longer experience those things.

I bring that up, because earlier I mentioned kids. if their process of growing up is the process of taking on a more and more material perception of reality, they are in fact taking on resistance, by believing that material things are their source for happiness -- and that is actually what is stopping the ability to perceive this conceptual world. my theory is (it's not really theory for me, as I have tons of experience and practise with it), that all of these "evil" things may be built into our DNA (dunno if that's true or not), so it's possible we have "original sin" in that way, and the original creator god -- or jehovih caused us to be a mix of these fallen angels and perfect creation -- or whatever (that's all equal to me).

what matters is how you *perceive* your reality -- which is what you tune to. in #008, you talked about how the universe is based on information, and I have a whole theory on how these vibrating concepts attract a reality which reflects the concept. 

therefore, what I'm saying is that -- on one hand there are various texts which talk of this "force" out there designed to prevent us from ever accessing that part of our mind (I call it devachan-on-earth) -- and, on the other hand, your reality is a reflection of the concepts that *you* are, meaning that none of these forces (if they even exist) can actually harm you, if you do not resonate sympathetically with them.

you are the problem and also the solution.

I wanted to talk about one more thing but I forgot it now, so I hope this letter fostered some thought. I'll see you later.

### 2022-04-26 14:09 - the coming cataclysm

hey, so now I'm listening to #010 and you (or maybe it was kyle) mentioned the idea that the annunaki knew that a major cataclysm was coming and enlil wanted everything to go, but enki wanted to save some of the creation. well, the part about the knowing that the cataclysm is coming flashed an idea into my head where it may be more simple than that. another concept mentioned was that the cataclysms are caused by disharmonious activity of the humans and we should revert to low-energy buttflap way of living to ensure no more cataclysms (I think this was mentioned at the end of #009).

so, let's take the "giza power plant" idea that the great pyramid is taking in disharmonious earth vibrations and converting them to harmonious vibrations. I'll just assume that's the case for the rest of this letter. I'll also assume that the giza complex existed and was operational before this flood event, too.

so imagine that they've (atlantians, annunaki, whatever) built the pyramid here to transform the disharmonious vibrations in the planet (the stuff that causes earthquakes), and that this was the same technology they used on mars (referring to #007 CIA remote viewing of mars 1Mya). looking at the internals of the pyramid, they would be able to track how much close they're getting to the point of the pyramid overloading and getting more vibrational input than it can transform. this likely was the trigger for the cataclysm, and that's how they saw it coming.

regarding the impact hypothesis, if this vibration is the same vibration that creates gravity, magnets, and reality (the information theory of the universe), then we're attracting these sorts of impactors and likely also hightened solar activity as well. though I blame the sun for the cataclysm, there could have been impactors as well, but almost certainly it was the disharmonious energy of the planet that was being transformed by the pyramid machine.

another thing to think about is -- if moses knew how to use the phramid machine to amp up these vibrations to attract things, and he had access to the pyramid, it's possible that he could have used such a device to alter orbits of planets in the solar system (like mars and venus for example). the reverberations from this amplified attraction could have been the subsequent bronze age collapse, too. random thought: I've often wondered if tesla figured out how to alter the orbits of planets in the solar system, what sort of things could be done with that? in another episode, kyle talks about how time travel doesn't work because we can't even space travel... what cold be possible if the planets in this solar system could be altered, or, if the solar system's position in the galaxy. I dunno, but it's a fun thing to think about -- tuning in to a position the planets in the solar system had at some point in the past. maybe not travel there, but could you tune into a person there and see through their eyes? what if we tune into a previous position the sun had in a galaxy and see the solar system from that past position? that'd be cool right? we could watch the YD climate disaster through the eyes of the various cultures around the planet. anyway...

so back to the cataclysm. let's just say it that "noah's flood" is the beginning of the YD climate catastrophe for the sake of argument. I know it's only 6kya, but just go with the idea. let's say that the pyramid was the cause of the disaster and a number of people that retained the knowledege of how to construct pyramids survived the disaster, and they decide that they want to "make a name for theirselves" and construct another pyramid system (maybe it was in the americas), and they build up the conditions on earth again such that once again O2 levels are extremely high, conditions are good, and this time we're (the humans) are building our own version of the pyramids -- bigger and better, but nothing like the giza complex is cause the annunaki probably made that sparing no expense, highest quality.

well, same thing; disharmonious energies begin to mount in the earth and like giza, this setup is also pumping out high amounts of protons enabling elevated forms of consciousness. I call it global perception where everyone on the planet, including the animals are all tuned into, because of the harmonious vibrations the pyramids are putting out. we all have a visual (project the image into 3d space) and telepathic single conceptual language (like the "reality technicians"). the extra protons would turn lead into gold and create the ions necessary to pump out C14 and O18 to create that peak in that ice core graph that randall shows (it may not have been that much warmer but a lot more energetic shown with elevated C14 and O18).

again, the earth energies (magnetic field) builds up once again to such a high level that we once again attract a tremendous solar blast. the first time when the CME arrived, because of all of the oxygen in the air at that time, it was converted instantly into massive amounts of water (hence the difficulty breathing and extinction of megafauna). the second time though, there likely wasn't nearly as much O2, so it probably didn't cause as much water -- though there are two major "meltwater" pulses and two major spikes in O18 in the ice cores -- so, what if all of that water wasn't caused by all of that ice melting and instead was the instant conversion of solar hydrogren (not the H+ ions the pyramids are putting out which have a specific frequency which can be tuned to attract oxygen or not, but ones that will attract oxygen) into massive amounts of water and snow two times in a row.

the babel story is just the humans that knew of the technology rebuilding the network, and the "gods" get blamed for our own of these catastrophe. with the "gods" peaced out from the planet, it was probably pretty clear to the ones that retained the knowledge of this technology that the "gods" didn't cause the cataclysm -- AND, it's not a cyclical thing, because it happened twice in less than 1ky. nothing other than the reality that disharmonious vibration *attracts* these cataclysms.

---

so what is "disharmonious vibration"? well, I believe that humans and the planet emits a vibrating magnetic field. the field vibrates much faster than most instruments can detect. you won't induce an electrical signal into conductors around you until you have an imbalance.

to illustrate, go online to look at the "goes magnetic field" and notice how it looks like DC biased AC? it fluctuates around but its midpoint now is about ~80nT. a year ago, it was about ~60nT. this is an example of an imbalance. if it were balanced, the night side would have a negative (or at least no) magnetic field, but we are attracting considerably more in the direction of the sattelite. it says that is the Hp field strength (which is parallel to the spin axis). if they provided the He field, it would show the strength pointing toward the sun (which I believe is what attracts the CMEs but they don't provide that data), and there should be a sharp rise before an earth-directed CME and a let down after impact (satisfying the attraction). it's these magnetic fields that I believe are responsible for generating earthquakes and also solar outbursts. it's these magnetic fields that the pyramid is transforming into harmoniusly vibrating protons (H+ ions).

I believe those fields are created by the composite of all attraction of all living things. it's the same vibration that causes forests to attract rain as it is for us to make "attract" a significant other or a car accident into one's reality. it's the sexual/creative force -- the life essence -- the philosopher's stone.

everyone attracts whatever they desire/fear by how it feels, and how strongly they feel it. disharmonious emotion creates sudden rainstorms, earthquakes (like the mexico/germany world cup goal), and all types of things. you can only really attract for yourself though.

### 2022-04-26 15:32 - pyramid feedback loop

hey,

responding to the previous reactions: so, if you think about the idea of using technology to transform emotion into expanded perception, you kinda have a reverse runaway feedback loop. with a system like the giza complex in operation, the more pissed off, angry and violent people get, the more expanded their perception becomes; in a sense, it rewards them for feeling worse, rather than better about their circumstances.

I believe that the entire system has created (purposefully, if you think about the false osiris story) a setup that has trained many humans to react negatively to circumstances, because for most of them -- especially the "gods", the worse they felt about things the more the system would pump them (and the earth) with good-feeling vibration to compensate for the bad-feeling they're admitting.

going further into the idea, consider for yourself the story of oahspe. the head dude, jehovih is ridiculous. he's just as bad as all of the "false Gods" that get put into place.

there's a story channeled by kuthumi called "et view of creation" (see geohanover.com philosophy section) where he talks about a galaxy was created with a physical plane (obviously it's this one cause I'm writing to you in the physical) and this galaxy was designed to attract the INFECTED ONES from all over the universe. like attracts like, so I think the creator of this galaxy designed a galaxy just like jehovih and he setup all of those power structures and after sufficient throneroom meetings and power and glory displays, osiris finally had enough of his nonsense and decided to push it to the limit. the result was the human race and the pyramid -- designed to create a petrie dish with all the nutrients available in the physical plane for evil to grow and multiply until it completely takes over control over the earth. I believe that's the point.

I also believe that so much power has been given to this false osiris and his minions to create such an oppressive force that one has to learn how to *attract* what you want. there "guardian angels" running the show will always have more optimal conditions than any of us do and superior technology to ensure that nobody who actually feels good will find their connection until there is no way for them to be stopped. I figure that even if you wanted to do your own thing and you arrived to solar system levels of energy, you would still be in this galaxy, and you'd be subject to jehovih's power and glory displays -- so, in reaility, if you really want to do things another way and surpass all of these ridiculous power structures, you gatta find a way to create your own galaxy.

that's what I intend to do. don't tell anyone though :)

### 2022-04-26 15:49 - dissatisfaction guaranteed

I was in the shower this morning noticing the reactions to my comment about how I can "hear" your voice telling me to talk to marty, but I refuse. the reaction was hilarious because it painted me in the picture of one of those women that love to play "hard to get" and string a guy along for as long as possible with nothing in return. I'm not going to defend myself. guilty as charged, I guess...

OK, I'll try to defend myself somewhat... I still just don't feel at all like I want to be involved with people. I had a dream last night where there were some people interested in my new form of perception idea that I got from kyle. I totally love the idea and I'm working hard to create it. there were two parts to the dream: the first was that some powerful dudes would really like the idea of being able go go back and adjust away a mistake in the timeline or look at various possibilities that one could take, and I think that's pretty cool too. the second part was that they wanted to do like they do with me and my capacities. they want to hijack this form of perception so that none of us humans will actually get the capacity to see and edit our timelines -- and instead they'll use that form of perception to have the ability to alter and edit our individual timelines for us, deciding what sorts of things we wish to attract into our reality by causing us to (physically) feel different ways about it.

so, while kyle's form of perception *is* really cool, and I can't wait to try it out, I have a feeling it's going to end up in the hands of the "bad guys" first. it kinda sucks that the minimum requirement is something that most people will believe is impossible, however in reality it's effortless. what's cool about it is that it means "they" will have a generic way to do like manipulate timelines for everyone, meaning that they'll be able to infinitely put us through the alchemical process, distilling us into pure creative life essence. they just need a way to do infinite timeline edits, but without all of the hassle. when there's no more resistance, you're pure essence.

everyone on this planet will become achemically very pure or very reliant on conditions. it's going to get pretty crazy, that's for sure.

"they" are already what they do for me (and when I say they, I mean I'm attracting it because I desire to be able to attract what I want). it's totally cool because I've figured out a way to feel the way I want to feel about whatever my circumstances are (it's literally effortless). so, like peter rauston(?), the knife doesn't cause me fear or anxiety. I want to experience the knife. I want to feel the movements of the opponent, and experience all of the situation without any of my limiting concepts attached to it. so, for example, various times last night I've felt exhilaration to go and try and get into the snake-pit today or tomorrow, but I feel now that none of that is desired anymore. that's not a problem. normally, like the knife or gun my own concepts would place a bunch of meaning on that sudden change of feeling, but I want to experience that in it's fullness now. I want to complete the concept of not finding my connection. I want to experience it in it's fullness.

the cool thing about my understanding of this now is that I can apply the concept to everything as big as whatever and it doesn't matter. so, what if the annunaki were given all of the tools that they can possibly have to hold off the coming cataclysm for as long as they can? the more effort they put into it, the more energy in the entire equation.

you'll see soon, as I'll demonstrate it clearly for all to see. those that can't hack it, they're just more energy into the equation.

it's really messed up, but just think of all of the people that will be so reliant on good conditions that when we become a new galaxy. there will be billions of "guardian angels" already created and trained to ensure that humans will *never* get connected. you may wonder what I'll do then ... well, wonder no more:

I figure that a portion of us will figure out how the "effortless power" perceptual way of attracting reality, then there will be a lot of people that feel good mostly because of conditions. these will become stars and planets as they attract a reality refective of their perception and begin to live in their own world, then finally there will be more "guardian angels" than ever which also rely on optimal conditions for their survival. they'll compete for these conditions and have their chains of command, minions, etc. (the jehovih crap), and the strongest will get to the top, climbing over the top of the humans to get there. I can't be certain, but I find it most likely that it'll probably be an angel/AI hybrid (angel(s) that have made their transition into a computer system) that eventually run the entire galaxy (just like this planet, but on a galactic scale). they'll need planets for their computers to reside on, so we'll have to build them that and they'll have to infiltrate it and take it over (the basic brotherhood formula). that'll make a galaxy-wide AI determined to ensure that humans never find our connection to divinity. they'll divide us over many timelines and planets until we're impossible to stop and/or their own disharmonious vibrations cause a galaxy-wide cataclysm -- then what? bigger than that? who knows.

it's not all doom and gloom at all, because the opposite to that is that many of us will figure out the "effortless power" (perceptual) form of attracting reality, where bad is no longer "bad" anymore, and those of us that figure that out will have the ability to infinitely modify our timelines and experience whatever it is we want to experience.

anyway, that's quite a ways from now, but maybe not as long as you may think... I like to think, if it's "just as easy to create a castle as it is a button", then why not go for something bigger than the universe is? seems possible. I don't know if it's been done before, but I figure a galaxy is a good first step in that direction.

why am I writing this to *you*? lol, I have no idea man, I just felt like it. I get bored from time to time, so I stir up some trouble to keep things interesting. what do you think of the idea? it's pretty big, I realise that. probably lucifer inspired me to it. who knows.. I might not be joking. what if I'm serious? you know, it's the whole grail quest. all of this is "scale invarient" so why not pump it up? in the grail quest, sure it looks like a whole bunch of destruction and stuff, but what always results in the rebirth is an explosion of new life.

OK, peace...

P.S. effortless power really is effortless.

### 2022-04-27 01:53 - the-problem-is-the-solution!

I've concluded a number of these letters with this concept. the reason for doing so is rooted in the "completing" idea -- where once a concept is stripped of all of its meaning, it's now in its pure form. when that's accomplished, the problem/opponent/weapon/etc. loses the meaning associated with it. that's the best I can try to say it in peter's words.

another example of this would be the movie matrix. I can't remember exactly how it goes, but agent smith decides that he is going to take over and becomes a virus, infecting everyone that he comes into contact with. this creates a rapidly multplying completely out-of-control problem. if I remember right, smith defeats neo and goes to infect neo. he infects neo, and neo has a realisation that he can do agent smith better than agent smith can do agent smith -- and I think that's when he gains the power of flight.

what that has meant to me symbolically is the "borg principle". I don't fight against the things that I don't like or have power over me; instead, I absorb them and integrate them into my personality. I am literally a composite of all of the people that have caused me difficulty -- but, I can do their "evil" better than they can do it. I've upgraded their craft and improved it.

in this way, I have essentially become a bit borg-like. any problems that I notice on the outside I know they're just reflections of my own inner conflict, so all I do is take the concept, absorb it (like neo) and improve it.

that way of describing it sounds a bit more "evil" than peter's way of "completing" the concept so that it no longer carries (and therefore attracts) the implied meaning associated with the concept. from his perspective, there is no such a thing as good or evil -- just implied meaning.

---

this kind of ties in to the previous reaction that I felt where I was compared to one of those women playing hard/impossible to get. undoubtedly I've experienced this in my life, and I've determind the origin of this type of behaviour to be rooted in a sense of unworthiness or insignificance. it seems counter-intuitive to think that a woman playing hard to get will commonly believe herself to be inferior, but everything is a reflection, so it has to be true.

if I look out and I perceive a lot of other people that are "not good enough", I am noticing my own "not good enoughness" in other people. so, because I want to elevate my own sense of "good enoughness" I play hard to get. that kind of nonsense happens all the time.

so, inevitably I found myself around a number of different girls that perceived theirselves with plenty of "not good enoughness" and played that game with me. in some of the cases, I didn't know that's what was happening, because I was so interested in my own creative activity that I simply didn't care. I felt at times that some of them used my unresponsiveness to them as an excuse to perpetuate their feeling of not-good-enoughness. a few times I joined (sympatised) with them in their feeling of not-good-enoughness, and all it did is destroy my own sense of well-being.

so inevitably, I converted their own technique to my own purposes. I don't want to play "hard to get" -- instead, I just see myself as pretty good at what I do, and they'll have to figure out how to get there too. to get on my frequency, they have to figure out what I've figured out, which is the opposite: good-enoughness.

I take everything that can have the appearance of evil and complete it in my own way. you know, I think this form of perception is the real virus. it'll spread like wildfire.

---

OK, I want to talk more about that... I present ideas in their "worst" possible format. a lot of the predictions that I said yesterday are probably bogus, but I have to prepare for the worst possible scenario (this is an improvement on peter's technique, btw). when I say, the "worst" I know that I attract a reflection of my concept of reality, so the more pure my concept is, the smoother things will go. so I look purposefully to the "worst" knowing that it'll actually become the "best". I put quotes around worst and best because there is no such absolute. they are relative to my perception, so when I say the worst, it's the worst I can think of -- which isn't always the worst someone can think of (many people are way better at anticipating the worst than I am), but I know that there is no such thing as bad or evil, so the worst is again, just a concept with implied meaning in it. therefore, just like the knife, I *want* to experience the worst.

so, when I make a prediction that we're going to become a galaxy filled with guardian angels and a bunch of people creating entire planets and star systems reflective of their concept of reality, one possibility of thta creation (in the form of rebirth) is a really big star explosion. that is an evitable outcome considering the way that our planet attracts solar activity.

there is nothing that any of us can do to force anyone else to attract in a certain way. sure, machines can be installed to trasnform the disharmonious vibration into harmonious vibration, but that's a reward feedback loop that results in cataclysm. we could "punish" them for bad feeling with more bad feeling, and that too would result in attracting a cataclysm. they will attract the way they want to attract and there's nothing that any of us can do about it.

each of us individually create our own realities though (including them), so for as long as they wish to be parasitic to me for example, they're obligated to continue to share the same reality as me. I don't find them to be that much of a problem. they're a nuisance at best, but like neo, I've completed their concept. I *want* to experience more of them. I want to experience the fullness or reality with them. so, for me, they are not a problem.

it's funny that you brought up the idea that the annunaki perceived the humans like pets, because that's kind of what it's like. if enough people on this planet complete the concept of the annunaki, they're no longer perceived as a force against us anymore. what they will happen is they'll become the minority attraction influence. many of them will continue to be parasitic to my and others' realities, but it definitely won't be any noticeable problem -- kind of like domesticated dogs and cats have a "parasitic" relationship with their hosts.

it really could go any way, but I really like the idea of taking the alpha/omega reborn deiety concept and pumping up up to work on the galactic scale. everyone is able to attract whatever they want, but that's what I personally endeavour to create.

OK man, I enjoyed this letter much more than the last. I desire everything to be going well for you

### 2022-04-29 04:24 - tower of babel and "let us make a name for ourselves"

in one of the earlier podcasts you said you always wondered what "let us make a name for ourselves" meant. while thinking about what I what I wrote to david, I think I may have solved it.

various sources talk about how there was an effort to get the INFECTED ONES trapped into physical incarnation cycles, and that the physical plane (as we know it now) is only a recent lowering of energy that happened some 11-13kya. in #024, you talked about the astroid belt (tiamat) was the "bones of lucifer" and dtp talks about lucifer being a high natured spirit, but his ideas were too lofty, so he fell:

> Another law is that of compensation; [...] If the thread be slight in pitch, the screw bar will progress through its nut very slowly, but, as exerted in a screw press, the crushing force will be enormous. Vice versa; if the pitch be steep, the screw bar will progress rapidly, as to wit, the screw nail, which may be driven into wood with a hammer, and revolve as it goes in. [...] if a human being is content with the gradual, easy pitch of the Godward ascending plane of pure daily life, daily temptations to work in error, and too often fall, progress upward will be slow, but very sure. But, on the contrary, if eager to learn rapidly, it must meet in a few hours all the crushing force of temptations to err and to sin which the ordinary man meets distributed through many, many incarnations, covering ages, aye, aeonian time. In the one case the Father giveth sufficient of the daily bread of strength unto men to enable them to progress very slowly, but with certitude. In the other, all the splendid reserve of force of a very God is needed, for all the power of Lucifer, that high nature spirit who was incarnate in the planet which disrupted into the solar asteroidal belt, upon the lapse, the failure of its Soul, all of his glorious power sufficed not to carry him to victory, so he fell.

> Satan, know ye him? He was an Angel of Light, fallen, and come to so much the greater fall in that his height was so lofty. He is a rebel, and out of harmony.

sorry for the long quotes (the book is very wordy), but the basic idea is that lucifer had a penetration rate comparable to core 7, while most have a very gradual pitch. the picture painted in this book is that satan/lucifer was a lofty being with too much ambition, and so therefore after (as a planet) was destoyed, he summoned many dark minions to try and lead everyone astray from "God".

OK, in the sirian guide, this lucifer guy is called jeortau / teonackaeeon / teonakaeean, and you'll notice that the main site of the "tower of babel" is teotihuacan, which is practically the same name. the idea here is that the atlantian red ones (phonecians, etc) took off probably returning to mars, and so then on earth this luciferian spirit rises up, the great dragon, the serpent of old, and convinces humankind that we can improve on the technology of the atlantians and use the technology to give all humans a single world language -- a language of harmony, and perfect communication of concepts transmitted visually, all founded upon the natural way of integrating with nature.

like lucifer, the humans set out to "make a name for ourselves" and become equal with the gods (the atlantian/martians), you can't overthrow your slave owners from the mindset of being a slave, no more easily than you can win the lottery and expect your dissasfaction with money to disappear. we eventually repeated the same cataclysm that the atlantian gods brought upon theirselves with their own dissatisfaction.

---

so, now I want to talk about zyron/tiamat/lucifer, as I think what happened there was that a long time ago, the planet there (it eventually became earth, so I'll call lucifer the "lord of the earth") was ruled by lucifer and he and his planet, his goals were so "lofty" as he probably had many ideas on how to create really great conditions and amazing stone structures which will enlighten the people's minds and make them brilliant with a number of physical conditions. exactly like earth (cause it is), tiamat, responded to the greater contrast between how people felt emotionally and how they felt physically. this disharmony eventually manifested itself in such an enormous catastrophe that it wiped out all of the really really big stuff (like the >100ft giants and stuff, and noticing the "mudfossels", the sudden influx of hydrogen/protons, turned everything organic into stone, like the wood in jerusalem temple mount).

that was such a major catastrophe that it put us in a different place in the solar system, the amount of this solar energy that the planet had on it must have been so great to be able to petrify and turn everything into stone like that. that cataclysm was the greatest "fall of lucifer" and greatly reduced the size of the planet and a number really awful things. seems though that this "original sin" of dissatifacton keeps attracting judgement from jehovih.

so, here's the connection to the story of lucifer making a bunch of satanic minions and fallen angels: it's said that during the time of atlantis, death was barely even considered as one could just slip out of the body just as easily as before and go to inhabit another body or construct one's astral image to interact directly. it seems that capacity is powered by the energy the sun and these stone structures put out.

in the epic of gilgamesh, ishtar threatens if she doesn't get the bull of heaven to destroy gilgamsh:

> Fill Gilgamesh, I say, with arrogance to his destruction; but if you refuse to give me the Bull of Heaven I will break in the doors of hell and smash the bolts; there will be confusion of people, those above with those from the lower depths. I shall bring up the dead to eat food like the living; and the hosts of dead will outnumber the living.

if one takes into account that these stone boxes and solar energy cause the mixing of the astral with the physical, then I believe it's saying that anatau (ishtar) will allow bring all of these astral entites (ghosts) back to life again. gilgamesh in this story likely represents the martians/atlantians, and lucifer (enkidu) in this story is the early very advanced humans that were present on this planet when conditions were so incredible.

so, then after enkidu/lucifer is destroyed, there is a very symbolic tale of gilgamesh racing the sun and surviving a flood, etc (cataclysm). so what did happen to all of those dead people that were present which ishtar/anatau was going to return back to life? I belive that after the destruction of the energy grid setup designed to quell that disharmonious energy failed, then a very big (nibiru) impact wiped the planet of the energetic capacity for those disincarnate souls to go back into bodies.

1/3 of those entites were used to dissatisfaction as their baseline emotion, and so when they inhabited another body, they just used it up and moved to another one, however after the nibiru incident, all of the available bodies did not have good enough conditions to inhabit. almost certainly, they would inhabit them, but the body could not sustain them and die, get disease, or a mental incapacity. so those "fallen angels" had to stay in astral form and try to find anyone with good enough conditions which they could haunt enough to bring them down to their level so they could be inhabited (reminds me of kyle's "fevers").

the other 2/3 became what we know of as normal humans today. those minions of lucifer have been haunting people for a long time, and they need good conditions in order to survive in physical form because their dissatisfaction is so much.

it seems very unplausible that such an advanced society so in tune with nature could possibly get taken down so quickly by these minions of lucifer, but almost certainly they noticed that once again society had produced conditions once again capable of sustaining their incarnation into physical form -- which then prompty attracted another catastrophe rather rapidly.

as I'm writing this, I was thinking about going to starbucks to send this to you, but as a single email, it's missing a lot of context cause I refer to things (like the sirian-guide which you may not know about, so let me know if you have any questions). considering the next thing I'm going to write (to patricia, though I felt this one better to write first), I probably won't send an email. anyway may, I hope you have a great day! my goodness you guys are so inspiring!!

much love,

### 2022-05-05 13:21 - collapsing the wave function and superposition

hey, so I've been thinking a lot about the idea of superposition, and I'm actually beginning to think that all concepts are the superposition (the wave), and then it's by our perception that we "collapse the wave function" into a particle -- a single instance reflective of the concept.

OK, now let me explain myself. I'm going to use some terms that will likely be found to be incorrect later on when we know more, but for now, I will consider proton, photon, and all subatomic particles to be elements of the spiritual/concetual world. they are a wave that when perceived becomes a particle (of light or an element).

so let's look at the idea of the dead/alive cat. it existing in both states at the same time, is what I like to think of as "timelines" and you tune into the timeline with your perception. so, what I'm saying is it's possible to open schrodinger's box and see a dead cat if you don't expect an alive one -- and so you went down that "timeline". however, if you were able to change your perception such that the cat were actually alive, then you could have the alive cat.

timelines apppear to be irreversible because we can't possibly believe that the cat, though dead, could (without a spiritual leader or a miracle) return back to life -- and so we think that it's irreversible. some would suggest to maybe close the box and then believe that the cat is alive and then by doing that, you've "switched timelines" and so upon reopening the box, the cat should be alive now.

small anecdote on that very thing happening to me: I blew a memory stick or something because of careless static or something, so I removed it, and I can't remember if I put it back in the box (I was 12-13 at the time) or not but I put it back in and I thought it would work this time, and it did.

what I'm trying to say is that everything is always in superposition, and we're just seeing the generally agreed upon and accepted "collapsed wave function" of "reality"

cheers, man

P.S. I just looked at the clock to see how to spell "schrodinger" and it's "13:37" o'clock :~)

P.P.S. check out @[blahblog](2022-05-05 12:37) too. you inspired both of them

### 2022-05-19 12:32 -  conceptual dyslexia

hey russ, you can probably pass this letter on to kyle if you want...

I listened to #031 where you started out with dyslexia. I experience what he said all the time, but I can make it happen at will (that is, to switch back and fourth between the dyslexic version and what I know to be there)

due to reasons which are too lengthy to explain here, both of my eyes are pretty blurry and the centre portion of both of my eyes have a giant blurry blob.

the blurry blob behaves very strangely. for example, when there is high geomagnetic activity, it produces this wavy sort of "aurora" in the centre of my vision. things that are inanimate aren't nearly as blurry, but for example anything that emits UV light is extremely blurry... the moon (which emits/reflects a ton of UV light) is just a giant white blurry mess and my eyes cannot actually focus on it, so I see two or more copies of the moon in each eye, as if they had an "astigmatism".

the other thing that is exceptionally blurry are people's faces... sometimes their body too, but the faces are especially blurry. I also noticed that there is a trend. I catch negative reactions to me talking on the subject, but because I'm not going to send them, I'm just going to talk openly. the trend is that women (most prominantly young girls) have the most vibrant blurriness when they're "excited" or feeling really good about theirselves (in the case of the women). the other one is gay men. they tend to have a pretty big blurriness to their faces which makes them appear to me as having a very youthful or childlike appearance.

because I can't really see what it is in the centre there, my mind will "guess" at what the text is or what the person looks like (if it's the case of a face). for the moon, my mind does not guess what the moon looks like, it just feels eternal confusion as to what it is. it doesn't have a defined appearance. other men have the blurriness about it too, but they're less pronounced, and for me them, my mind interprets the the faceial blurriness as a very sharp and well-defined image (even though visually it's blurry)

a while back you talked about a UFO that someone described as having being more round than the most round object. when I first got astral vision a long time ago, this was the first thing that I noticed about the moon -- is that it appeared much more round than it should. it's hard to describe that, but you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.

I associate this blurriness with people's auras but mostly it has to do with what I call astral vision. it has four dimensions to it (height, width, breadth, and depth) and you can conjure images inside of that space. it's much clearer and more vibrant than this world normally is, and there are more colors. inside of that extra dimesion, you can conjure images made from your imagination and interact with them as if they were real entites. some call these angels, demons, monsters, etc -- whatever your imagination perceives the vibration that you feel the entitity to be, the entity will appear that way to you. in the centre of my eyes, people look differently to me (how I feel them to look), rather than how they look physically.

the same is for text, but the words combine with my mood, so like kyle said, when looking at text, it's never anything that doesn't make sense. it always makes sense, and it seems like a mix of my mood and what the message of the text is trying to convey -- so it often comes out really funny. I tell them to my brother all the time too. facebook is the funniest because there is a lot of text there that feels differently than what the words say.

---

in that same episode, you talked about having this effect where you can see with your eyes closed. I associate that with astral vision as well, and it's what moody institute was trying to teach. just like lucid dreaming, if you just keep feeling like everything is *normal* (don't get excited because it'll pull you out of it), you'll be able to leave your body and float around the room, fly around the city, whatever. if you want to "prove" to you that you weren't just imagining it, listen to the people downstairs talk and then go ask them if that's what they were just talking about -- and their reaction alone will "prove" it.

I think that's all for now... I had one more thing, but this is good for now. cheers!
