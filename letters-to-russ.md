### 2022-03-26 08:49 - thoughts on missing 411

I just binge-listened to all of the 411 sodes in a single night and I would like to relate that I experience a number of these sorts of effects on a semi-regular basis.

I may or may not send out this "email" -- TBD at a later time...

anyway, I've had an extensive relationship with brambles and blackberries for a time when I lived in spain. I built a fort in the middle of a ravine(?) (arroyo) and spent a lot of hanging out there. the bushes have an incredible quality of intelligence to them which I do not experience other plants to have. the branches have a pentagonal shape to them and that's what gives them their incredible flexibility and strength. they build massive structures by building upon theirselves and then drying out the bottom part. it is possible to clear out the bottom layers and have essentially a bramble structure with columns and a roof just by clearing the dried part.

I always had scratches all over my body, so I wouldn't have noticed scratches to be out of place. later however, when I moved back to colorado, I noticed that many mornings I woke up with scratches all over. these scratches were always to disguise a dull aching below the skin where "they" would put microscopic (nano) "inserts" under my skin.

I also experienced a lot of the "missing time" experiences when I would go out to a field and "watch stars" -- this is a technique I rediscovered from where we get the word "staring" which is to fixate a star into the centre of the vision and then relax and allow an expansion of the visual space. it greatly increases the production of DMT and with extended lengths of holding the star in the centre while in a relaxed state, you will experience hyperbolic geometry and fractal patterns similar to an ayahuasca, DMT, or "shrooms" experience.

in these states, I go into a state of mind very remeniscent of what most of the young girls experienced in the 411 cases. I interact with beings and "concepts" that are very difficult to explain with physical attributes. I don't actually "see" them. this state of mind is entirely perceived on the conceptual plane (I can describe all of these things with physical attributes and colours, but I don't actually "see" any visual information).

this lack of visual capacity has existed since my "imagination" was completely shut down when I had a brain haemorrhage in my pre-motor cortex near the top of the right hemisphere -- where the brain creates the desire to move. I should be a vegetable, but instead I make reality really quickly.

these "star-watching" experiences are interesting because I used to lose consciousness all the time. from time to time though, I wouldn't lose consciousness, and I was stuck in a black nothing where I couldn't move my body (very similar to sleep paralysis), and I could lay and relax and what felt like a turbulant motion was draining my entire body of the energy that I had been receiving from the star. I could fight it to return to consciousness, and when I did, I came back and my entire body was numb and without feeling with this prickley sensation all over it (reminds me of marty's ufo encounters). I was also unreasonably cold -- a deep biting cold down in the muscles down to the bones (opposite from cold weather going from skin down to muscle, and hypothermia and stiffness is when it starts to reach the bones).

from time to time, I would "push through" on the experience and I would begin to feel a warm sensation all over my body and the pricklyness would increase just like happens when you "die" or enter into a NDE (it's related to an increase in DMT production). when that happened, suddenly, as if by magic, my paralysis and the blackness would lift and I would find myself back in the body. usually though, I did not regain or retain consciousness through the experience and it was just "missing time". without checking my phone a lot (total buzzkill for the star experience), I couldn't reliably tell you how much time was lost -- but judging by how far the stars moved in the sky, it could be anything from minutes to entire hours.

whether I lost consciousness or not, often times when trying to stand up rapidly after the stars, I would be very out of balance, unable to walk in a straight line. a few seconds with bent legs and I could regain my ability to stand and then everything back to normal again in a few minutes. now, I don't lose consciousness anymore. instead, what happens, is the "kundalini" begins to rise at the base of the spine... I stop it though (see mantak chia for explanation of the cosmic orgasm), and it keeps starting lower and lower. first legs, then shins, then heels, now the arches of my feet. it's rising so rapidly now that I don't even need to watch stars. I just directly feel the "kundalini" rise when there is a c-flare. if there's an m-flare, I'm having trouble to stay in my body, and I haven't experienced an x-flare yet. the last few days have been very difficult to sleep and a reduced apetite.

I forgot to mention... one time (can't remember if I lost consciousness), I manifested ants in the middle of winter after watching stars. another time live scorpions (in cold weather). I've also seen it happen if I sit in the sun especially a vibrant sun in the winter (snow ants).

I've lost consciousness a lot, and again, this happened to me a lot when I was in spain. I would drink a little bit, like have maybe one cup or a beer and it would activate that pre-motor cortex and I would have happen where "reality would manifest very rapidly" -- like I could *feel* (remember, I don't have visual), the room getting calmer, and it would. if I felt myself levitating -- I lost consciousnss. I thought that was the alcohol at first, but now that I'm doing it consciously, I'm certain that it's related to the same reason for the "missing time" while star-watching.

in that state of mind, everything that I felt became a reality, very quickly. oh, did I mention that water is a very efficient carrier of this solar energy (chi or vril), and a "babbling brook" can easily induce this state of mind. for simplicity I'll call it the conceptual state of perception.

in this state of mind, everything that you feel reflects in reality very rapidly. in past times, I'd call this the "garden of eden" -- as I think that's literally the state of mind that adamu was in during that time -- it's related to the brain stem and the pre-motor cortex. every thing just feels natural there.

have you ever noticed that crazy crazy stuff could be happening in a dream and it all feels "normal"? I was not alarmed by the scorpion or the ants. they felt natural to be there -- then, my logical brain kicked in and I felt very strange about their presence, but in the creation process, I felt completely at ease and normal, as if they were supposed to be there.

---

OK, now that I've laid the foundation of where I'm coming from, I'd like to see if I can give my explanation to these occurances.

it's hard to separate the two because I have many experiences where that switch flips, and all of a sudden I'm creating reality fast -- and levitation and bilocation is a thing.. I don't know if those girls were bilocating or levitating, as that seems a very plausible thing to me in my realm of experience. the unexplainable items are also fine to me, as in that state of mind, if you feel you want or need something and have no resistance to it (I'm lost or I have no one to give it to me), then you just create those things and situations. it was often times difficult to separate my imagination and "reality" -- much like a very young child has a very difficult time making concrete sense of what is "real" just yet.

for me all of these experiences can easily be explained with that conceptual (garden of eden) state of mind.

---

so while I can explain the 411 as a manifestation of the conceptual plane of perception, there are numerous details in these stories that suggest something else may be happening.

often times when I enter into these states, the temperature drops very rapidly (see below section) -- and, like I said, I have to be very careful to *not* allow the kundalini to rise or to not leave my body, start levitating, because if I don't I lose consciousness. 

what I believe is happening is these people are just very sensetive people, like I am, and what happens is some event allows them to enter into this state. it often times happens to me when I'm left alone, relaxed, and around water. mountains, granite, gold, and shining crystals also have this effect on me. I figure these are all the trigger to them then entering into this state.

I've developed my capacity quite well, so I navigate the conceptual plane very well, but your average person will not. like me at the beginning, I was swayed by any feeling that was put into my perception. I could easily be steered into a river, away to a remote location where I would lose time and then be "adjusted" back into physical plane.

whoever "they" are, they do not want my to experience any other reality than the physical (I don't even have an imagination). for now, I'll just call them the custodians because they insist that I stay focused on the mundane physical experience.

there is a very major clue as to who "they" are because of the overwhelming number of blonde children that are abducted. the other major clue is that the FBI gets involved so frequently.

what I believe has happened, is "they" have made an agreement with the USA allowing for testing and abduction on the citizens in exchange probably for technology. the FBI is there to ensure that no evidence is ever found which can trace back to "them".

I believe clothing is always lost because a person like me (or any clairvoyant or remote viewer) can use the clothing to "tune into" the situation. it's interesting the one situation of the woman in the tree that the clairvoyant explained where she would be.

I believe that their goal is to do non-harmful tests and release the person back to reality. if that weren't the case, I wouldn't be able to write this. I may get into trouble with the US govt, but not them (they appear to have very powerful influence over the US govt).

I noticed in the cases where the person has extensive search parties for them and the searches don't give up, the person is found dead. however, if the searches give up, then I think the victim is released back into the wilderness, and then natural desire will cause someoene to just "happen" or "by chance" go to look where the victim is. this is basic "law of attraction" stuff. if you keep looking at the dire situation, it gets worse, but if you let go and allow the solution, it shows up.

also in marty's UFO reports, you notice a similar thing. they're not aggressing. they may pull some hotshot stunts (like the game of chicken), but most all actions have been reactions.

the cases down in south america (brazil?) where people were killed or left in an incapacitated state around energetic locations, looks not to be "them" but actually the US govt. I believe "they" gave the US govt the technology to manipulate people's minds (the network) and also UFO craft technology.

from my own experience, "they" are behaving according to the "law of attraction" and so, as such, sure I lose consciousness, but they don't bother me, and I'm well advanced in my capacities. I just have to stay away from the astral plane (4d) and the conceptual plane (5d) and everything is fine...

---

I can hear your reactions to that last bit already... lol, I believe the reason for it is larger than you may think. in the astral plane, your imagination with a little bit of focus will manifest itself in 3d space. you (and others on the astral) can see it and interact with these images. they can be anything from "astral records" (secrets, etc) to demons or angels, or anything you can "see" in your imagination.

in numerous "end times" prophecies, it talks about all of these demons that interact with and terrorise humankind. well, they not real demons, until "you" focus them into this reality enough to interact with you.

when I was younger, I would walk outside and my fears would mainifest theirselves as shadow creatures and jump out at me (especially in the dark or low sleep), so it was quite a relief to me to not see my imagination anymore after the haemorrhage. now, I'm quite good at feeling the way I want to feel, so I find it very unilikely that anything that I would feel would have any lasting negative effect on my environment. in fact, I can pretty much guarantee that only good-feeling things would make their way into manifestation.

at this point, because I've quit star-watching, the sun completely controls when the "kundalini" will rise. I can basically feel any way I want to now, so as my focus (on wanted) continues to improve, this transition will be seamless for me. there will no longer be any way for me to lose consciousness.

that is the state of "effortless power" because anything I focus on (feel and tune to) will manifest instantly. we all have the capability to do it, and the goal is to manifest what's wanted rather than demons and catastrophes for others to experience.

in the larger scheme of things, I believe this manifestation of "them" and their prevention of humankind's (or, at least my) access to the conceptual (5d) form of perception is a reflection of the age old brotherhood initiations: first, you gatta want it, and then you gatta "earn" it.

for me, it's not a mantra, a breathing technique, drugs, sex, or focus on a star -- though those do work. instead, this is about the ability to focus reliably on what's wanted. instant manifestation is a pretty big deal and personally I don't want dead fish and scorpions raining from the sky. though, I don't know what other people are looking for.

book, written.

SNAKES!!

the other thing that I noticed is that storms occur around me frequently. so does exceptionally sunny or clear weather. it's almost always an interaction between the way I feel and those around me feel.

if I cause someone to have a strong negative emotional reaction, a storm rapidly forms, and on occasion it'll begin to snow or rain with a cloudless sky.

conversly, if I feel exceptionally good, it could be raining all around and where I'm at, it'll be sunny and often very windy. you can verify this by looking at the historical radar images for pueblo, colorado (where I am now). the reason why the wind blows is because that good feeling (chi) will warm up the atmosphere (just like the warmth after a solar flare), and the machines that they use to neutralise that energy cause pockets of cold to rapidly form, causing strong wind (look up the correlation of snow in pueblo in relation to solar flares).

==================================

### 2022-03-28 22:05 - thoughts on sign and the seal

hey russ, I had some thoughts on the sign and the seal. there were a few parts that caught my attention.

#### the shamir duck

the duck is black and the "beak" is red. I would guess that this almost certainly refers to a red (phonecian/cairo) paternal bloodline and a black (khemit) maternal bloodline.

symbolically, I think the original "black" culture was up in upper egypt (elephantine) are the feminine/matriarchal which were then (probably aroud the time of narma/menes) became the white bowling-pin hats, while the reds retained the cairo region.

#### friday the 13th

in this section the french rounded up all of the templars and accused them of a lot of things. I remembered in a robert sepehr video that he mentioned they were accused of homosexual activity -- and I think that's what the extended pause was about. anyway, I could feel your despicable feeling when talking about how the french essentially destroyed a beneficial economic system and gave the money back to the rich.

those institutions are run by "fallen angels" -- people that have their own communication system on the astral plane. they see in 4d, hence the reference to hight, width, breath, and depth (when you get astral vision you'll see the extra space. it's unmistakable. anyway, they can astrally project, able to leave their bodies and travel around anywhere on the planet, listen in on conversations (they knew where they were going) and what to expect when arriving. colombus was a crypto jew etc, an immigration of the "red" paternal bloodline. (see robert sepehr for more info on this).

so, it's quite likely (I believe) that they were engaged in homosexual activity, and so the condemnation was probably accurate, but it is unfortunate that it's condemable in the first place.

#### chi/orgone energy and the ark

the ark of the covenant is setup like an organic accumulator. it has layers of harmonically (or perhaps octave) resonant spaces of organic and inorganic material, housed in the "holy of holies" which will have to be spatially resonant as well.

each layer attracts this energy (of it's spatial capacity) and then repels the non spatially resonant. if electricity is the science of energy moving through time (frequencies), orgone energy is the science of energy moving through space. this energy is always moving, but the way I figure, this energy is the "return phase" -- so think of electricity as leaving it's source and having a wavelength and frequency. it goes out and dissipates because of resistance (transforms into heat because of the resistance) and it's at that time when it "dissipates" that the energy finds its path of least resistance to return back to its source (the sun).

if you're familiar with "a dweller on two planets", I'm referring to the "navaz" or "night-side" when it's returning back to its source. this energy is attractive, and it is assured to arrive back to the sun. so, the goal is to "collect" or "accumulate" this orgone energy.

orgone can be created with thoughts and emotions. thoughts create emotions. notice that everything that you think, you will get a very small response to it that is interpretted as "no that's not right" or "that sounds good" -- "intuition" they call it, but really it's just resonance between two ideas.

accumulation and transmission of this solar energy will have dramatic effects on your reality. things that you believe and things that you feel will become manifest rather rapidly. the reason why they had to protect it from the layity is because most people feel and think a lot of things that slowly kill them (we call this living). this energy is the energy of the "great presever" or the vishnu aspect of the godhead (hence why he's called the "sun of god").

#### the "secret" to the shamir

the movement of chi or orgone can be done with various techniques, including that of breathing, but the most efficient/potent is sexually. both males and females have the "equipment" for the tranmission and reception of this energy. analgous to the "tesla coil" is the penis/clitoris, and analogous to the "magnifying transmitter" is the prostate/uterus.

think of these things (whether breathing or interacting with someone else) as a transformer of that energy. when I say "inhale" you can imagine any sort of repeption of energy, and exhale the opposite.

normal transformers have two coils: the primary and the secondary. tesla did a lot of experiements with a three coil setup though. if you only inhale and exhale, you will ultimately hyperventilate, so let's consider instead the poitive (exhale), negative (inhale) and neutral (rest) states.

when inhaling, the primary coil is the air outside you and the secondary is the air inside you. exhaling is the opposite, and your mind is the third coil. it comes into "rest" or resonance with the signal it received.

this practise is very easy when solo as you only have the focus of your own mind to worry about, however consider the case where engaged with a partner. their energy will inevitably be slightly different than your own. after inhaling, it's time to rest into it and become resonant with their energy before exhaling again.

knowing that, and a little bit of experimentation, you'll see it's pretty easy to amplify this energy. life will get a lot faster and everything manifests (your thoughts and feelings become reality much faster), so it's good to be conscious of ones velocity and direction and take the appropriate concerns to not self-destruct.

#### final note

I brougt up the "fallen angels" bit because it would seem logical to me that the perpetrators of the friday the 13th were the same power hungry guys that went there, but moved to different bodies. this puts a whole new perspective on solomon's "wise" decision to send the firstborn sons. I suspect he must have known their true nature, and he was essentially moving them and the ark down to ethiopia.

your comparison of solomon to comte st. germain was probably pretty accurate.

warm regards,
kenny

### 2022-04-26 00:31 - technology and dreams

listening to #008 now and you're talking about cell phones and dreams. this is absolutely not at all true for me.

when I was younger I would play games in my dreams and believe I also could program computers in my dreams too (something I hadn't yet learned how to do in real-life) -- so that's kind of weird. I tried many different times to learn to program computers but I couldn't figure it out until I had a brain haemorrhage when I was 16. since then, programming was really easy for me.

after that I definitely programmed in my dreams and operated computers all of the time. in fact, just the other day I was reading something on my phone that was really insightful (I have a desire to learn about something, then the answer will show up to me somehow in dream or physical reality). anyway, someone didn't want me reading that so the phone then got garbled and incomprehensible. I returned the phone back to a readable state and resumed reading, then the scene switched and it was something new. I wanted to read what was on the phone so badly, I woke myself up from the dream.

a similar occurance happened also recently where I was reading some eoteric document on the computer that I'm writing this now, and again I felt as if someone didn't want me to read it, after that I can't remember what happened, but I would like to mention that not only was the text very clear, but it was 3d and had a depth to it that I don't normally see on my screen (I'm writing this in vscode, and the letters had this parallax effect to them because they were spatial -- also the blue border around it was more vibrant and kind of alive and responsive to my thoughts a bit).

---

I would also like to mention tesla's account in his autobiography where he talks about having mastered sleeping, and he too would desire to understand a solution to a something puzzling him, so he would induce a sleep state and find the answer to his question in the dream.

I would say that if you desire to know the solution of a programming difficulty or some other technical thing, you *will* dream about it. so, I don't know if you still don't dream about tech, but you can if you want to.

anecdotally, I'd also like to relay an experience that I had one time when I ate way too many fresh mushrooms which is a very different experience than dried because, still containing a lot of the essence of the mushroom, I think more like the mushroom does rather than how I think... anyway, I tried to use my phone while on these fresh mushrooms, and the text was totally garbled to me, I couldn't read it and I couldn't figure out how to use the phone. using a computer also proved to be quite difficult as well.

with time, however, I did train myself to be able to program pretty well on mushrooms, and I would say that they are actually pretty compatible.

what it is (I believe), is that the active chemical in the dream and the shrooms (DMT) makes a compatibility layer between your brain's form of perception and what I call the conceptual world. the reason why I couldn't understand the phone was because I had assumed (was tuned to) the consciousness of the mushroom, and so from the perspective of the mushroom, the phone is entirely incomprehensible.

I don't know if my later efforts to program actually taught the mushroom how to program, but you could imagine that from the mushroom's perspective, they "see" and experince things through the nervous systems of those that have ingested their form of perception. the psilocybin molecule is essentially DMT with an extra phosphorus, and so the mushroom has come up with an ingenius way to hyrdrolyse its consciousness into DMT which has passed the blood-brain barrier, and so then it can share its consciousness with any mammal that has consumed it. mushrooms are cool :)

anyway, it appears that a person's DMT tunes them into their "conceptual world" and this seems to be interfaced with in the dream-state through the astral world (the world between the two). so, the places where you have a compatible interface for the concepts, those things will exist. what I'm saying is that if my childhood memory is correct, it's strange to think that my concept world was already capable of programming digital things and that I attracted my brain haemorrhage as a result.

---

a side anecdote further "proving" my supposition that the dream-state is the astral world and that the astral world is a mix of the conceptual and the physical (also called the imaginary world)... I've also read books in my dreams, and books are a bit of a different experience as well. the best way I can describe it is with a book: "dweller on two planets". in it, book 2 I believe, walter pierson's trip to hysperia, phyris gives him a device that allows him to see what was in the author's mind when they wrote the book, poem, etc...  for me, some books are a very vivid experience containing sensation and visuals (like that story says is happening in the astral), while other books, it feels like the entire concept is fully understood and I'm exploring the concept with the author as I read the text.

that's all for now... gonna go listen to the rest of the podcast now!

cheers

### 2022-04-26 05:24 - guardian angels and the unseen

OK, few responses to the previous letter. first, when I was talking about the visuals in vscode, I may have been mixing two things -- a dream and a real-life experience. I'm fairly certain that I did read something on this computer (it's weird how now I'm not so sure I drempt of reading things on this computer, though I seemed convinced of it at the time). however, there was another time in real-life too where something happened (solar flare? I dunno) and I started to gain 4d (astral) perception while I was reading on this computer. I did notice that in 4d when I would move my head really rapidly, before the "proper" image of what I was seeing replaced my vision, the text did have that parallax effect of the letters having an extra dimension (this happens a lot when playing games on the phone as well).

anyway, this doesn't discount from many experiences where I am reading things. I do definitely read things -- and thinking about it later, I'm not really sure how I read in dreams, because it's not usually the case that I "see" anything. it's black but the space is moving around and I seem to have some knowledge of what is happening even though I don't "see" it (as in, no image is in my eyes to look at).

this whole idea of seeing things without anything visible happens to me all the time, and it I think it could be happening here as well. for me, this is the "conceptual" (or spiritual, depending on your definition of "spiritual") world and it's largely composed of very abstract ideas. when I focus on them, they do take on form, and the form or skin that they put on is usually the most recent interaction with that concept (which best describes it). like, if it were a car, it would be the last car I saw (something tesla also mentioned in his autobiography), or the best ("perfect") representation of a concept in physical form.

these things that I interact with are real to me, and they are probably the same thing as imaginary friends are for kids. I haven't been around kids in a while but I am the oldest of 5 so I did previously have experience interacting with kids, and I believe that my acquired form of perception is very similar to children's perception. I learned it by "releasing resistance", or finding a way to perceive (conceptualise, rationalise, find logic for) something that does not feel good (the not feeling good part is the eviedence of resistance).

so, when I said in the previous letter that "someone didn't want me to ..." -- it's the same to me if that resistance is coming externally or internally. in fact it's almost always true that things that bother me about something external, are the same things that I don't like about myself -- and my attempts to fix other people are really my efforts to fix myself (through other people). so -- what I'm saying there is that it doesn't matter to me if there really is someone micromanaging my dreams -- like maybe a "guardian angel" or something, that resistance affects my dreams because I resonate with that resistance.

as an example, I said that in one of the dreams I was reading some esoteric thing in the dream and then "someone" didn't want me reading that, so they manipulated the dream -- well, from my perspective, that "someone" not wanting me to look outside of myself or to esoteric documents for the answer is *me*. it's myself, and my own resistance that is producing this effect in the dream. so, when I look at the dream from an even more conceptual point of view, the dream is telling me that everything I'm looking for *is* inside of me, but I'm still clinging on to things (outside of myself) that I think will give me the answer I'm looking for.

---

it's weird how this connects to the second part of that podcast because you were relating sleep paralysis in dreams. I have only experienced sleep paralysis a few times, and it's a struggle to get back to get my body moving again, however, I never really experienced the buzzing sound or any of that. I mentioned in a previous letter (the one about the 411) my experiences out on the field where I would be unable to move, my vision is black and when I finally come back, I have that tingling feeling all over my body and I feel very weak (as if all of the energy in my body had been drained). my sleep paralysis is much more like that -- and I've never had a presence. though, I will mention that when I was a kid, fear (so this all seems to be related to desire) would produce apparitions in 3d space that I could see. I would audibly hear my name being called, and I often times felt a dark awful presence near to me.

it was either an astral entity or it was something that my own mind had conjured -- though, I will say for certain that I only experienced it because I was tuned to it and desired their presence -- meaning, I felt fear and feared them interacting with me. nowadays, I would say that all of these manifestations were attracted by me, and if they weren't real astral entities, they were definitely my own creations.

over time, like tesla in his autobiography, I learned to control them with my desire and they produced such intense fear in me, but I figurd out that they were all in my own head -- so like, when I had to take the trash out at night, I would go out and my body would be trembling, but my brain was calm because I knew it was all in my own head.

many years later, I discovered drugs (mushrooms and MDMA) and I found out that in these states of mind *anything* can be discovered and any answer can be found. there were these little gnomes that I would interact with that I called the "reality technicians" that could answer any question that I had with this swirling ball of light and colour -- that, upon seeing it, I would experience the answer, in its entirety, in an instant. very cool. we all have this, and to access it is a simply desiring it (losing fear) without resisting it. if you haven't experienced this yet, I genuinely desire that you do. it'd be cool to hear about it sometime.

switching gears here, I noticed the theme of the guardian angels. have you ever read "oahspe"? it's a massive tome that marty brought up on UFO's (part 9) and I downloaded it to see what he's talking about. I've read a lot of it, but it mentions in the very first creation myth, jehovih is making a place for a number of angels (previously present in other civilisations, presumably present in this galaxy) to exist here on earth. they are put on earth with the first version of "man" and they comingle with man and create children that have eternal souls (the angels do not)... that earth gets destroyed and a new earth is created (kyle calls them solar regimes) and the first one is "pan" (a continent in pacific) and there is again another "tree" and a "serpent".

well, it alternates the trees (life and knowledge), but it's clear (to me at least) that this "serpent" is the kundalini and the tree is one of hemispheres of the brain -- and these mark the phases of brain development for "man"...

anyway after the serpent convinces them to one of the trees again, jehovih assigns these angels from the previous garden (in etheric) to become "guardian angels" to prevent the humans from ever getting back into this garden of "eden". interestingly, the book describes eden as being "a heavenly place", so the implication is that these guardian angels (which reside in the astral, "lower heavens" can take on physical form) and are designed to prevent us from ever getting back into this heavenly place and to realise that we are eternal beings. it's all very weird, but you can see the echos of the other myths in there.

so we get now to the part that marty brought up with the "false osiris". he convinces the humans to yet another tree and garden failure (this time though with the knowledge of good and evil), and so then now that we're able to perceive good and evil (further evidence this serpent and tree is not a physical thing), this false osiris decides that now he can split himself into the lord of the earth and god of the sky. so, now he's designing his own version of good and evil for the people, so together with anubis (the dog), they create the "brotherhood" to teach people the "good" through ritual and sacrifice. he then has thothma (who believes he is the reincarnation of the previous non-false "God" thoth) to build the pyramids.

the description they talk about floating these stones down the nile. anyway, in the next podcast (#009) you discuss your theory that the pyramid was already there and they just recased it. tura is up the nile form cairo, so that this thothma guy is likely the "khufu" guy and cause if they're floating things down the nile, this that's not going to have overcuts and stuff. I have more thoughts on that story (which I should totally talk to marty about -- I know, I can "hear" your voice in my head) -- but that's not the point. the point is, the whole reason why osiris did this was that the pyramid would make it possible for these "guardian angels" to take on corporeal form, and rejuvenation of the body.

so, could those guardian angels be the presence that you sense in the sleep paralysis? they are literally described (by oahspe) as being lower heaven entites designed to keep us from gaining access to a portion of the brain?

I personally don't experience any looming presences or anything like that. sometimes I wake up pretty pissed off, but those are always pretty traceable to resistant things, and as I release that resistance, I no longer experience those things.

I bring that up, because earlier I mentioned kids. if their process of growing up is the process of taking on a more and more material perception of reality, they are in fact taking on resistance, by believing that material things are their source for happiness -- and that is actually what is stopping the ability to perceive this conceptual world. my theory is (it's not really theory for me, as I have tons of experience and practise with it), that all of these "evil" things may be built into our DNA (dunno if that's true or not), so it's possible we have "original sin" in that way, and the original creator god -- or jehovih caused us to be a mix of these fallen angels and perfect creation -- or whatever (that's all equal to me).

what matters is how you *perceive* your reality -- which is what you tune to. in #008, you talked about how the universe is based on information, and I have a whole theory on how these vibrating concepts attract a reality which reflects the concept. 

therefore, what I'm saying is that -- on one hand there are various texts which talk of this "force" out there designed to prevent us from ever accessing that part of our mind (I call it devachan-on-earth) -- and, on the other hand, your reality is a reflection of the concepts that *you* are, meaning that none of these forces (if they even exist) can actually harm you, if you do not resonate sympathetically with them.

you are the problem and also the solution.

I wanted to talk about one more thing but I forgot it now, so I hope this letter fostered some thought. I'll see you later.
