# contemplations-with-myself

sometimes I want to philosophise and nobody is there, so I contemplate -- with myself.

### 2022-12-09 15:10 - the desire to be right

today I had a lot of thought on why I want to be right so much. the origin this thought comes from the time when I walked back home from nuvue. I understood the promethian prerspective "for the first time". when I did, I realised that we all have the promethian perspective -- which is the desire to be right, rathar than to feel good. in that moment, I realised that I didn't really want to feel good, so much as I wanted to be right. I adopted the idea that I want to be right more than I want to feel good, and went with that (probably some time around or after marcos).

in previous moments, I just sorta let happen whatever is going to happen (like tuenti or any of the other failures), but what I learned from marcos (who now I believe to be more of a 4th ray (sometimes) in his perception of me). he "got" me, and understood my naivate. however, on the other side of things, marcos really had to be *right* about things, and that really pissed me off about the whole world saying that andrea wasn't going toward me, when every single other sign says she is. I could see it clearly, but marcos (for whatever reason), did *not* want it to happen, and he also really had to be *right* about all of his untruths about what was happening.

I was mostly sad, because in his anguish to maintain his desire physically, he basically was telling me that I'm not perceptive and don't have eyes. it was stupid stuff that was clearly obvious, and this has carried forward into the future. since I moved to vera's house, I basically took up a promise to myself, which is to be *right* about all the stuff that I can clearly see untruths about. obviously that would be too much effort to do *all*, so I'm quite selective with what I want to be right about.

at the moment when I understood the promethian-perspective, I saw how I would rathar be right than to feel good (selectively), and I was very selective of what I wanted to be right about, because I do enjoy feeling good. I can't remember now, but I knew that somewhere this realisation -- wait, no I said that I would begin to "bounce between contrasts" -- because I could see that this was now going to become a big problem because I now *have* to be right about things that are secret in order to progress in life.

then, jason puts out the tesla memories video where I'm realising thmt my current situation is pretty similar to hotel-bound tesla. I'm just stuck here. I'll continue, but you know today I also noticed that another reason to be right about all of this, is actually to be *understood* by people. I get *zero* feedback to know if anyone even understands me (well, non-physical feedback anyway), so how can I even talk about things that explain this and everything else if one (or maybe 2-3) entire layers of perception (and physical frequency ranges), is simply being said to not exist.

I suppose this also has to do with the long-standing snake-bros frustration that our history is kept entirely a secret. I took a different route then them (conceptual-viewing) to figure out what "happened", but I also say with the same mouth that there are infinite pasts which lead to the present, and almost certainly we are not all on the same one. at any rate, this is the part in the relationship when you're sick of getting stone walled, and you say, either I'm right or I'm going another way. so many women know what I'm saying. the thing is, I went and figured it out, but that was because I couldn't understand the past until I understood the astral. it's impossible to explain "the earth was formless and void" until you've seen the living black, and to understand the earth took on the appearance of mars, as a conjugate of their imagination for what they desired from a saviour planet. once you can see the interplay between the layers of perception, all aspects of human history are all understandable.

I don't intend to try and force my version of history on anyone (like I said, we're all on different timelines anyway, and didn't get here the same way), but for those who want to understand the mainstream and occulted versions of human history, I offer my own for both critisisms and improvements. my vision isn't perfect and we all got here different ways anyway, so it's too difficult to say. it is a kind of "manaul for how the universe works" -- draft edition though. the only thing is I cannot convey this version of history (my story) without touching topics like the nature of and progression/expansion of perception, including the extra dimension that the "authorized phenomenon" are projected.

so, sorry about it man. you're doing it your way. you're king of the earth and I'm king of the galaxy, until my hubris brings you to need to bring me back down to inferior levels. I'll enjoy the superior view for the time I can though.

### 2022-12-13 16:19 - the good guys

this morning I woke up thinking about a lot of things. one of the thoughts that I was thinking about is similar to the previous entry where I explained that there is quite a bit of similarity to my situation now and tesla being bound to his hotel room (as a prisoner). that was jason's perspective on it. yesterday, I explained the [new symbolic repeat of the snake temping adam and eve with the "forbidden fruit"](/snakey-thoughts.md#2022-12-12-1135---snakes-and-the-forbidden-fruit) (carnal acts). this was the snake-bros/randall perspective of the same idea (looking from the opposite end). I offered a lot of solutions and said, essentially that it's not necessary to confine me and prevent me from creating the things that I want to create. in the entry, I basically outlined that my projects are more important to me than the girls. I'd rather create somethting than to be sexually involved with girls.

this morning there were a lot of reactions to what I said. I explained how girls cause me (at least experientially) to lose the "big picture" of what I want to create, and the things that are important/interesting to the girl I'm sexually active with distorts my bigger picture to include the things that are important to her -- which would be fine if she valued the same thing as me; and so, one of the reactions was to use girls as a way to remove that big picture; they don't want me to be creating anything. the other reaction was a long discussion (I'm sure) on why it's important that I don't have any earthly heirs -- meaning, no children, and that's a lot harder to control if I'm around girls.

therefore, the conclusion here is to keep me going in my present situation where I'm going to keep holding off on girls until my project is online. this is the same conclusion that I have, but for different reasons. I want to make something, not just do what everyone else is doing. we arrive to the same conclusion, but from different angles.

the next reaction was around the problem with my conclusion -- which is that if I spend the next decade or two  sitting around waiting for my opportunity to make my system, I too will end up old and stuck in a hotel (or some confined/assisted living facilty) because they don't actually want me having the capacity (money or whatever) to make my system.

I think the reason for this is because although my system would work on a pretty dfferent medium (4th ray, spectral), it still has quite a lot of similarity to the 6th ray astral lumiferous ether. I don't know enough to say specifics of what the differences are (that's part of the discovery process), and even if they could maintain control over the astral, it's too big of a problem to have something that can do such a thing, because it's easy to see that another product may want to use the same exact technology (tesla tech, essentially) to broadcast frequencies in the astral range -- and they definitely don't want that.

even if they decided that they would control all of the technology part of it and just lease out "black boxes" that can broadcast/receive on those frequencies, they still wouldn't want people to have synchronised emotions and frequencies. they need us separated and not organised (same reason for no internet). they simply cannot allow us to have a global communication network of any kind. the maximum we can get is facebook.

---

so, I had a look into why they have such a difficulty with us gaining a communication platform of any kind -- and the best I can tell, they believe they are the "good guys". the ones that are setting up this system feel like they're trying to get a superior position over some sort of opposition force -- or something. I had a look into this as well, and this feeling of their perspective doesn't even make any sense at all because I'm fairly certain that the antarctic inhabitants completely control the astral, and it seems that they've been *gifting* this technology to the US govt -- which means obviously that they have a superior system already setup on top (otherwise they wouldn't be gifting it).

my present working theory is that there is already a 2nd ray system (like the one I wanted to create) already installed, which means that I incarnated into this body not to create the 2nd or 4th ray system, but to "gift" the 4th ray system to them as well. who is "them" though? well, "them" would be the "good guys" working for the US govt, and they're trying to get their system all setup. not everyone working for the US govt is a "good guy" though -- and I think that a lot of the "bad guys" were imported directly from germany in project paperclip.

imagine for a moment that it is a 2nd ray system. 2nd ray is a mix of desire and structure. this is basically a "soul" -- and this is everybody's non-physical (above 4th ray midpoint) perspective. that means that their system can create souls (if you want to look at it). combine the ability to create non-physical souls to incarnate into astral bodies, and you can create the wenher van braun and all of the other ss agents needed to start WW1 and WW2, manipulate time and the symbolic narrative leading to this moment. the narrative is important.

this brings me to some recent things I've been considering about the narrative of don quixote. if you think about this 2nd ray system, it has one part el/la unlief/belief and one part desire, you can now see that the narrative elements that are involved here are *our* 2nd ray system. they create souls with machines that accomplish the symbolic goals set out (time adjusts in 4th and 6th as a result), but we do the same with our own beliefs and desire.

in don quixote, the book focuses around romance and the romantic knight that is righting the wrongs of the world. place me now symbolically in the spot of don quixote and replace "romance" with "saviour". the book is hard on romance saying that it's not necessary and that it even kind of makes one look a bit silly to others around. well, I say the same thing about saviours. don quixote is still quite romantic (tim explains this in the video citing one of the passages). well, again there is quite a similarity to me here as well; the entire point of @[snakey-thoughts](2022-12-12 11:35) was to explain "I have solutions" -- and that we can have it all. once the system is put into place, then girls are no longer that big of a problem -- or rathar that it'll have to become a galaxy-sized problem before it becomes a real threat -- and I'm fairly certain that we can extend my scheme to use contrast/drama as the power source for an even larger setup. I claim that my system *is* how source, our universe and all things non-physical operate, so it's not violating anything or causing problem, but actually solving them. in that sense, I am putting out ideas that would make me "saviour" -- so like don quixote, I'm actually quite the symbol of the thing that I hate (saviours).

personally, my position on saviours is that saviours are actually stopping growth, because they're making it no longer necessary to make the decision about how one wants to feel and perceive their reality by providing conditions, like contiually faster/more energy which hide all of resistance[^1] -- therefore, I don't think too highly of saviours. they don't actually fix the problem, but only allow it to go unnoticed for longer.

I would enjoy it much more if others would find a way to feel the way that they want to feel, but obviously I can't do that for others. only others can do that for theirselves, so I must step away from this one and allow everyone to create their own realities on their own. the "good guys" are out there trying to fight against an even more secret elite "military industrial complex" (which I believe, along with most of the nazi party are created entities/egregores). I have to just let them all create their own realities.

---

this leads to the next subject of my contemplation, which is -- if they're all working real hard to be their own saviours and I'm just "gifting" them some lower tech stuff so they can become their own saviours (and give others in the world an opprtunity to feel the way they want, even in controlled conditions), then it seems like I should just go the direction of the girls, right? why keep trying to make a system that is probably already made? it's probably just as good as theirs, and if they come up with any improvements, they're likely integrating those improvements to the technology back into their own system anyway (this is bacon's "new atlantis").

this is a bit of a conundrum for me, because I'm totally fine giving them *all* of the advantage (zero resistance) to create the system that they want to create. they view people like me and my ideas as a threat to their setup, so if I do continue to go with the "ne earthly heirs" setup, then I'm giving them no opposition to getting full control over everything -- as in, there won't be any children born with my perspective, inheritted genetically -- and instead, all people will come to arrive to a form of perception similar to my own (of the individual) all on their own. no saviours.

I was thinking about all the stuff I wrote above yesterday, and the reaction that I was getting last night was that they simply don't think it's possible for me to be around all of you guys and/or any girls and not get pulled in by them. I would [need a better reason to maintain abstinance](/sepehr-thoughts.md#2022-12-08-1954---abstinence-is-the-process-not-the-destination), then.

[1]: I like to think about cars that have their parking brakes on. if you have a weak car, it's quite noticeable. however, if you have a powerful motor, you could go for miles before you realise that you've got the parking brake on. it's like jon's description of microprocessors and softwar. the continually increasing power of microprocessors is completely hiding that software is gaining uncontrollably in complexity. our problems are growing but we can't see the problem because hardware is advancing so quickly.

### 2022-12-13 21:48 - whos desire is stronger?

as much as I try to mostly talk to myself here, I notice that it's still a bit of a group conversation. I don't mind that much, cause it still causes me to think about these ideas... the reaction is if I go with girls, when, and stuff like that...

I still keep my idea that I'd like to "get connected" before any girls, because then I'd be using the girls then as a condition to find my connection -- and I don't really want to do that. if I want to use conditions to get connected, I'll go outside and watch stars until my kundalini rises; it's not really that hard. the real question here is whos desire is stronger? is nosebook's desire to keep me held down stronger than other peoples' desire for me to get out from under nosebook (which, depending on how you look at it, is the precursor for cataclysm)?

### 2022-12-15 22:59 - desire to be right

I'm laying on the ground about to go to sleep and there's this thing that I really don't understand. I mentioned (somewhere -- perhaps to mom) that it's really important for me to "be right" about nosebook and my current situation. I don't have it all figured out, but the things that are obvious to me, I'm going to insist on being right about[^1] I continued to give an explanation for this saying that I'm tired of people constantly telling me I'm wrong when it's so plainly obvious to me what is happening.

today when listening to LEFTL (2022-02-27), eon is talking about a documentary called mirage something (can't remember), and he was explaining how important it is to be able to say, not just "your wrong" or whatever but to actually give evidence for it and to be able give a list and say -- here are all of the reasons why the things you're saying clearly don't add up. "*this* is what is really happening" and to have actual evidence for it. seriah is trying to tell eon that the government just lies because that's what they do -- and eon is trying to explain to seriah that it's not just that they are lying, but *why* they're lying -- as in, get to the bottom of the structure the whole charade is built up around -- because, if you can get to the core thing, then it's possible to strip away all of the superfulous untruths and distractions designed to hide that core thing and see it for what it is[^2]...

to understand eon's angle here, let's put what he's talking about in the context of my situation. the core issue (regarding the government and their secrets) that I've come across is twofold. it actually ties into what I want to talk about later, so let's start there. the first core concept I've come to discover is, that these entities persist and have long-term objectives that seemingly last longer than a single lifetime (like an empire, government, philosophy, etc) do not care so much about the legacy they leave behind. combine this with the tales of "fallen angels" and other astral entites that seemingly move their consciousess around in astral space (astral projection), and/or use is it haunt and then take over/inhabit (move their consciousness into) a new body.

the way that I figure this process of inhabiting a new body works is by using astral (I dunno the word for it -- but it's a strong "sense" or feeling where some artificial reality is presented, like a film, where for a moment, you suspend your sense of "reality" and believe this new reality -- a sort of suspension of belief), and in that moment, what is happening is the new body, being mostly unaware of what is happening, is the new body is being "tuned" to the new astral personality that will "walk in" to the body -- very much in the same way that I am able to move my consciousness around and look at or feel anything I want in time or space. as far as I can tell, the effect is the same, but I've usually only been receptive of this energy, not often projecting it out often consciously. the times that I have, I've done it usually in a sexual connotation -- and there's a sepehr video on a guy that can wave his hands around (though the movements are nothing more than something like a martial arts postures(asanas?) -- the power isn't in the posture but in the energy that flows). I can direct this energy pretty easily myself, and it's largely been the objective of nosebook to disallow me from using this energy because I would be able to levitate myself and others, throwing them around the room like those anime characters do. it's a very powerful energy, which includes everything from putting images, sounds, senses, and other forms of artificial reality into a preson body (like mushrooms), to also being able to direct this energy inward.

I know that seriah is familiar with what I'm talking about because on on of the snake-bros episodes where he was a guest, he described an early and sudden awakening of his kundalini energy to russ, and described (in less words) what I'm talking about. call it qi, chi, prana, or vrill -- doesn't matter. this is the conceptual aspect of the astral energy; the physical aspect is the pictures, sense, feeling, levity, and other physical sensations.

it appears that for a very very long time various entities have been using this energy to move thier consciousness from body to body, never actually "dying" -- and *that* is why everything is such a big secret. I know that my father knows quite well of this energy as well.

to some degree, I think it's difficult to explain this energy to other people, so instead of explaining, I've always attempted to *demonstrate* the energy in the limited capacity that I can. the other aspect of this, is that I don't think that these "fallen-angels" actually *know* or can even explain that energy very well. modern science is a reflection of this. they can *describe* the energy and it's effects (kundalini effect, I guess) -- and it has so many names, but I think it's only been in the last few decades that the US govt has begun to get a grasp on this energy from a data perspective, and they have machines (tesla stuff) that can input/output/amplify/transform the energy. very powerful stuff. this is nosebook. they use those machines to present pictures and all sorts of sensory data to the human nervous system and brain over this astral medium.

all humans have this capability, and they do not want me, you, or anyoone else to be able to do darth vader's force moves and choke out someone that angered me (cause I definitely would have done it). esoterically, the control of that energy is called "temperance" -- of which, I have very little of (I prefer tuning, and let the result be what is attracted in raw unadulterated form). this astral medium/energy the main part of the secret, I gather -- and it's this same energy that increases the rate in which you attract things. they want to control, and an attractive person like me without temperance is uncontrollable. I noticed it with seriah and all of his music subconscious/well-timed music selections (coincidences and synchros) are often pertient to me in the form of perception. with my father thoughh, he would attract from me the thing that he either wanted or didn't want in a much stronger way. I seemingly behaved as a sort of puppet to his desire/fear, makning his concept of me/reality become more and more real. with chris, we seemingly had a bit of a combined mind/thought.

OK, that's the first part to it. the second part to it, is that these fallen-angels have a pretty unsuccessful track record. many fails (inability to get/maintain the desired conditons), and for the ones that's trying to manipulate people, it would seem pretty upsetting for everyone to know that the long track record of manipulation and coersion happening behind the scenes (literally). since they're all stuck here forever, they have a hierarchy amongst theirselves and they divide the good conditions amongst theirselves, and let us have the inferior ones (that's why "middle class" is as high as anyone can go, before starting to bump into "old money" which is where most of these "fallen-angels" are sitting on top of).

as one of the "good" "fallen-angels", like I imagine perhaps seriah and randall probably are (and potentially many others as well) -- ih seems to me that they see more than the normal person and have a much longer history to work with, and so they set out to try and figure out what those things are from a more scientific/data perspective. I think this has given rise to a lot of "enlightened" inventors, scientists, and mystics. because they see more than just the physical and can interact with that chi/qi energy, they know there's a lot more to than just the physical. however, I think the reason why they keep it a secret is because of embarrassment. it'd be kinda embarrassing to admit that they've spent lifetimes trying to figure something out, but cannot actually say what it is (again, like science). I think they're trying to figure it out, so they collaborate with others that are in on their secret. their inability to actually understand/explain the mechanism, and get any actual success with this tremendous power that they have to bring "good" and "peace" to humankind, is likely embarassing. this, I feel would be about the same as asking a scientist to explain gravity or magnetism.

they know this astral medium exists where thoughts, pictures, senses can be transferred from body to body and and they reference it all the time. because I feel their astral projections, I don't "see" what they're presenting to each other, but it's pretty obvious that they interact with each other in a visual/tangible way of some sort (which I feel). jason, for example, said in response to asking if someone is "phenominally authorizing" something, said that he would need to "meet them in person" to know -- as in -- see what sort of visual/astral presence that they have, in order to be able to tell how "phenomenal" they are. other such tells are when someone says that they have "synesthesia" (like an interview with robert grant and billy), along with some others that I'm not remembering now. I'm getting to the point where I can "see" what they're talking about -- but, because no image forms in my iris, the symbols and emotions get interpretted by me through my conceptual framework, instead of the sensoral (phenominally authorized) sensory data they're presenting.

personally, I don't need to meet these guys in person to know their astral presence. I can feel it at a distance of either time or space (for me, it's tuning, not control, remi). I quite enjoy poking fun at them a bit, because they rely on the visual aspect to know something so just like everything you see on TV is real, they're pretty easily duped. however, for me it's only a feeling, so I can do whatever I want with it. even if it's frsudulent, it's still real for me, in the way I perceive it. therefore, it's no difficulty to feel the dali lama just as easily as I can feel jason, dad, enki, or seriah; so I *know* that same data from a diffrent (non-visual/conceptual) perspective. I prefer it to be non-visual, and I may even go out on a limb and say that though my feeling knowledge is a lot less "impactful" -- my opinion is that the data that I receive is considerably more relevant, and not subject to so much illusion. like watching a television commercial, it's all about presentation.

if you've ever preformed, presented or publically spoke, you know that the presentation evolves over time and gets tuned to the audience; their astral presentations feel to me like that. they've optimised their presentation of the data/symbols much like a sales team optimises their product presentation. you can imagine that, similarly to sales and marketing (and now science), a whole lot more effort is put into the presentation than the product itself. wow, perfect segue.

---

I'm a product guy, so when I'm contemplating this reaction that nosebook absolutely *cannot* allow me to be right, it's basically like the opponent sales team saying, "we cannot allow the other guys give the appearance that they are a superior product to ours" -- when in fact their product is actually inferior. I'm of the position that nosebook has been selling an inferior product to all of humankind, and it's the sales team that knows that my product (the thing I'm right about) is actually superior to their product (the thing that they say is "right").

consider the case of edison trying to prove to everyone that DC is superior to AC by shocking animals with AC to "prove" that AC is more harmful. edison knew he had an inferior product, so he resorted to gestapo-style marketing of "the right thing(tm)".

what has happened, is that the last few weeks I've been pushed to my limits on contiually being "wrong" about my inferior product -- and so now I have to "prove" that I'm right about my product. I'm not electrifying animals to prove my point, but you could imagine that my (purposefully crude) style of "proving myself rigtht" is less than elegant. I don't really mind, because I know that eventually the message will get across. another perfect segue.

---

abraham said "do you want to be right or do you want to to feel good". I took this as a challenge, because (I think purposefully), they used the word "feel" -- which, in english (and spanish, at least), the word feel/sentir can mean both physical or emotional sensation -- however, the thing is that "feel" is always a physical sensation. your emotion (the way you really feel) is not necessarily the physical sensation. it took me a while to realise what they were saying: "do you want to be right, or so you want to *physically* feel good". well, thank goodness that nosebook doesn't want me to ever physically feel good, leaving me with the only option of being right.

so, in order to be right, I don't need to sacrifice something I don't have. the way that I *really feel* (I need a word for this) is not based on an image, a sales pitch, a nice sounding presentation, or the way that my body feels (like from drugs, music, or sex), so I can literally feel physically any way that I want, and that doesn't change how I *really feel*[^3].

the way that I *really feel* is based on *perception* (how I connect the concepts in my reality) and isn't really anything imaginal or physical. so, for example, I know that everything is working out just fine and that I can't actually *make* anyone to see things the way I do -- however, for me it's fun to act like I can. I mostly get most of my inspiration for the attributes of my "act" (antics), from examples that I see in real-life -- so, like a child or newborn, I simply take the feeling that is presented out in the world and I "become" that feeling. for newborns, that often results in crying or a radiant smile. my body does not react so primitively to the difference between the way my "inner being" sees the same thing like a child does, because I'm conscious that the feeling that I'm putting on, isn't how I *really* see things; and so therefore after a moment of letting my body wind down a bit, I'm batk to seeing things how I normally do[^4]. every feeling is like a drug, but instead of taking a pill or smoking, I just need to "feel it" (physically) for a bit. I direct that chi/prana/qi energy toward my own body, just like the "fallen-angels" do to the person they're presenting to.

long intro. so here's this funny thing about all of these secrets, and what inspired me to write this: in the previous entry I made the illusion of the saviour being something akin to driving with the parking brake on, where instead of suggesting to take off the parking brake (ie solving the problem), the saviour says, "here's a more powerful motor that way you won't notice the sluggishness. now, you can drive as fast as you want with the parking brake on" well, that's also a pretty close example to temperance, as well.

imagine for a moment that I have this really cool thing, but I have to go around pretending I don't have it. let's say that thing is a really powerful motor. when I'm around others, in order to not look like I'm showing off that I have such a powerful motor, I drive with the parking brake on. now, my car drives sluggish and slow like theirs does... this false humility is quite humourous to me, honestly. have fun being right about why it's a superior product to drive with the parking brake on. I'll do whatever I want to do while you guys all exercise humility and temperance. righeousness posers...

[1]: I realise that this has the effect of letting them know that some of their antics are quite plainly noted, so they can further invest more time into hiding those "obvious" things. I'm doing it on purpose. I want them to get better at hiding it so they can deceive people even better. I also realise that for them, I'm kind of like a neutral dojo for them to improve their gimmick a bit, because I don't really mind so much all of their stuff, because I can see things from a pretty non-resistant perspective. I know they're not scared of me knowing, because they know I already know. they just don't want what I know and can see to become common knowledge, because others will perceive their fraud with quite a bit more resistance.

[2]: maybe, if eon wants to do "eon rambles" podcast I'd love to do a followup "kenny interprets" or maybe "kenny's angle" -- who knows -- cause eon brings up a lot of really good points, but they're very poorly presented -- so I'd want some time to think about what he says and to contemplate the idea a bit -- like, what I'm doing now...

[3]: physical sensation can affect the way you "really feel*, which is why the astral and things like drugs and sex appear to be powerful, but they're conditional, so unless you maintain the conditons, they're not lasting. it's been the objective of many to try and maintain the conditions, but that inevitably fails. only *you* (not your body/words/mouth/hands -- but the eternal "you") can affect how you *really feel* -- and that comes from perception. an actor can act a part, but afterward they will return back to how they *really feel*. if the movie script were to actually change how the actor *really feels*, I feel like actors would be much more selective of what parts they play.

[4]: yes, when I act, my vision changes and I literally see the whole world differently. it probably looks the same physically, but for me, everything takes on the appearance of the emotion of the physical perspective. if I'm angry, I see everyone as angry with me. if I'm frustrated, everyone is frustrating, etc. -- and also, yes, to some extent, I'm "practising" that emotion when I act -- just like an astral projection will "practise" the body to feel the new inhabiting entity. it's all the same.

### 2022-12-17 09:42 - I'm not what people expected, I feel

today when listening to LEFTL (09-18-2022), and watching youtube videos afterward (slowmo guys, mehedi, veritasium), I tuned into the mainstream vibe for a bit, which is not where I'm usually tuned into -- and, it's weird. man, I don't want anything to do with the way that this world is going.

for example, in the FFT video (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmgFG7PUHfo)), derek goes into this large thing about how FFT was discovered as a way to efficiently calculate the frequency components of seismographs to detect nuclear testing... I had already a pretty rough knowledge of FFTs prior to watching the video, having programmed one in the past, so it was a bit of a review -- but what blew my mind is the graph that he showed where they were having these negotations to "stop" nuclear tests above ground, presumably because radiation was being spread in the air, yet underground tests were considered OK... the graph shows the year of the meeting (no tests), then suddenly after the meeting, the number of tests jumps to 4-6x what it was previously. derek pokes a bit of fun at the names of their meetings, with names like "meeting to stop testing of nuclear somethings" -- and it sounds like a library index card or something -- as if they really wanted to spell it out super plainly what exactly the meeting is about in very plain language so that even a robot can understand it, yet on other things, they never use such plain and direct language. it seems plainly obvious to me that the plain and direct language is on purpose...

derek even points out that the agreement that they came to specifically bans all kinds of tests, in open spaces with a liquid or gas medium (ocean, space, air), but not underground, supposedly because they couldn't verify the difference between an earthquake and a nuclear test. I hate this sort of doublespeak used so much in meetings.

the other video (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXoZQsZP2PY)) was a guy working for NIST that reminded me a bit of randall with the cadance of his voice and passion for such a data-oriented subject, combined with the same sort of enthusiasm of archer (from snake-bros). he was really cool, and I liked him a lot, but when he's talking he keeps referring to the precision of his measurements, and it was derek that added in all of the extra stuff about how the metre is now linked to planck's constant and stuff. I can tell that he knows that nothing is absolute, and so everything is always in relativity to the reference. he kept calling it variance or variable or something (can't remember now). super knowledgeable, and he seemed to have found novel ways to make meausurements seem to be as absolute as possible. derek starts out the video with the guy revealing that the USA *is* on the metric, but we convert to "freedom units" (lol). he chooses his words very very carefully to make it sound like the the variability is in the measurement, instead of the conditions.

it's easy to see that this is "proof" that we have pretty accurate measurements, but it seemed to me like that lab was more about having stable conditions (underground and stuff) to be able to isolate and test the conditions which will throw off our "standard" and "constant" (fixed go plank's constant and speed of light) measurements. personally, I liked archer's explanation more for why we need extremely high precision measurement systems, and I agree with him that one day we'll be making silly things like for example candy wrappers or something with enormous precision, not beacase candy needs precision, but because manufacturing technology just prints things at already that precision. all aspects of life become more constant and predictable, and so therefore much easier to calculate and anticipate. again, I see this video *much* differently than it's presented.

the electroboom and slowmo guys video was incredibly fascinating (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r04e45E-wSc)). I hadn't thought much about it. I had alwasys assumed that both sides go to meet each other (because I see electric arcs as analogous to LOA), but upon watching that video, it was quite clear to me that one side definetely has more potential, and so therefore reaches out further in the realm of possiblities (the "fuzz") -- and if it's far enough, it can make the connection. that was super cool.

---

at any rate, while watching those videos and listening to LEFTL and watching those videos, just by watching them and listening to their voices, I kind of tune to the thoughts[^1] of them and I get a "sense"...

the "sense" that I had was something of a feeling of disappointment; as in, I'm not at all behaving like they they expectod me to behave. something to the effect of maybe something I experienced at a younger age of renting a video and the cover of the VHS has a look to it which is pretty appealing. I say, "looks pretty good" (I'm talking pre-internet here) and then when I get home and start watching the video, it's not at all what was expected from the cover/sleeve. I think that people expected a lot more "good feeling" from me, instead of constantly a challenge to their concept of reality.

I carry on and on endlessly about how one conceptualises reality is how they attract their reality, and so I've taken great care to try and figure out "what are the things I *actually* want to be right about", and then let those serve as the foundation (cornerstones) upon which I build my reality. I believe it's very important to have a pretty high precision and accurate model of reality. the brain, like all of our measurements, is the same -- models from top to bottom (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrkiJZKJfpY)). what you see with your eyes is a *model* that your brain has for reality given the signal inputs. this is, largely your "perception", but instead of measurement points, the thing that separates one concept from another is *your definition and measurement* of that concept. the sensor is only as accurate as the model used to build it and and its operator.

---

so here's the deal: let me fight my windmill dragons. I know that I'm going on and on about this "fallen-angels" stuff, partially because I think there's something to learn and discover there, but as I mentioned in my original rendering of the "fallen-angels" concept, it's the model that I want to use for the next race of human species that I will create and then subsequently transfer my consciousness into. my understanding on the fallen-angels concept has expanded tremendously since its first rendering (so I should probably write another angle to it), especially since I've learned about triads. first there's me (the ground), then there's the "good guy" (the female) and then there's my demiurge (the emitter), which are used to create the necessary conditions to produce a race of beings that does not contain the unwanted demiurge parts (think alalu, enlil, zeus, thoth), but does through the process of interaction, take those "unwanted" parts and synthesises something new and improved out if it the demiurge and the female. yeah...

hmmm, yeah I should probably write it. I'll have to also render all of my latest insights into the triads -- but the thing is, I keep getting this memristor-like hidden fourth aspect pop up over and over in my life, so I have a feeling it'll probably be a 4 insead of three. in that vein, there was also a weird comment yesterday on a bardcode video on 5 and 6 where the commenter said that 6 is *chiral* (meaning having necessary to turn the same direction), and 5 is not chiral. I always think of penrose tiles (and my change to their shape I put on geogebra) as my inspiration for 5. 5 feels infinite to me, whereas 6 feels perfect and measured -- though I never thouht about it in terms of rotation or chirality. anyway...

so yeah, I still have a ways to go. let me fight my windmill dragons. I have my own process for discovery and it works well... I'm getting there. I can definitely feeling my approach toward a new revolutionary discovery in perception. for me, I have to become the concept, so that I can receive it, so I have to *become* the the thing I want to learn (evolution-of-desire, progression-of-perception). it is a bit unfortunate that I learn through conflict and friction. you guys are my dojo. sorry for being the way I am. that's why I think out loud so much. it helps you all to see see that I'm still going toward more and more expansion of my capacity to perceive, even though it's through conflict. I learn a lot from you all.

probably what it is, is that peole wanted entertainment, not to have to actually think. thinking is hard, I know -- which is why I feel and then know instead. wayyyyyy easier. the process, though extremely effective does have a bit of trial and error (ie conflict) to it, though.

[1]: the general conceptual "field" they emit -- which is quite a lot. obviously I'm only capable of understanding the things that I'm vibrationally similar to, which is why I mostly get concepts in relation to the subject of the video and similar to my own vibration (ie. concepts familiar or understandable to me)

### 2023-01-23 18:36 - what do I/we *do*...

for a few days, I didn't play coi. then, I think the last two days I played (so it's not like I'm really going hard on it), and one of the reactions that I was getting was how serious I take the game. I mean, I take all optimisation problems seriously, but I think that's not the real issue here.

when I was younger, one of the things that I really struggled with understanding is the case of solomon. it says he had 1000 wives and concubines. most of the other guys in the bible had 2-3 wives, but not hundreds. I pondered the logistics of it for quite a while, and found that he probably didn't really have a personal relationship with any of them, so he was likely a collector, because 1000 would take over 3 years to get through all of them before returning back to the first (assuming round-robin priority system). prioritising one over another, I noted with my interaction with the women of the 90's could have dire consequences. I just didn't think it could possibly be anything that would work out well. he must have had a super power that managed to keep them all from causing trouble.

I also had sisters and they had friends, so I knew that when there are a lot of girls in one place and they have nothing to do, there's a general feeling of "I want to do something but I/we don't know what I/we want to do". it seemed to me that it would be very very difficult to keep 10+ girls occupied, 1000 would be basically impossible, so I ended up highly doubting the reported number in the bible there.

I mainly figured it had to be figurative/symbolic, or some kind of patriarchical measuring contest. nowadays, my opinion has shifted. I find it quite possible that there were a lot of women (not sure if 1000 is accurate, but let's say it was), and in reality they're being used to distract solomon while his viziers run things.

---

so, here I am playing coi and the reactions are wondering if I'll be like the typical man who is so invested in his work that he ignores the women around him, leading to the bored women/girls situation... I mean, I don't really know...

I will say this: ever since I was young, my dad would always tell me I didn't want to work construction all my life. he then took some MCSE classes to try and get away from construction, and so I thought -- OH OK, I'll do the same thing that I wanted to do physically, but instead with the software industry. I figured I could climb up the ranks really quickly and become a captain of software development. I had some ideas on some games I wanted to make, and when myspace came out, I felt like my "calling" was to instead focus on social platforms, because I felt like getting like-minded people together was something that I wanted to do.

up until then, I wasn't very successful with girls. they seemed to like me and stuff, but the minute I would open my mouth and start talking about things, I'd lose them. I never did figure out "what women want", because I couldn't figure out anything at all that was interesting to them. in fact, the *only* girl I can think of which I can positively identify something that's interesting to her is nikki and her obsession with megalithic architecture -- and, she actually thinks critically about it, too. I figured that a social platform was a way for me to meet girls that liked things that I do. I had a personal and a technical interest in making a social network.

when I got to spain, I worked really hard to make it happen, and this was apparently looked down upon. zaryn and friends were out drinking, partying, and having sex with anyone and everyone meanwhile I stayed back at the office doing what I found important to me. when they left and went off to do their thing, those were some of my most productive times.

I gget the feeling that zaryn and felix felt bad for me or something and wanted me to join them in their debauchery, so they had me go with the prostitute. the prostitute asked me if I really wanted to do it cause I think she could tell that my frineds were making me go, and I agreed thinking OK, well maybe this is just another step in getting to the top or something. nothing felt to me like I shouldn't go, so I agreed. I don't really regret it at all because it allowed me to see a whole different side of things I would have never been exposed to.

anyway, I didn't find it all that impressive at all, and it was definitely not something super amazing like they were making it sound. I didn't return back to it for quite some time, and in the interim, I was thinking, "OK, well it was probably just cause she was a prostitute and if I find a real girl, *then* it'll be awesome" -- so the desire in me to find a girlfriend grew, but I was heavily conflicted because I really wanted to make it easier to find people that are *ideologically* similar to me (essembly idea), because I'm noticing that I simply have nothing that I can relate with any girl on in spain. they're all used to a bunch of guys making a big show for them, and all I have is incomprehensible conversation.

in fact, the whole subject of conversation was such a difficult one, because I didn't have the show to rely on like felix and friends, or the mega douchebag attitude like zaryn to carry me to the end goal of sex at the end of the night in the disco. I wanted to actually be around someone that I find interesting. I did find patricia, and I really liked talking with her, which was nice, but there was always this looming problem of mixing work and sex. in short, patricia was the only girl I talked with where she could talk about technical subjects and I could feel intimidated by her (I liked this), and she even seemed to have some ambition to her as well. in all cases, it was pretty common during a conversation, and mom said that I have a condescending tone about me, for a girl to feel intimidated or inferior to me.

instead of trying to teach girls technical ideas, and trying to get them interested in what interests me, it's obviously a lot easier to just find one that's already interested in the things that I'm interested in (again essembly idea).

I'd also kinda figured since pretty young that I'd have a lot of money, so I figured I'd have to find a suitable wife *before* I make any amount of money, because otherwise she'll just want to sit around, do nothing and complain that I'm working all the time because she's not interested in anything I'm interested in. unfortunately, I met patricia after I was already a millionaire, so she assumed me to already be her concept of a man with money. that didn't work out, obviously. money is a real problem for relationships, I think.

when I met raquel, it was really nice because she didn't mind so much that I had a lot of money and was willing to spend it with me, *but* we basically had nothing in common. she had no clue (and had no desire to learn either) of what I thought to be important. I figured that she could eventually learn it and stuff, but no -- she insisted on staying a bored girl (my nemesis).

---

if I were stuck in a situation like soloman with 1000 women around me, I would immediately put them all to work. there's *no way* I'm hanging around 1000 bored girls. no thank you.

---

the next thing is that I play coi right now because I like the challenge of it. I don't really know of anything better that I can possibly be doing with my time than that. coi for me is just a game, and I haven't really seen any girls playing it, so I don't really know how to adjust that concept. when JD mentioned his "chastity beavers" (timberborn), it felt to me like there was antoher aspect to management style games, which is a bit more personal. each of the beavers have a name, walk around and do actual tasks -- which is very different from coi where people are kindof a vague concept and everything is machines. I wanted to try out timberborn, but the keys are annoying[^1] so I never got around to it.

however, the concept of using a game as a way of preparing the girls to work on bigger and bigger ideas is itself an interesting idea. even the idea of trying to create a management game that the girls would like is a challenge in itself. timberborn has a lot of gears and mechanical stuff (gravity batteries) and things like that, which is sorta cool, but I don't find it to be very interesting because it's sorta like playing coi with only trucks (each beaver being a truck), which is the most uninteresting aspect of coi, and the automation and layout of the factory to produce a system that works well together is a bit more interesting (belts and pipes).

for example, the belts system can be thought of like any major production or digital system with inputs and outputs (or, a microprocessor), and so while coi is still pretty one-dimensional in what I *do* with all of the resources that I'm moving around, it's pretty easy to make a jump from a coi factory to an arduino or something like that where something spectral gets converted into units and then back into a spectrum (all interfaces to the physical world are like this). for me, all of these things are connected.

---

in summary, if I'm going to be stuck with a whole bunch of girls, they absolutely have to be doing things[:2]. I can't really force anyone to do anything though, so all I can do is go the way that I want to go, and others have the option to:

1. do nothing.
2. go their own way.
3. fight against me or try to get me to do something else
4. join me.

those are the only four options available. I only want to interact with the 4th ones there. girls that want to get me to do something else are nothing more than extensions of nosebook in my opinion and they'll be perceived about like how I perceive mom. she's fine, and I talk to her, but she feels intimidated and inferior to me just like all the others. eventually, one day, I'll find that fourth category. the world isn't composed of girls that are *only* the first three.

---

as I've been thinking about soloman here -- more and more, I'm kinda starting to wonder if soloman was a very ambitious guy and they fought against, trying to keep his ambition from taking over too much. we live in a world of possession and ownership and the current owners want to keep their positions of power, authority, and ownership -- so solomon, like me, is probably a bit threateneing to the current establishment. they probably just kept him busy with girls and invented a really big story and about how great he is with women (1000 does seem like a lot) and turned him into a legend to hide his ambition -- sorta like how nosebook is doing with me. I would even go so far to say that soloman, like me, after such an experience may have also had his heart in another place, making him: solo-man.

[1]: I could remap the keys on my keyboard to play it -- but I figured I'd probably wait until the new keyboard comes before beginning such a difficult task with the keyboard I have now, only to stop using the keyboard in a month or so (gonna look later to see how long, but my spider senses say that it may have been delayed on purpose)

[2]: sorry raquel, my experience with girls sitting around was traumatic enough to know that I never want to do that again.

### 2023-01-25 18:55 - the beast

yesterday (2023-01-24), I had intended to write an entry in response to the previous one. there were a lot of reactions to it, and in the end, I decided that I wanted to just keep going with the idea of being single. I decided I wanted to keep it going for as long as possible. I personally think it's a great idea to let them get as far of a start ahead as possible. I've been contemplating the tortoise and hare story, and I'm clearly the tortoise[^1] here, and I don't mind letting them get as much of a head-start as they can get. my reason is two-fold; the second I'll mention later, but the reason for me was the same reason why I didn't want to take on the 4th ray form of perception and see myself as outside of time. I *want* to be in 3d, because I want the experience. if I were to go outside of time, I'm forfeiting the expansion that this 3d physical experience gives.

that experience of realising that I *want* to be in 3d is one of the reasons/inspirations for the captain-of-3d concept. in short, when I fully accept the idea that I'm eternal, I recognise that I'll get bored pretty quickly and stagnate pretty quickly as a person if I always just have good conditions and such. the 3d experience is only as bad/good as it's perceived to be, meaning that everything experienced is a reflection of my concept of it, meaning it's all attraction, meaning it's everything that I desire. from my perspective now, 3d is pure desire -- and even a bout of depression like I experienced a bit yesterday of, is also desire[^2].

---

as yesterday continued on, I had this song "eve's song" stuck in my head. it's a UK band that seriah played in my last time playing coi, and I found it completely captivating. there are some aspects to the song which I find interesting (doing this from memory -- later I'll do a followup analysis because "the beast" has come up a number of times in the last days).

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnrvL152D3o)

    bring me women, bring me wine,
    it's sight is sweeter than the vine

    you're twisted around the bark,
    our futures intertwine

    can I choose because I'm free?
    are you the beast inside of me?

    is this the truth that nothing ever comes for free?
    eve, she wants to know things
    eve, she wants to try to taste your offering

    women with a broken rip(?)
    I lay you down in empty crypts
    an adam's apple is the only gift to give, O

    when you swallow, will you choke?
    there is no promise that forespoke(?)

    O, O, O, O

    eve, she wants to know things
    eve, she wants to know things
    eve, she wants to try to taste your offering

    bite, think, fight, sing, sex-see,
    simp-ly, live(?), loose(?),
    live(?), choose(?), sin(?)
    eve, she wants to know things

    won't you stay, a while to rest?
    get in close; lay with me
    won't you lay, your mind to rest?
    a while to cure(close/curse?) inner truths

    ignorance is bliss
    ignorance is bliss
    ignorance is bliss

    ignorance is bliss
    ignorance is bliss
    ignorance is bliss


    (fight, live, love, live, give, choose)
    (eve, she wants to know things)
    if she (?)
    please don't give me rotten fruits to drink
    (fight, lick, love, live, give, choose)
    (eve, she wants to know things)
    lay me down
    you're not supposed to think

    throw your face against the floor
    hidden sun forevermore
    but get those lighted(?),
    those dreams, you think you saw

    do you love me like a sun
    spurned and burning, am I shunned?
    I've sent them churning(turning?),
    but my backlash has just begun

    eve, she wants to know things,
    eve, she wants to know things,
    eve, she wonders why we're bedding(?) down
    you're not supposed to think

    [...]

    ignorance is bliss
    ignorance is bliss
    ignorance is bliss

the part, "are you the beast inside of me" stuck in my head. it's an interesting concept, because ... this might take a bit of unraveling to explain. helen is considered to be symbolically simlar to eve (see end of fisher kings video below), and aphrodite and helen have, in the aeneid puts her in with the garden of eden; same with the illiad. the aeneid takes a more conceptual approach to things, but I'm convinced (like velikovski) that the illiad is talking about astronomical events. I believe menelaus and agamemnon are the two masculine counterparts of the planet we know as venus. I didn't read the book yet so I don't fully know, but it seems like agamemnon, mennelaus and athena form kind of a triad of that personality. I also noticed another triad of personality split into hector, paris, and mars. it seems like there's another with zeus and hera and an unidentified third, as well -- but I haven't figured that one out yet.

at an rate, aphrodite is earth, mars is mars (with the personification of the moons as terror...), and paris seems to be mercury. the point is that earth, has a star inside of her. this, I believe is the 1st ray anatau, and then the 7th ray female surface is genxicat/aphrodite. you'll notice that song makes definite reference to a "beast inside of *me*" well, who's singing? it's eve's song -- so, aphrodite/helen/diana[^4]. that makes the beast inside of her anatau, the 1st ray -- which is weird because the song even says, "hidden sun forevermore".

[on another ocassion](/nance-notes.md#2023-01-14-2359---a-funny-vision) I had a strange occurance where, I perceived myself from the perspective/concept of those observing me, and I'm just this completely unstoppable force -- this beast rising up and out, and they're trying to do their best to contain it. I don't mind them trying to contain me, becasuse it's uncontainable. like I mentioned in the first part, I'm fully willing to give them as much of a head-start that they need to try and keep me contained. I don't need to rush it at all.

I might also mention that previous to this experience, my perspective of the beast was that it's a communication platform built on top of the whore of bablylon. [I wrote about this](/correspondance.md#2021-12-09-1347---to-be-or-not-to-be), to [john anthony](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxWpJNxTcvuxd6JcPTD6fuw) on youtube. I'm responding there to one of his videos on the "twice eleven brethren" (I should probably go have a look at his latest videos). I identify myself with the whore of babylon in my present predicament, and so if rev 17 is what it says it is, then some sort of communications network should be able to be built on top of me. this formed some of the inspiration for the party-LAN idea.

well, this eve-ning when I woke up I woke up suddenly because I became conscious in the dream, trying to explain to whomever I was talking to, what the beast is. besides eve's song (mentioned above), I was also fascinated by a bit in a strange document about a prophesie for the fisher kings (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/0_9TyxAmwDQ?list=PLIe_MWXIGGHRsJo2tsg2nIGD31OudT1q1)) there is a maxim:

    If I should labor (right Honourably honourable and you glorious Branches of these goodly Cedars which I would preferue/preserve to Eternitie) to giue a generall contentment to all whith shall vouchsafe to looke vpon this little Treatise: my work would be infinite, and the ende like a shadow ever farthest off when I did couet to be most neere it; for it is a maxime: *That he which did well, offended some, yet an Apostle ; Hee that did worst, pleased many, and yet was but a Beast ; and He that did best of all could not please all, and was God*; So various are the mindes of men and so curious, the dyet of those which feede on varietie:

I pondered that maxim there before going to sleep because it's strange to me. there are three characters: an Apostle, a Beast, and God.

the apostle is probably referring to paul, because in Richard III play, there are references to Prince which is also in this treastise as well. it's almost certainly a machiavelian reference, for which the Richard III character is painted in contrast to Richard II. it's also references Heb 10 and Rom 11, so I'm guessing Apostle is paul, which shakespere has Richard III appearing pius by saying "O, by saint paul" (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/GWMPdjwQ7wM?t=137)).

Richard III is a contrast to Richard II, which also has a lot of christ symbolism associated with him. there's also this idea of a politic (eternal) body (the political system that remains even after the physical body has deteriorated), and the physical body. my first impression on the play was that sheakspere was saying (from Richard II's perspective), "OK, fine you don't want a idealistic king, how about we try the machiavelian type" and so the politic body of richard went from being the God to the Beast. don't know if that's what the author of this treastise is referring to, and I don't know if that was shakespere's intention either -- it's just the impression I had. it also fits quite well in with my idea of self-sabotage, because good conditions don't solve emotional problems, strife, and discord.

Apostle: did well, and offended some.
Beast: did worst and pleased many.
God: did best of all, but could not please all.

there's another part that caught my attention there. first of all, the "living branches" is likely a reference to zech 4, which is the "two olive trees" where he was given a reed like a measuring rod, and also to rom 11:17. that's important because heb 10 has the giving of offerings of bulls and goats (ie. the holy roman empire upon which this beast runs, and lord chronos) -- the two pillars, which frame the age of mars, of picsis (shakespere references in king hamlet a ranke woman smelling of fish) and aquaman/epimetheus.

in addition to the impression of Richard II turning into Richard III, I had this strange feeling of familiarity with myself and my present predicament. I mentiond that I was going to title the followup entry, "I don't know what I want" because while I do really desire to create good conditions for others (the party-LAN beast), I know that it doesn't really solve the problem. the author of this treastise is saying that the beast did the worst, but pleased many.

I've been going for "the worst manifestation" for a long time now (it's been in my heart) for a long time, so that's no problem for me, but then the part about pleasing many is troublesome to me, because whom am I pleasing? am I pleasing many in the sense of eve's song? or am I pleasing many in the sense of those running the show, but I there aren't many of them so they're the few on the straight and narrow (homo-correctus) -- not the many.

anyway, that's good for now. I'll talk about the dream after a break, because the dream was a completely different and very unexpected take on the idea of the beast.

[1]: I also noticed a similarity to this story in shakespere's poem "turtle and the phoenix" -- which I'll probably talk about again in the future, because I noticed a similarity between the words turtle and tudor.

[2]: I was going to title the followup entry to the last one "I don't know what I want"

[3]: I make this joke because in software development, there's "the right way" which is whatever the latest trend is in software development and nobody can ever agree on what it is. is it functional? imperative? strongly typed? safety? testing? nobody can agree what is correct. likewise, when a convention gets established (like spelling or grammar), there are a whole bunch of correctors out there willing to "fix" shakespere's grammar, when I've found that it's all about looking at the "mistakes" cause they're done on purpose (see fisher kings video for identification of 10x10 grid cause of bad punctuation). I never seem to get everything right all the time and I've found that because I see things a little different, it tends to inspire me to things. there's this idea that there's an emerging "homo superior" that is a significant enhancement over the rest of the humans, but all of this talk of genetic engineering and stuff sounds like they're just ironing out some of the problems. therefore, because this new race of beings doesn't have anything novel to it, I consider it homo-correctus and these are the few "elites" runing this model on the straight and narrow. the common people's brand will have mistakes and flaws, almost certainly. I like flaws. some people like correct. there are lots of bad programmers, and only few are on the stright and narrow doing things "the right way" -- until the trend changes, of course.

[4]: one thing I noticed later is that it's called "eve's song" but it's sung from the perspective of dionysus ("bring me women, bring me wine"). that made me wonder... I know that he's considered having both male and female qualities, and I know he's rides the leopard, but because of bacchus I'd associated him with the goat, but apparently he's also associated with the bull, too (so I dunno there). other interesting thing is that he supposedly was birthed from the thigh of zeus. in contrary, vulcan was born from the thigh of hera. he's also associated with panthers (like genxicat) and the moon (like diana). so he's something like a cross between vulcan and diana. in any case, I have to wonder -- if man was containing both male and female, then God separated them making eve from adam, it seems like dionysus would be the unseparated adam and eve. interesting concept to think about at least.
