# contemplations-with-myself

sometimes I want to philosophise and nobody is there, so I contemplate -- with myself.

### 2022-12-09 15:10 - the desire to be right

today I had a lot of thought on why I want to be right so much. the origin this thought comes from the time when I walked back home from nuvue. I understood the promethian prerspective "for the first time". when I did, I realised that we all have the promethian perspective -- which is the desire to be right, rathar than to feel good. in that moment, I realised that I didn't really want to feel good, so much as I wanted to be right. I adopted the idea that I want to be right more than I want to feel good, and went with that (probably some time around or after marcos).

in previous moments, I just sorta let happen whatever is going to happen (like tuenti or any of the other failures), but what I learned from marcos (who now I believe to be more of a 4th ray (sometimes) in his perception of me). he "got" me, and understood my naivate. however, on the other side of things, marcos really had to be *right* about things, and that really pissed me off about the whole world saying that andrea wasn't going toward me, when every single other sign says she is. I could see it clearly, but marcos (for whatever reason), did *not* want it to happen, and he also really had to be *right* about all of his untruths about what was happening.

I was mostly sad, because in his anguish to maintain his desire physically, he basically was telling me that I'm not perceptive and don't have eyes. it was stupid stuff that was clearly obvious, and this has carried forward into the future. since I moved to vera's house, I basically took up a promise to myself, which is to be *right* about all the stuff that I can clearly see untruths about. obviously that would be too much effort to do *all*, so I'm quite selective with what I want to be right about.

at the moment when I understood the promethian-perspective, I saw how I would rathar be right than to feel good (selectively), and I was very selective of what I wanted to be right about, because I do enjoy feeling good. I can't remember now, but I knew that somewhere this realisation -- wait, no I said that I would begin to "bounce between contrasts" -- because I could see that this was now going to become a big problem because I now *have* to be right about things that are secret in order to progress in life.

then, jason puts out the tesla memories video where I'm realising thmt my current situation is pretty similar to hotel-bound tesla. I'm just stuck here. I'll continue, but you know today I also noticed that another reason to be right about all of this, is actually to be *understood* by people. I get *zero* feedback to know if anyone even understands me (well, non-physical feedback anyway), so how can I even talk about things that explain this and everything else if one (or maybe 2-3) entire layers of perception (and physical frequency ranges), is simply being said to not exist.

I suppose this also has to do with the long-standing snake-bros frustration that our history is kept entirely a secret. I took a different route then them (conceptual-viewing) to figure out what "happened", but I also say with the same mouth that there are infinite pasts which lead to the present, and almost certainly we are not all on the same one. at any rate, this is the part in the relationship when you're sick of getting stone walled, and you say, either I'm right or I'm going another way. so many women know what I'm saying. the thing is, I went and figured it out, but that was because I couldn't understand the past until I understood the astral. it's impossible to explain "the earth was formless and void" until you've seen the living black, and to understand the earth took on the appearance of mars, as a conjugate of their imagination for what they desired from a saviour planet. once you can see the interplay between the layers of perception, all aspects of human history are all understandable.

I don't intend to try and force my version of history on anyone (like I said, we're all on different timelines anyway, and didn't get here the same way), but for those who want to understand the mainstream and occulted versions of human history, I offer my own for both critisisms and improvements. my vision isn't perfect and we all got here different ways anyway, so it's too difficult to say. it is a kind of "manaul for how the universe works" -- draft edition though. the only thing is I cannot convey this version of history (my story) without touching topics like the nature of and progression/expansion of perception, including the extra dimension that the "authorized phenomenon" are projected.

so, sorry about it man. you're doing it your way. you're king of the earth and I'm king of the galaxy, until my hubris brings you to need to bring me back down to inferior levels. I'll enjoy the superior view for the time I can though.

### 2022-12-13 16:19 - the good guys

this morning I woke up thinking about a lot of things. one of the thoughts that I was thinking about is similar to the previous entry where I explained that there is quite a bit of similarity to my situation now and tesla being bound to his hotel room (as a prisoner). that was jason's perspective on it. yesterday, I explained the [new symbolic repeat of the snake temping adam and eve with the "forbidden fruit"](/snakey-thoughts.md#2022-12-12-1135---snakes-and-the-forbidden-fruit) (carnal acts). this was the snake-bros/randall perspective of the same idea (looking from the opposite end). I offered a lot of solutions and said, essentially that it's not necessary to confine me and prevent me from creating the things that I want to create. in the entry, I basically outlined that my projects are more important to me than the girls. I'd rather create somethting than to be sexually involved with girls.

this morning there were a lot of reactions to what I said. I explained how girls cause me (at least experientially) to lose the "big picture" of what I want to create, and the things that are important/interesting to the girl I'm sexually active with distorts my bigger picture to include the things that are important to her -- which would be fine if she valued the same thing as me; and so, one of the reactions was to use girls as a way to remove that big picture; they don't want me to be creating anything. the other reaction was a long discussion (I'm sure) on why it's important that I don't have any earthly heirs -- meaning, no children, and that's a lot harder to control if I'm around girls.

therefore, the conclusion here is to keep me going in my present situation where I'm going to keep holding off on girls until my project is online. this is the same conclusion that I have, but for different reasons. I want to make something, not just do what everyone else is doing. we arrive to the same conclusion, but from different angles.

the next reaction was around the problem with my conclusion -- which is that if I spend the next decade or two  sitting around waiting for my opportunity to make my system, I too will end up old and stuck in a hotel (or some confined/assisted living facilty) because they don't actually want me having the capacity (money or whatever) to make my system.

I think the reason for this is because although my system would work on a pretty dfferent medium (4th ray, spectral), it still has quite a lot of similarity to the 6th ray astral lumiferous ether. I don't know enough to say specifics of what the differences are (that's part of the discovery process), and even if they could maintain control over the astral, it's too big of a problem to have something that can do such a thing, because it's easy to see that another product may want to use the same exact technology (tesla tech, essentially) to broadcast frequencies in the astral range -- and they definitely don't want that.

even if they decided that they would control all of the technology part of it and just lease out "black boxes" that can broadcast/receive on those frequencies, they still wouldn't want people to have synchronised emotions and frequencies. they need us separated and not organised (same reason for no internet). they simply cannot allow us to have a global communication network of any kind. the maximum we can get is facebook.

---

so, I had a look into why they have such a difficulty with us gaining a communication platform of any kind -- and the best I can tell, they believe they are the "good guys". the ones that are setting up this system feel like they're trying to get a superior position over some sort of opposition force -- or something. I had a look into this as well, and this feeling of their perspective doesn't even make any sense at all because I'm fairly certain that the antarctic inhabitants completely control the astral, and it seems that they've been *gifting* this technology to the US govt -- which means obviously that they have a superior system already setup on top (otherwise they wouldn't be gifting it).

my present working theory is that there is already a 2nd ray system (like the one I wanted to create) already installed, which means that I incarnated into this body not to create the 2nd or 4th ray system, but to "gift" the 4th ray system to them as well. who is "them" though? well, "them" would be the "good guys" working for the US govt, and they're trying to get their system all setup. not everyone working for the US govt is a "good guy" though -- and I think that a lot of the "bad guys" were imported directly from germany in project paperclip.

imagine for a moment that it is a 2nd ray system. 2nd ray is a mix of desire and structure. this is basically a "soul" -- and this is everybody's non-physical (above 4th ray midpoint) perspective. that means that their system can create souls (if you want to look at it). combine the ability to create non-physical souls to incarnate into astral bodies, and you can create the wenher van braun and all of the other ss agents needed to start WW1 and WW2, manipulate time and the symbolic narrative leading to this moment. the narrative is important.

this brings me to some recent things I've been considering about the narrative of don quixote. if you think about this 2nd ray system, it has one part el/la unlief/belief and one part desire, you can now see that the narrative elements that are involved here are *our* 2nd ray system. they create souls with machines that accomplish the symbolic goals set out (time adjusts in 4th and 6th as a result), but we do the same with our own beliefs and desire.

in don quixote, the book focuses around romance and the romantic knight that is righting the wrongs of the world. place me now symbolically in the spot of don quixote and replace "romance" with "saviour". the book is hard on romance saying that it's not necessary and that it even kind of makes one look a bit silly to others around. well, I say the same thing about saviours. don quixote is still quite romantic (tim explains this in the video citing one of the passages). well, again there is quite a similarity to me here as well; the entire point of @[snakey-thoughts](2022-12-12 11:35) was to explain "I have solutions" -- and that we can have it all. once the system is put into place, then girls are no longer that big of a problem -- or rathar that it'll have to become a galaxy-sized problem before it becomes a real threat -- and I'm fairly certain that we can extend my scheme to use contrast/drama as the power source for an even larger setup. I claim that my system *is* how source, our universe and all things non-physical operate, so it's not violating anything or causing problem, but actually solving them. in that sense, I am putting out ideas that would make me "saviour" -- so like don quixote, I'm actually quite the symbol of the thing that I hate (saviours).

personally, my position on saviours is that saviours are actually stopping growth, because they're making it no longer necessary to make the decision about how one wants to feel and perceive their reality by providing conditions, like contiually faster/more energy which hide all of resistance[^1] -- therefore, I don't think too highly of saviours. they don't actually fix the problem, but only allow it to go unnoticed for longer.

I would enjoy it much more if others would find a way to feel the way that they want to feel, but obviously I can't do that for others. only others can do that for theirselves, so I must step away from this one and allow everyone to create their own realities on their own. the "good guys" are out there trying to fight against an even more secret elite "military industrial complex" (which I believe, along with most of the nazi party are created entities/egregores). I have to just let them all create their own realities.

---

this leads to the next subject of my contemplation, which is -- if they're all working real hard to be their own saviours and I'm just "gifting" them some lower tech stuff so they can become their own saviours (and give others in the world an opprtunity to feel the way they want, even in controlled conditions), then it seems like I should just go the direction of the girls, right? why keep trying to make a system that is probably already made? it's probably just as good as theirs, and if they come up with any improvements, they're likely integrating those improvements to the technology back into their own system anyway (this is bacon's "new atlantis").

this is a bit of a conundrum for me, because I'm totally fine giving them *all* of the advantage (zero resistance) to create the system that they want to create. they view people like me and my ideas as a threat to their setup, so if I do continue to go with the "ne earthly heirs" setup, then I'm giving them no opposition to getting full control over everything -- as in, there won't be any children born with my perspective, inheritted genetically -- and instead, all people will come to arrive to a form of perception similar to my own (of the individual) all on their own. no saviours.

I was thinking about all the stuff I wrote above yesterday, and the reaction that I was getting last night was that they simply don't think it's possible for me to be around all of you guys and/or any girls and not get pulled in by them. I would [need a better reason to maintain abstinance](/sepehr-thoughts.md#2022-12-08-1954---abstinence-is-the-process-not-the-destination), then.

[1]: I like to think about cars that have their parking brakes on. if you have a weak car, it's quite noticeable. however, if you have a powerful motor, you could go for miles before you realise that you've got the parking brake on. it's like jon's description of microprocessors and softwar. the continually increasing power of microprocessors is completely hiding that software is gaining uncontrollably in complexity. our problems are growing but we can't see the problem because hardware is advancing so quickly.

### 2022-12-13 21:48 - whos desire is stronger?

as much as I try to mostly talk to myself here, I notice that it's still a bit of a group conversation. I don't mind that much, cause it still causes me to think about these ideas... the reaction is if I go with girls, when, and stuff like that...

I still keep my idea that I'd like to "get connected" before any girls, because then I'd be using the girls then as a condition to find my connection -- and I don't really want to do that. if I want to use conditions to get connected, I'll go outside and watch stars until my kundalini rises; it's not really that hard. the real question here is whos desire is stronger? is nosebook's desire to keep me held down stronger than other peoples' desire for me to get out from under nosebook (which, depending on how you look at it, is the precursor for cataclysm)?
