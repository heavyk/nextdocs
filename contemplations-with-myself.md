# contemplations-with-myself

sometimes I want to philosophise and nobody is there, so I contemplate -- with myself.

### 2022-12-09 15:10 - the desire to be right

today I had a lot of thought on why I want to be right so much. the origin this thought comes from the time when I walked back home from nuvue. I understood the promethian prerspective "for the first time". when I did, I realised that we all have the promethian perspective -- which is the desire to be right, rathar than to feel good. in that moment, I realised that I didn't really want to feel good, so much as I wanted to be right. I adopted the idea that I want to be right more than I want to feel good, and went with that (probably some time around or after marcos).

in previous moments, I just sorta let happen whatever is going to happen (like tuenti or any of the other failures), but what I learned from marcos (who now I believe to be more of a 4th ray (sometimes) in his perception of me). he "got" me, and understood my naivate. however, on the other side of things, marcos really had to be *right* about things, and that really pissed me off about the whole world saying that andrea wasn't going toward me, when every single other sign says she is. I could see it clearly, but marcos (for whatever reason), did *not* want it to happen, and he also really had to be *right* about all of his untruths about what was happening.

I was mostly sad, because in his anguish to maintain his desire physically, he basically was telling me that I'm not perceptive and don't have eyes. it was stupid stuff that was clearly obvious, and this has carried forward into the future. since I moved to vera's house, I basically took up a promise to myself, which is to be *right* about all the stuff that I can clearly see untruths about. obviously that would be too much effort to do *all*, so I'm quite selective with what I want to be right about.

at the moment when I understood the promethian-perspective, I saw how I would rathar be right than to feel good (selectively), and I was very selective of what I wanted to be right about, because I do enjoy feeling good. I can't remember now, but I knew that somewhere this realisation -- wait, no I said that I would begin to "bounce between contrasts" -- because I could see that this was now going to become a big problem because I now *have* to be right about things that are secret in order to progress in life.

then, jason puts out the tesla memories video where I'm realising thmt my current situation is pretty similar to hotel-bound tesla. I'm just stuck here. I'll continue, but you know today I also noticed that another reason to be right about all of this, is actually to be *understood* by people. I get *zero* feedback to know if anyone even understands me (well, non-physical feedback anyway), so how can I even talk about things that explain this and everything else if one (or maybe 2-3) entire layers of perception (and physical frequency ranges), is simply being said to not exist.

I suppose this also has to do with the long-standing snake-bros frustration that our history is kept entirely a secret. I took a different route then them (conceptual-viewing) to figure out what "happened", but I also say with the same mouth that there are infinite pasts which lead to the present, and almost certainly we are not all on the same one. at any rate, this is the part in the relationship when you're sick of getting stone walled, and you say, either I'm right or I'm going another way. so many women know what I'm saying. the thing is, I went and figured it out, but that was because I couldn't understand the past until I understood the astral. it's impossible to explain "the earth was formless and void" until you've seen the living black, and to understand the earth took on the appearance of mars, as a conjugate of their imagination for what they desired from a saviour planet. once you can see the interplay between the layers of perception, all aspects of human history are all understandable.

I don't intend to try and force my version of history on anyone (like I said, we're all on different timelines anyway, and didn't get here the same way), but for those who want to understand the mainstream and occulted versions of human history, I offer my own for both critisisms and improvements. my vision isn't perfect and we all got here different ways anyway, so it's too difficult to say. it is a kind of "manaul for how the universe works" -- draft edition though. the only thing is I cannot convey this version of history (my story) without touching topics like the nature of and progression/expansion of perception, including the extra dimension that the "authorized phenomenon" are projected.

so, sorry about it man. you're doing it your way. you're king of the earth and I'm king of the galaxy, until my hubris brings you to need to bring me back down to inferior levels. I'll enjoy the superior view for the time I can though.
