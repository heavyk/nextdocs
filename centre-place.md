### who was king david?

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/fcBnok1c-m8)

- depicted with a harp (sorta like apollo)
- same-sex relations (apollo, lol)
  - notably with johnathan, son of *saul*
- involved with the "deuteronomic history" narrative goal:
  - promoting worship of *only* YHVH (marketing)
  - *centralising* only YHVH worship into the temple site in jerusalem (economic)
  - suffering is happening because the isrealites are not folloing the marketing and economic policies
    - fall away, punished by foreigners, judge gets them back on track
  - Joshua carries forward the ministry of moses, leading them forward as conquerers (like the HRE?)
  - Judges describes the israelites as living without a king, but lead by tribal judges (like the protestant church?)
  - 1&2 Samuel is the story of the final judge (and great prophet), who *annoints* israel's first king, *saul*.
    - *saul* initially prospers, but then "disobeys" God, and so samuel is to annoint david as new king
    - david kills goliath, becoming a war leader, and takes office after the death of *saul*
  - 1&2 Kings telds the story of the death of david, and his successor solomon (who builds the temple).
    - the kingdom of saul, david, and finally solomon is divided into two parts and is destroyed by the assyrians (721bce), then the bablyonians (587bce)
- narrative around david:
  - the judges thing isn't working out so well, and the isrealites want a king; all the other nations have kings, and they want one too.
  - samuel warns against having a king:
    - take your money with taxes
    - make all of your sons soldiers for war
    - take your daughters to be concubines
  - samuel complies, appointing *saul* from the tribe of benjamin.
    - because, he was the most handsome, and really tall (giant?).
      - later, I wonder if this plays into a measuring contest that david has with saul: I don't think david is as tall as saul is, so when he defeats goliath, that's a symbolic, coming of stature to be a great king.
  - saul and his son johnathan are very successful in battle, defeating many of YHVH's "enemies"
    - they're supposed to destroy all pagan (non-YHVH) tribes, exterminating all of their women, livestock, and children, etc. (to ensure no genetic input from them?)
  - because of saul's failure to follow the extermination command of YHVH (it feels like he's a bit too merciful, or maybe even not wanting to be so brutal against innocents), so YHVH rebukes saul through samuel.
  - samuel seeks out a replacement for saul, and finds a shepeherd boy, david.
    - he's also very handsome, and has beautiful eyes (prolly not as tall though).
  - saul has david (unknown that samuel has annointed him to replace saul), to play the harp for him to soothe him from an evil spirit *from YHVH* that's plaguing him (YHVH sounds kinda manipulative here; reminds me of hera).
  - philistine army challenges israelites to single champion combat (very illiad-esque)
    - david is offered saul's armour (used to show the hero in his glory, in the illiad), but rejects it
    - he uses his shepherd sling and some stones from the brook (probably symbolic)
    - the short underdog takes down the massive boasting beast, and so now he's *proven himself* in the spectacle as worthy to replace saul as king
  - killing goliath fires up johnathan pretty hot and they become "soul-mates" as david's reputation grows (reverse achilles and patrocles?)
    - david also marries one of saul's daughters michal
      -- soul-mates with saul's son, and married to his daughter (besides being a bit awkward) means he's in the royal family circle now.
  - saul becomes jealous of david's rise in power and favour with his family, he tries to kill david unsuccessfully twice (like menelaus unsuccefully tries to kill paris?)
  - david as a sort of noble knight:
    - fleeing from saul's court, david joins a group of mercenaries (aided by johnathan)
    - david twice has power to kill saul, but decides not to (he's a good guy), even though saul (the bad guy, fallen out of favour of YHVH has been trying to kill him)
  - david becomes king of judah then isreal:
    - philistines kill saul and most of his sons (including johnathan)
    - david becomes king of judah (the small part)
    - saul's surviving son which is runing over (the larger part) of israel gets betrayed by his servants, and so then david becomes king of judah and also isreal, uniting the two regions
  - david makes capital jerusalem:
    - conquers jerusalem from jebusites
    - brings ark of covenant from baale-judah to jerusalem and plans to build a temple there.
    - YHVH explains that david's son (solomon) will actually build the temple, not him.
  - YHVH makes the "davidic covenant":
    - I took you from low to high (you're nothing without me)
    - I've been there for you (trust me)
    - I've defeated your enemies (your power is my power)
    - I'll make a great name for you (I'll give you glory)
    - I'll establish a place for my people where they can live undisturbed (I'll give you security)
    - no longer will bad-guys oppress you (I'm your protection)
    - I'll give you rest from enemies (go ahead and kick back; I've got this)
    - after you're dead, I'll raise up one of your sons,
      - and I'll establish *his* kingdom (you're not worthy)
      - and *his* kingdom will be forever (cause yours is gonna fall apart -- and it's also a safety net in case his falls apart too because even if his kingdom comes and goes a few times -- don't worry, it's "forever" -- says YHVH)
      - I'll be a father to *him* and *he* will be a *son* to me (undoubtedly I'm setting a good example of this father thing)
      - when *he* does wrong, I'll punish him with losing that kingdom (remember that "forever" thing)
      - my favour won't depart from *him* as it did with saul, cause *your* house (which your son will establish), will endure "forever"
      - and this is my covenant with *you* (though I really mean one of your sons)
  - david's court is a mess:
    - david falls for bathsheba, and abuses his power to kill her husband off in battle
    - david falls prey to politics of competing wives and sons
    - davids's son (amnon) lusts after and rapes one of his other daughters (tamar)
      - david does nothing about it
      - tamar's brother (absolom) kills amnon while he's drunk
      - david doesn't punish absolom for murdering amnon
      - absolom sets himself up as king in judah, forcing david to flee to jerusalem
      - absolom takes over and sleeps with david's concubines
      - civil war starts and david is still saying to "deal gently with absolom" (wtf?)
      - handsome and beautiful absolom dies when his (flowing and beautiful) hair gets caught in the branches of an oak tree, and david's servants kill absolom against david's orders (symbolic)
      - david mourns absolom's death
    - court intrigue continues and david is too aged to lead army against the philistines
  - bathesheba (his favourite wife), convinces david to name her son solomon as the heir
  - david dies, and so soloman executes half-brothers and ascends to the throne.
- a rich but embarrassing story
  - why would they tell such an unembellished story?
  - historians argue that david's story is more likely to be historical because of "criterion for embarrassment"
  - nevertheless, archeology has pretty clearly demonstrated tthat a "united kingdom of israel and judah" under saul/david/solomon is a myth
- northern kingdom was called "house of omri"
  - one of omri's sons was wicked king ahab, and his wife jezebel (who worshipped jupiter/baal)
- deuteronomic history does not date to the era of david, but to the period after the fall of the northern kingdom of israel (house of omri)
  - jerusalem experiences a sudden explosion of building projects
  - correspondingly, lots of literary works, resulting in the biblical source texts
    - dr-ammon says that the hebrew/phonician text was a back-translation from greek, so (if that's true) I wonder if it was during this time that greek was abandoned and hebrew/cananite language made the official with these literary works
  - this activity corresponds to the reigns of the later davidic kings: hezekiah (715-686), manassah (687-643), josiah (640-609), etc.
    - not to the reign of david and solomon
    - it does make sense that these mythological narratives *did* happen, but not here on earth, as earth would be the alternate timeline of significantly more external difficulty (idea incomplete)

[unfinished](https://youtu.be/fcBnok1c-m8?t=4126), as the history of the kings coming afterward are what *really* happened [according to archelogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_Unearthed)... also interesting stuff happens from the fallout from the bronze age collapse.

#### 2023-04-25 19:21 - YHVH a reflection of david

one thing I'd like to point out is not how YHVH's covenant is with david, is a reflection of YHVH, but actually of david. we can learn a lot about david's character through the way that YHVH's "unconditional" covenant is presented (a bit like a dysfunctional parent, imo): "I know you're going to continually let me down, but know that I'll still *always* love you".

we see these YHVH's fatherly compassion on david as a mirror of david's fatherly compassion on his son absolom.

### 2023-04-26 03:59 - another timeline reflection

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/fcBnok1c-m8?t=3940)

in my notes above, I noted that that the later date of the the literary creation of the biblical texts, being off by about 200y or so seemed to make sense to me intuitively. I couldn't really figure out what it is until I saw that timeline there, as it seems pretty clear to me that what used to be this mythological davidic and solomonic kingship at the height of the solar cycle (~1000y before the jesus thing) the greek dark ages are occurring, which corresponds with the "bronze age collapse"...

so, let's say that the collapse was the peak of the solar cycle, and the massive upheaval was actually a *solar* event (and santorini and all other conflagrations and such were secondary effects) -- then, what I can see is that the "exodus" (which is another thing that seems to have little archeological evidence for millions of people going through the desert) would fall right in to the time frame of extreme solar activity and destruction.

I'm still working out the details of how it works, but what seems to happen (from what I've gathered) is that the increae in solar output causes people to become aware of a "light body" or some other existence in the astral plane somewhere else. they seemingly live there and experience normal earth in a dream-like reality -- so what I'm insinuating here is that the davidic and solomonic stories *did* happen, just in that alternate dream-reality (lyra/vega). however, it seems that some people which are astrally aware enough are able to find theirselves back on earth here somehow and they seemingly bring those memories with them. I don't know if they get sucked into incarnation through birth or if they inhabit/walk-in to bodies (or both) or if they just materialise out of nothing; really not sure about any of this because I don't experience the other world, even though I seem to have some awareness of it.

anyway, the idea here of the time shifting, is it looks like everything is about 150-200y off, which means that the "dark ages" there were actually not experienced because that 200y gap would have synchronised symbolically (through the literary works and the construction projects in jerusalem) to the previous solar maximum, allowing them to be connected in time. the big-picture of how all of this time compression is done isn't fully clear yet, but I'm going to keep writing about it until I "figure it out" (ie, manifest it as "reality" for me -- which is all that matters, btw)
what I can say though is that it seems that there are two components to it, which one of them always seems to be a literary connection between the timlines, where one timeline is going along at double the speed (almost certainly the one I'm on), and this double speed timeline is the one of the "weeds" -- those that can survive and thrive under the most adverse conditions. I'm reminded of joseph and job here because it looks like constant tragedy and loss, but in the end, it's always given back as double (time?). like I said, I don't fully get it yet.

### lost 10 tribes

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/0wwVfAQ2-hc?list=PLEnqfPnCRxLKqM_A7vmYc9xZ2xZcg-itw)

- the philistines had come as sea peoples, as invaders from mycenean and greek locations (which is why goliath is displayed like a homeric greek hero in more-or-less greek armour)
  - as often happens when an elite group comes and takes over, they adopted the local language and customs of the majority (cananite) population
- the 12 tribes narrative is likely a constructed courtly narrative
  - jacob works for 7 years for one beautiful wife and ends up with 2 wives and 2 handmaidens. (notice the doubling)
    - it's also interesting to note the weeklong lovemaking with leah, which is a kinda parallel to enkidu in epic of gilgamesh -- so then if upon receiving rachael, he ignores leah for another weeklong, this is enkidu's second weeklong of further domestication
  - jacob then has to work another 7 years (and presumably this is when the birth of the 12 sons take place)
  - with leah, the first but "unloved" (1)
    - reuben (1): "see, a son" / "he has seen my misery" (hopefully he'll love me now)
    - simeon (2): "one who hears" (he heard that I'm not loved)
    - levi (3): "attached" (hopefully he'll attach himself to me)
    - judah (4): "praised" (hopefully, he'll praise/acknowledge me)
    - her character is:
      - attachment and dependency
      - she's sets the tone for the "first" or "not as attractive as the others" type girls.
      - she's in constant competition with the other wives, claiming she's "unloved", yet she bears the most children and has an entire bridal week dedicated to her. I mean, jacob supposedly "didn't know" he was sleeping with her (jacob wasn't blind; rachael is obviously more attractive, so I'm sure he noticed, but chose to go along with it anyway). and then, even after making the deal to get rachael too, jacob still finishes the bridal week with her anyway. the unloved bit was in her head, cause she thought herself as less attractive.
  - rachael (the attractive one) is upset that somehow 4 children have been born to her rival (and less attractive) sister, so she gives her handmaiden bilah to jacob to have children for her (vicarious accomplishment?)
  - with binah (2):
    - dan (5): "I'm vindicated for my efforts"
    - naphtali (6): "my struggle" / "I won"
    - her character is:
      - portrayed through leah (sort of like a puppet/servant), as someone who can vicariously vindicate the injustice of rachael's inability to conceive
      - someone who can vicariously perform an impossiblity for someone else (like having children for them) and achieve the goal/desire
      - essentially: because of racheal's struggle, beliah is her ability to perform the impossible, and vindicate herself (cause leah is supposed to be the best, most attractive one, and she's being shown up by her unattractive sister)
  - now leah sees that bilhah has successfully produced two sons, so, she doesn't want to be outdone and gets her handmaiden/servant to also even mo produce more heirs for her
  - with zilpah (3):
    - gad (7): "good fortune"
    - asher (8): "happy"
    - her character is:
      - portrayed through leah, who's already successfully had 4 sons, she's abundance or extra for team leah.
  - seeing the success of her handmaiden/servant zilpah, leah gets motivated again (mandrakes, are said to be the cause, but obviously this is a result of the abundance/extra from zilpah)
  - with leah, now abundant (1):
    - issachar (9): "reward"
    - zebulon (10): "honour"
    - her character is now:
      - she gave up her competition, it looks like when she offered her servant zilpah to jacob
      - as a result of finally giving up that competition, she now feels rewarded for her having been able to allow her servant/inferior
        - remember, she has "first" complex, being the older one who (undoubtedly) had the idea to compete with her sister and pull the sneaky switcharoo after jacob's 7 years of work
  - finally, rachael decides that she wants to get on the abundance bandwagon and allows herself conceive
  - with rachael, the last (4):
    - joseph (11): "may he add" / "I also want abundance"
      - manasseh (11a): "to forget" / "to lose"
      - ephraim (11b): "twice/double fruitful"
    - benjamin (12): "son of my trouble" -> "son of my right hand"
  - final score: leah/zilpah (8), rachael/bilhah (4-5) (notice the 8/5, venus ratio there)
  - interesting themes:
    - joseph is favourite, but sold into slavery (lost), yet his two sons yield double (and the largest) area in israel (even ephraim means twice/double fruitful). joheph turns 12 -> 11 -> 13.
    - benjamin (the new favourite) comes at the cost of rachael's (his favourite wife's) life; transforming his name from "son of my trouble" to "son of my right hand"
    - joseph is essentially the last, and like levi, doesn't get a portion, however his two sons get the bigger portion of israel.
    - joeseph has the parble of job built into his son's names
    - joeseph, like the drought and plenty which happen in egypt later comes is the product of rachael (the attractive one) finally letting herself accept abundance/fruitfulness (and it took watching her sister leah figure it out first). it's no doubt that joeseph was so favoured and why the other brothers competed with him because he was like the golden child.
    - rachael's second son, benjamin isn't so much about prosperity as joseph, but about completion and finishing; him being born finally, at "the end".
- northern isreal was the powerful faction up until the assyrian destruction in 721bce (judea to the south was much poorer).
- jerusalem's rise only occurs after the northern exiles move to judah in 7th century bce, where they created the biblical narrative (which may be why jerusalem is perceived so prominantly in these courtly narratives)
- quite possible that much of the myths and stories created to honour the ancestry of this "house of david"
- archeology shows that the jerusalem was not likely the capital of the whole united kingdom, so the stories that were created essentially were to set jerusalem and the southern kings (the smaller kingdom), which didn't get destroyed (the north did), connecting them together
  - inotherwords, south is small (like david), north is large (like saul/goliath) and so when the northern kingdom is brought down, the southern wants to make a literary land grab (stake) to having power over the northern kingdom, elevating theirselves above the northern kingdom with literary stories.
- in reality:
  - all of the tribes in that area had a similar language and cultures, so it suited them to paint a picture of there being more closeness and kinship between them than there actually was.
  - there were more than 12 tribes, as the 12 (which is really 13) is a perfect zodiacal mirror (and 12 is also related to jupiter)

### was apostle paul gay?

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/rv8DvdlDYss)

- gay means an inborn attraction to same sex (not sexual practise)
- greek culture made same-sex relations sort of normal
  - pederasty was also normal for an older man to mentor a younger boy, who would then grow up to then mentor another boy himself. it was not shameful, and was actually looked upon as honourable (in cases where the mentor is a good example)
- roman culture is extremely a patriarchal, and so the dominant role was always played by the strong male, and it didn't matter if the passive role was female or male
  - the passive role (if played by a man) was seen as shameful for a powerful man; inotherwords, a powerful man would be shamed if found in a passive role
- israelite culture had the biblical precident of david and jonathan's amorous relationship, upon which YHVH established his covenant for the davidic line.
  - sodom and gomorrah was more about sexual violation (rape) than same-sex relationships.
  - the levitical law forbidding same-sex relations is understood by most to apply only to the priestly class (sadducees)
  - pharisees promoted that all jews should study and obey torah
  - pharisees, sadducees, and essenes observed levitical law
  - paul is a pharisee
- second temple founded by exiles returning from babylon becoming part of the persian province of yehud
- alexander of macedon conquered the persian empire inheriting the province of yehud (judea)
  - important, because remember for the greeks same-sex relations are completely normal
  - judeans reject hellenisation (as a whole), though to some extent some of the nobility accept it
    - I actually wonder if this has been an ongoing struggle with the israelites, because it seems that the philistines were likely micynian or green, though after conquering that part of canan, they adopted the cananite customs.
    - it seems to me that because the septuigent predates the tanakh, the duteronomic reforms were likely a way to take the cananite language and build up an identity on top of it.
- second temple views of homosexual activity is that those are the things that the foregners (gentiles, like the greeks and romans) do, and that it was caused by looking at the pagan idols and their desirous body shapes
- by the first century ce, judeans begun to think of the story of sodom as a command against same-sex activity.
  - so, what if you're a judean and you have an innate attraction to youu own gender?
- the thesis here is that paul is in a world-view that same-sex activity is unnatural and caused by lusting after the pagan gods in their iconic, perfect form depicted in the idols
- paul is a self-proclaimed pharisee, meaning that he was supposed to observe levitical law
- in addition to finding out about paul in his own letters, we can also look at what others wrote about him
- paul thinks (rom 1:22-27) that those that turn the glory of God (conceptual realm) into physical images, caused them to desire the impure (physical) thing, and so began to dishonour their bodies (casually) between each other. therefore, females changed their natural relations into those contrary to nature, and males abandoning the natural relations of females, too enflamed with desire for another worked out their shame with other males (and receiving for theirselves a recompense suitable for their error)
  - it seems to me that what he's talking about is the worship of the physical, and the inability to receive/comprehend the "glory" and knowledge of God.
  - it really has the sense to me that is very similar to me -- and I kinda understand this because it's so easy to got caught up in a beautiful image or physicality of something that it totally blinds one to getting the real message (concept) that's behind the picture.
  - I actually kinda really relate to this passage in a lot of ways and is one of the reason why I'm so difficult to be around girls -- which is simply that I can't hold a train of thought. it's like I can't think properly, and their physical image totally overtakes my capacity to think and feel properly. it's not their fault, right so I don't go around making them wear burkas or something -- it's my problem, so I simply stay away from tha, as it's not helpful to me. I want to actually think, reason, and learn, and not be constantly distracted by them.
  - I can't speak for paul, but from my perspective, it looks like he's trying to take an extreme/shocking position on how much images and the physical form can distract one from the less-physical "glory" (conceptual world) of God.
- paul seems to not understand desire or what causes a person to sexually orient one way or another, and devotes a great deal of time to it in his magum opus (romans)
- paul also seems to want to try and explain/justify himself to others why he's traveling with younger male companions (instead of a wife)
  - again, I can't speak for paul here, but I totally understand his perspective, as it's the same one that I have: women simply aren't productive for getting actual work done. desire for me is not usually physical or sexual. I think paul was actually trying to figure out how things work out, but his own beliefs (the announcement) get in the way of figuring it out.
  - I also notice that paul, like me also has a tendency to try and explain things to other people. when I was younger, others made fun of me for having essentially only male companions myself, calling me gay and stuff -- and I could try and constantly prove to everyone else that I'm not gay, but that's a whole lot of effort, and it only makes it look worse anyway, so really I just let people think whatever they want. paul is so busy here on his marketing campaign, he's totally way too worried about what others think. it's interesting to see how that marketing and focus on image/optics (how one is seen by others) follows paul into the jedeo-christian world.
- paul confesses a thorn in the flesh
  - he admits to having been in a passive role (I believe)
- the contrast to paul is the jacobites (jesus' brother james) who are "poor" (paul dedicates a lot of time to raising money), and also throw a bit of shade at paul with anti-gay slurs
  - they were "just" (leviticus law-abiding)
    - james: man is justified by *works* and not faith
    - paul: man is justifed by *faith* and not works
  - this movement gets exterminated by the destruction of the temple
  - continues to be jewish
- paul does not see the law as necessary, possibly because the law is againt same-sex relations
- paul is in conflict with other "super apostles" claiming that they need law stuff (circumcision, etc)
  - decides that he's fed up and wants to head west toward spain
- jacobite critisim of paul:
  - jude compares them to "sodom ... who in the same manner as they, indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural lust"
  - "these dreamers also defile the flesh, reject authority, and slander the glorious ones"
    - interesting claims, because it paints the picture of paul as a sort of rebel, anti-orthodox, winging it sorta guy" (again kinda like me)
    - "reject authority", isn't like a bad thing, ya, know.
    - "slander the glorious ones" -- lol, sound like not-good-enoughness talking to me (and ironic cause they're almost certainly preaching against idol worship, too).
    - "these dreamers" is probably a reflection on paul's announcement of a coming resurrection, but it's likely also to do with the heavy use of visuals and dreams (again, I refer to seriah playing with the boys here as reference)

### 2023-04-28 05:54 - israelites refejection of greek/helenistic ways

in the other [lecture about david](#who-was-king-david), you talk about how the entire story of saul, david, and solomon (which has same-sex love), is not very historical, and the omri were actually in the northern kingdom during that time -- making all of the origins of israel (from jacob to solomon) all kind of a mythological retelling (a view I know that [others have shared as well](https://www.youtube.com/@Biblemonger)). that entire thing is interesting because it creates a sort of tension where the main thing that YHVH promises to the isrealites is all founded on an activity that paul seems to struggle with in some way. (anyway, paul will eventually reject this law covenant, claiming that faith above works is sufficient.)

what's interesting to me about this is in the explanation, I can really feel the proudness of the isrealite elites that want to try and find their own monolithic solution to all of their problems (everything from religion to culture), and in their efforts to differentiate theirselves from everyone else, they're constantly trying to herd everyone to "do the right thing" meanwhile, it's clear that not even the elites know what the right thing actually is -- and they seem to keep moving the goal-posts in their narrative of what it is to be morally upright and *just*. I emphasise just because "just" implies fairness/equality -- which is a recurring theme in the law between genders, slaves, and foreigners. "just" also implies proper treatment/punishment for actions -- which is also a reoccurring theme, and seems to be what they're continually trying to figure out -- which is how can I just get a code (like tax, moral, or computer program) which tells me the syntax for how I should behave so that I know how to work around the stuff I don't want to do, and to not step on anyone's toes for the stuff I do want to do. (I used to think like that as a child myself; it's very frustrating)

in another sense, when thinking about this, I constantly have this sense that the jews are sort of like the "foil" for the nations of the world (and also to quite an misguided/misunderstood sense the "centre" as well (strange, your channel's title btw that I should bring it up)) -- and I mean it that way because a foil decides that they're going to try and get different results than the normal because they believe or *feel* differently about the same thing. that is largely how you avoid taxes and invent new things, so it's no wonder that they constantly want to be different than the norm. I mentioned centre because the centre wants to be the thing that everyone else revolves around -- but they're clearly not a centre, because they can't be competing with anyone to become the centre. a centre is there because they're the strongest in perception (above all others orbiting around). the centre is also the most generous, and least retalititory as well (you don't want impacts if you're a star or planet, cause that's bad).

you know, thinking about it, this foil/centre attribute is actually quite strong amongst gays as well: they dare to be different than the norm, and hope to get different results, as well. I totally get it. I'm gonna end now.

### 2023-04-28 06:54 - my take on paul

my reading of 2 cor 12 is a bit complicated because I'm just starting to learn greek, but it's basically saying that paul has this great vision under very unusual circumstances. he seems to think that the romans will know what he's talking about (the visionary experience at least), and then explains, "I've got this really great message/announcement to share, but they shouldn't take me as hawty, boasting or praised too much that I've got the best message (lol) -- because a pricking in my flesh has been given to me (more than once) by an angel of saturn (satyr), that he could repeatedly pound me in order that I don't become too elevated". it feels pretty coded in euphemisms, but the sense that come to me when looking at the words there is that he's been put in the passive role multiple times, and that he's seemingly not that worried about it.

I actually think that understanding male relations is actually the key to understanding early christianty because -- I'm not totally sure about all of the details because I've no experience -- it seems that whatever happens to a man when he's in a passive relationship like that decreases his resistance and allows him to be more receptive to ideas and new forms of perception. I think that gay sex was a sort of virus that spread in the sense that it was probably the first time that astral vision was first ever perceived by "mortals". they didn't need to be elite or have the super bloodline whatever to be able to see an extra dimension and to begin to let their conceptual/eternal self to express itself in the body.

I'll explain from my perspective: when I was growing up, I saw a flat 3d world where it looked like I was looking at a screen the entire time. I found out through the use of ayahuasca that I can see another dimension, and then in the second session, I figured out how to trick my mind into seeing the extra dimension. I then figured it out staring into stars and stuff like that. in thatt extra dimesion of space, you can let your conceptual perception manifest itself into that space -- meaning that you can conjure 3d images from your imagination and project them into space. the higher up you go, the more intimate you can get with your concepts -- cause let's say you understand physics -- then, you can run motors in that space and interact with physical stuff. or, let's say you're a story guy -- well, you can conjure your character and interact with him/her as if they were there. it's your own archetypes, and your own manifestation of those archetypes into concepts, but what's important is that they give you insight into anything you want to know about yourself and your beilefs. this capability is *ultra powerful*, and that's essentially what paul was doing when he's talking about these hyperbolic revelations in the "third heaven". he's interacting with his own archetypal beliefs made manifest into 3d space.

it's quite a powerful capability that was given to paul, and it's essentially this capability that I believe he (and others) passed on through male relations, to get people into this world of reaction where they're perceiving (non-physical) symbols of their own beliefs or of the beliefs of those around them and then turning them into an entire experience (like the book of revelation). I actually think that paul was right: everyone who had that developed spiritual/astral body *did* get taken to heaven/vega at some point in time, as well.

### 2023-04-28 08:13 - misunderstood paul

the more I read paul in the greek, the more I get the sense that nobody has any idea what on earth he's talking about. he's an extremely conceptual guy. he reminds me a lot of vulcan (as I know him, anyway). like me, he thinks deeply on these subjects and he's writing in a way which reflects his depth. I do wonder sometimes, how much of what I write, people are actually understanding... it's an interesting thing for me to think about because I try to write on multiple levels now (as much as possible), where the surface text is often times offensive and shocking, but I put inside of it lots of things that only illuminate when you have as many concepts connected together as I do; and because I speak mostly from inspiration, I even notice myself connections between my own concepts that *I* wasn't even aware of. it's easy to misunderstand a person like paul/me, and I think that's part of his hidden greatness of being able to make verses which one person can read one way to support the very same point that another person uses against it.
