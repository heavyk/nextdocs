# bob (the tomato)'s blah blog

I'm gonna try a new thing where I type out some things that I normally wouldn't type out -- mostly because they involve other people and I don't really want to put them too much on the spot. what I mean is, I don't have any problem with my life being public, but I definitely occlude the identity of various people and related ideas in noseblog/newblog.

I don't recommend you take anything I say elsewhere too seriously, but even less so here. I'm just going to dump out ideas talk random things through.

well, here goes...

---

I labeled it with bob because I had an idea after listening to a snake-bro's episode, when russ mentioned "pickle rick", I thought about writing out some of the more funny cucumber stories. I haven't done so, because its a bit unnecessary, but if I have something like larry's "picklepick", I can have bob and larry (plant heros -- and, making me "el seed") supple-mental goofing around zones to play in too. the thing is, I want to write more things down, but I feel like if I write them in newblog, they get taken too seriously and sometimes I don't feel inspired to write anything in particular, so I just want to just drool mentally like a newborn, lost in my own world (it's hard to explain). I mainly just want to listen to music and write about less-serious things.

### 2022-04-04 04:23 - triads in encanto

one of the things I noticed in "encato" is that the triads are two females and one male. there may be others but the ones that stand out to me are in the very beginning it shows the original 3 children the abuela has (seen best at 02:35). it may be the case that more of their identity was revealed, but I the movie is really fast-paced and my brain is slow to absorb so much visual information.

however, later on there is a triad of generations. I believe that bruno, mirabel, and the abuela

```
       augustin
       julieta (healer) 
abuela /    
  +   ---- bruno (time)
pedro  \
        pepa (tormenta)
        felix

pepa (seed) & felix (lucky/successful):
- dolores (hears everything) (many pains)
- camilo (shapeshifter) (helper to the priest)
- antonio (beastmaster) (flourishing)

julieta (youthful, love's child) & augustin (great/magnificent):
- luisa (strong) (renowned warrior)
- isabela (graceful, pretty & perfect) (God's promise/oath)
- mirabel (male & female name meaning wondrous beauty)
```

in the very beginning it's revealed that the family madrigal is a *constellation* of brightly shining stars. except for bruno (brown dwarf??), the entire family is females that acquires normal men to produce more gifted children. mirabel sings about how she wants to shine (have brightness) like the rest of them 

- bruno's vision causes disruption in beliefs (doubts).
- when mirabel saw the cracks, luisa became weak
  - therefore, mirabel is somewhere between abuela and bruno
  - mirabel is the "ground"


mirabel kinda represents a combination of all of the family's gifts, but undeveloped or still inside of her:
- mirabel's dress has flowers on it
- mirabel has the combination of qualities from her mother and two sisters.
  - in her opening song she says that if she had a miracle, she would:
    - move mountains (luisa)
    - make new trees and flowers grow (isabela)
    - heal what's broken (julieta)
    - show this family something new -- something inside her (no one)
- the tucan that tells antonio to bring everyone inside of his room, is also there to show mirabel the way through bruno's time den, and she follows it

- there's an entire song saying that everything that bruno says comes to pass.
- when pepa was about to get married to felix, on wedding day, bruno thinks it's a funny joke to tell pepa that it looks like it's going to rain and she causes it to rain on her own wedding day
  - meaning, that bruno is a known trickster that is known to cause someone to sabotage their own good conditions by putting a prophecy or ideas into the person's head.

bruno tells:
- isabela that
  - the *light* of my dreams would be promised and someday would be mine
  - her power would grow like the grapes on the vine
- dolores that
  - the man of her dreams would be just out of reach (betrothed to another)

dolores overhears mirabel tell augustin that the magic of the house is fading and antonio says "miercoles" (day of mercury) and then mirabel says, "she's going to tell everyone" (mercury is the messenger god)

- bruno means brown (and everyone believes him)
- julieta & autustin
  - sound a lot to me like july and august -- very roman empire
  - very white
  - augustin, meaning great and magnificent, is nothing of the sorts; he has alergies and no gift (tells mirabel that it was intimidating at first)
- pepa & felix
  - felix is easy going (lucky) but clearly dark-skinned
  - pepa is very moody and white
  - all their children are brown (bruno)

the three little kids that are asking mirabel what her gift is:
- light-brown kid with coffee
- black girl
- white girl

I get the impression that the white people are always concerned and moody, but the (adult) brown ones seem to be much more chill
- the beastmaster kid, who, before he gets mirabel's stuffed animal and mirabel takes him to get his beastmaster gift, was very nervous and shy.
- felix (in good cheer) was willing to reveal why people don't talk about bruno, while pepa was not willing and stormy.
- dolores went to tell people the secret that augustin was going to enforce that nobody should say

there's this whole wierd part when mariano is going to propose that mirabel is trying to keep the secret, but dolores is insistant on telling everyone.

this whole secret thing in the movie strikes me as weird because dolores hears everything, so it seems like she would have previously been quite the snitch telling everyone's secrets to everyone else. I wonder why she is so intent on telling this one? what makes mirabel having recovered bruno's vision something she wants to share so badly?

the beasts also seem very very interested in reassembling the vision in its entirety, meanwhile everyone else is trying to keep a secret.

---

so, I'm still processing all of the symbols there. all of that was mainly just to keep processing it more. what I was thinking about mainly was the two females one male triads.

what started it all was when I was writing @[newblog](2022-04-02 03:55), I was trying to figure out who unessa was.

to give a background to this problem, in the sirian-guide, there is a very puzzling thing that I didn't understand, which was it always said that unessa is venus. there are two problems with it:

first, I'm pretty sure they're referring to the planet venus, and *not* the goddess because they say, "Isis was loved, Unessa was admired, Genxicat was desired and Anatau was feared." (not sure if it's relevant but they also say that vulcan was amired), so genxicat was the desired one, which is clearly the goddess of desire and love labeled in the mythologies as venus. well, the problem with "her" being a planet is that I get the sense that have planets as masculine entities, even though they call planets "collectors of solar energy"

second, the other problem is that they say that unessa loved mars (allayandra), a smooth-talking 7th ray male warrior:

> Allayandra loved Venus; these stories are still around in the form of Mars and Venus.

> Dwul Quinn is Unessa's grounding agent which added to Quinn's more than somber nature and also accounts for the legends of the beautiful Venus being married to the ugliest god.

well, the mythologies talk about *vulcan* being married to aphrodite, and that he was quite a hideous blacksmith with probably club feet and a limp. aphrodite was the one that is said to have slept with mars.

vulcan is paired with genxicat (aphrodite), which checks out, but genxicat isn't venus -- unessa is venus (which is the one that loved mars)... so, is unessa the same as genxicat?

to further complicate the matter, there is a polarity swap between  saturn (+-4) and vulcan (-5+). for males, they input their opposite ray and output their opposite, so 2/6, 3/5 or 1/7. however females input their same ray type that they output, which leads me to believe that females' polarity swap is 3/7, 4/?, 2/6, 1/5.

so that's the problem... I haven't figured it out yet, but this movie got me thinking about it a lot because isabela is most like genxicat. she struggles with being "perfect" and has this realisation and breakthrough with mirabel that she doesn't have to be perfect -- she can be messy and crate asymmetrical, prickly things. genxicat, always being the image of men's desire had an identity crisis (who is she, if she's not the "perfect" image?)

so, that makes unessa dolores. there's a weird thing where bruno tells dolores that the man of her dreams will always be out of her reach and betrothed to someone else. isabela doesn't really want to be with mariano. mariano comes from the latin name for mars, and also sounds of a concatenation of "mar" (ocean) and "iano" (possesor of). it sounds a lot like the name, maria... which in my best estimation is "mar" + "the maker of" -- the maker of the sea. so mariano is posesser of the ocean (neptuno?). the internet says marius is latin for mars, but if I remember right, "us" is the genetive case, meaning possessor of the ocean. so, I dunno there..

---

anyway, when thinking about dolores being unessa, I had this crazy realisation that mirrors a lot of reactions that I get all the time in regard to patricia. I don't know her position in nosebook, but I would imagine that she probably "hears everything" and has lots of statistics on it too (I had always associated patricia with unessa).

so then later when I was in the bathroom, I was sitting there and I had this "vision" sequence (call me bruno here) of this thing (this isn't the first time it happened -- see next entry) where I started to think about her in the context of these two female one male triads.

the sirian triads (MFM) have two input/output types: the female and the ground, so I would expect a FMF triad to have something similar as well. because I dont have data to say one way or another what the female polarity swap would be, I figured that I almost certainly can play one of those transceivers. it reminded me of my speculation on the vulcan/genxicat and the virtual 5th ray triad.

I noted that vulcan has a polarity change and he is (-5+), meaning that he essentially behaves like a female in that he is primarily receptive. I also noted that they mentioned a first ray male of allayandra (mars) combining with anatau to form a first ray male (meaning input 7, output 1).

- genxicat (-7)
- vulcan (-5+)
- allayandra + anatau (+1)

that makes genxicat the emitter, which if my polarity ideas are correct, then she'll input 7 output 3. there's also a thing about the initiation where the monad communicates directly, releasing the solar angel (something like that). I already believe myself to be at least 2 inhabiting the same bodies -- and quite likely a female too.

so, let's just say that what if one of those personalities is allayandra and one is anatau, then I would behave as a first ray would. this doesn't seem at all out of the realm of possibilities for me, as I most definitely identify most with either a 1st ray male or a 5th ray male.

remember the dragon in rev 12 with 7 heads and the sirian's admonition that they are intending to work on "all at once". they make very clear that you have vehicles on all of these planes of perception, yet are not aware of most of them. so, the goal is to be able to transmit and receive on all 7 (that's 14 capacities). I believe that, like the dragon in rev 12, will have 7 sets of eyes in 7 different worlds.

as such, it's my continued goal to find ways to find more and more ways to transmit and receive on all of these planes simultaneously. when this happens, the "first ray life wave" will happen -- which is basically sirian speak for initiation of a new cell, person, planet, star, galaxy, universe, etc. any time you have the "serpent biting its tail" that is the first ray life wave.

they say that the 1st ray has all of the active intelligence of the 2nd and 3rd ray, and that the 6th is a reflection of the 2nd, and the 4,5,7th are reflections of the 3rd -- therefore a first ray life wave is just a 7-headed dragon -- the serpent biting its own tail -- the 7th and the 1st together (kinda like allayandra and anatau).

I said all of that because I wanted to basically make the case for the idea that I'm working on all phases of perteption. the secondary iplication here is that it enables a whole lot of other triads that were never possible in their "pure ray energy" triad relationships.

---

the final piece to this puzzle (for me), is to imagine vulcan in the form of a female (the opposite of unessa). the thing I don't understand is the polarity swap. if my polarity sway idea above is correct, opposite polarity vulcan is genxicat. however, if I'm wrong about that, then opposite polarity vulcan is venus/unessa.

going back to the mythologies, vulcan is said to have emerged from hera -- which is the opposite polarity of jupiter. in my estimation, jupiter is most certainly a 7th ray male, "A SEVENTH RAY does enjoy playing around creating illusions within the framework of a sexual relationship but this can become a problem for them for as with everything with a SEVENTH RAY, they may confuse the real and the illusion" which is (IMO), a very accurate description of zeus/jupiter.

another strange thing in the mythologies is the strange connection between athena and vulcan. it's unclear who was jealous of the other creating the other, but it seems that athena is the polarity swap of zeus and vulcan the polarity swap of hera. hera is also said to shapshift and was also very beautiful. I would say that hera is 7th ray female. I have no idea where to put athena being a goddess of wisdom something similar to the female verson of solomon.

it all gets very confusing for me to think about all of this stuff. as such, I prefer to think instead about the possibilites of creating my own reality.

---

anyway, the vision sequence involved me and patricia as the trancievers and then a whole bunch of 7th ray female emitters. the impordtant part of the vision is that I passed off to patricia the position of "king" (ie. polarity swap). the other thing the vision did was reveal a potential solution to previous thoughts I had in @[newblog](2022-04-02 00:43), where I figure that there needs to be an interface where people can put their desires and vote for them. at some critial mass, the desire gets implemented. that makes the people the desire -- so we then need a bunch of 7th rays. supposedly the 7th ray is coming into power, so there should be no shortage of them. like the 1st ray, the 7th ray has all of the active intelligece of the 6th and the 5th, but it'll choose to neglect one or the other favouring something that aligns with the physical better. since the 6th aligns much better with the physical, I imagine most 7th ray perceivers neglect their conceptual (5) side the most -- hence my trying to figure out a 5th ray triad.

most of the stuff I write in these are 5th ray concepts (and 5th ray more closely aligns to 1st and 2nd than to 7th), so if there has ever been a good salesperson for 5th ray perception, it's me. undoubtedly some actually see it as useful at this point.

OK, that's enough for now. I really can't believe how inspiring the encanto movie has been for me; it's really cool, and I really like the animation and charactor design.

P.S. I didn't even share my ideas on the triad of abuela, bruno and mirabel, lol. next time...

### 2022-04-04 11:39 - continuing...

I left off last time with the part on the triad of the abuela, bruno and mirabel. they appear to me to be a 1st ray triad. however, it could be a 2nd ray triad too. what I mean by that is that abuela clearly is 2nd ray, though she's much less isis and more jeortau.

there are serious flaws in both of these appearances. she's more jeortau in her belief that she has to preserve the miracle for everyone ("I was given a miracle -- a second chance, and I was so afraid to lose it") -- and another thing about sacrificing and saving which I can't remember where it is now. she's not very charismatic either like jerotau is said to have been.

so in considering the other case where she's more like isis, again she doesn't fit entirely because isis doesn't feel to me like the type of person that would try and hide something that's falling apart and try to enforce it with secrets and appearance -- though I could be wrong on that; I wasn't there.

the way that I see it, a 2nd ray is really good at seeing connections between things, good or bad, and 3rd rays seem to take things more from a sequential perspective. in this sense bruno fits perfectly -- where he's using people's past reactions to predict his own future, whereas a 2nd ray is much more enthusiastic about making connections to save something, solve a problem, or bring a apparently ideal relationship together.

I suupose it's possible that a 2nd ray that feels everything is not good enough could go out of their way to try and hide things that are not good enough or fall short of their expectations. even luisa complains that no matter how heavy things get and pressure, there's continued measurement and expectations which feel impossible to fulfil... I'm just going to conclude that it's a 1st ray triad with mirabel as anatau, abuela as jeortau, and bruno as sanatau.

---

so the reason why I said it that way is that makes abuela the emitter (she runs the show afterall), and the others the supporting roles. now, if we just look at the generations, abuela produced bruno which is essentially the transition (opposite polarity) between abuela and mirabel. you can see that mirabel at the beginning of the movie adheres to a lot of abuela's same behaviours (abuela neither has a gift), and so therefore is essentially an exact replica.

OK, now going back to patricia: in that other setup she would be abuela, I would be bruno and maribel would be the other various emitters. in reality, both patricia and the other girls are both emitters, so this creates a bit of a problem for me.

the reason why I haven't wanted to get involved with this stuff until I'm fully connected is because I know that even in a fully connected state, I'll still be quite affected by all the different girls and all of their varying forms of perception. you see, I really like my form of perception, and I'm not really all that interested in other people's forms of perception, no matter how pretty or attractive they are. a lot of different girls would essentially make me go all over the place. even the tiny amount that I've been around girls (maybe only at becky's house), I found it miserable because there are so many misconceptions that I just don't care. I don't want to sit there and mansplain everything I think that they're thinking. the quantity of "not good enoughness" that I felt just in that short period of time was overwhelming to me. I just didn't feel good about anything.

it seemed to me the way that sarah was presenting it, the teen years would only make that not good enoughness worse to the effect of actually believing that you're actually inconsequential -- and so therefore, you have to join a club of cool people in order to feel substantial.

I have a note to write an entry in newblog called, "family dynamics (individuality & charisma)" -- and I wish I had of done so, cause for anyone listening in, this part will make a lot more sense: when looking at all interactions from a 3rd ray (A+B+C, then D is coming next) all interactions are perceived in the form of symbols or archetypes (or, if you're a statistician, groupings)... the problem with looking at yourself as interacting with your world in reference to a statistic or a norm, means that you need something to set you apart from the rest in order to have any charisma. generally speaking, from that point of view, if you're 50 percentile or lower (pick your metric) then, you're "not good enough" -- and if you believe otherwise "you have your head in the clouds" or "you need to get a grip on reality" -- that you're a no-impact cog in the machine.

to aviod this no-impact cog in the machine dissonance, you have to join an association that is someting -- whether it's a futbol team, football team, basketball team, stonecutters, masons, businsess lounge -- whatever, and if they're winning, then you can finally accept that you could also be like the others in the association -- winning.

---

so as I was contemplating this idea about patricia, I noticed two things: first, there was a reaction that she didn't really want to be involved in relationships. almost certainly she sees them from the "aerial view" and knows how much of a sham the entire relationship debacle is -- probably lots of statistics to back up her suppositions as well. if I were in her position, I would definitely have done my research just the same. I came to the conclusion that relationships are larely a lot of low-self-esteem people trying to leverage someone else to justify their feeling better about theirselves. IMO, yuck. no thank you -- so, that makes two of us.

the second reaction that I had was one of comparison to others in probably body shape, appearance, etc. cause it felt quite a bit like "not good enough"

---

if that setup were to go through, I think what would happen is that I would become the female, and she would be the ground: I would be allayandra+anatau and she would be vulcan.

you can probably see the problems with that right off.

so, what I'm trying to do is to figure out how to do the abuela, bruno, mirabel setup. it would be just as it sounds, and I would be bouncing between a lot of confused perspectives of "not good enough", essentially puting all of the responsibility on me, and I'm sorta like bruno in that I'd rather just hide out behind the kitchen and let them create their own reaities. when it all falls apart, mirabel will finally seek me out (I suppose).

I suppose that another way to look at it is a two-way transmission where patricia is passing her implementation desires (she's vulcan the master craftsman now -- and this is in reference to constructing solutions to those voted desires) down to the girls to ultimately do a lot of the work, and I'm passing the girls perspective of "good enough" (hopefully) back up to her.

at the moment, it sounds kinda shakey to me.

---

there's a reaction, "wow, kenny even more candid" -- kinda a feeling of disbelief... lol yeah, I guess.. jaja

### 2022-04-04 18:07 - not-good-enoughness

I was laying there thinking about not-good-enoughness and I decided that I want to start getting into the habit of thinking out loud in here.

the first recognition was that tesla had a lot of not-good-enoughness going. he did kind of mention it in a few places in regards to why he hasn't married, but, in a lot of cases, he was so far ahead of so many people perceptually, it's difficult to relate to them.

I understand this quite well, as I find my perspective to be so different, I often saw myself as ahead or something like that (not really superior -- just they didn't really match my quality standards). this changed a lot when I got to spain as I had to actually hire and interact with people (alcohol helps a lot too).

for most of the time I was in spain, I would compare myself to other dudes who were "picking up chicks" and notice how not-good-enough they were -- and really, most of the guys out there are complete boneheads.

but, like I said -- it's counter-intuitive, but if I'm out there pointing the finger at all these other guys and saying, "wow he's definitiely not good enough for her" -- the thing is I'm only noticing my own not-good-enoughness in other people.

what I'm saying is that "quality standards" were actually inhibiting me -- and I know this to be true because as I stopped noticing how not-good-enough other people were, the more people started to think I was good enough.

when I stopped noticing how not-good-enough all people are, I also stopped noticing my own not-good-enoughness. I never said, "I'm not good enough for her (or whatever)" cause I'm too proud for that. instead, I would just notice how much better I am than they are.

so, what I'm saying is I stopped noticing how much better I am to other people -- meaning, I no longer felt the need to compare myself to other people to feel good about myself.

---

in summary, my own not-good-enoughness came about because I was watching a lot of people in the discos, bars and such and noticing a lot of really not-good-enoughness in other people. that lead me to live a life of comparisons and, I bolstered my self-esteem by comparing myself to and noticing those others that never could measure up using my quality standards.

as I stopped caring about others not-good-enoughness, they just became other people and I stopped caring about how well they measured up to my quality standards. just the same as in "effortless power", the process of stripping the gun of all of it's physicality, leaving just an inert concept behind -- people just became concepts of their own creation which interact with each other in predictable ways (ie what they're attracting)... and who cares what they're doing anyway.

so, by stripping all of these concepts of their physicality[^1], they became pure illuminated orbs of brilliancy to me. just like when meditating, you stop thinking (physical) thoughts -- well, this is the conceptual version of that. take the physicality away from the concept so that it can be perceived, no matter the circumstances for its brilliancy underneith all of that physical crap on the exterior. as you do this for others, you do this for yourself and you, yourself become brilliant and radiant like a star.

---

this process of removing the physicality from the concept is kind of the antithesis to romance (latin, spanish, etc.) interactions. the reason why all of these songs and movies, telenovelas, etc. emit such a powerful emotion is because they have in them so much physicality wrapped up in the interactions. for example, in encanto, if the abuela hadn't have got so angry with mirabel for ruining the miracle, the movie wouldn't have been nearly as emotionally impactful. though, it's just a normal response when someone feels responsible for something falling apart and they feel helpless to save it.

I try to understand these interactions so that I don't have a strong emotional reaction to them anymore. I learned that a strong emotional reactions create tremendous friction which are usually a waste of energy, but if one knows how to manipulate the concept perceptually, one can take all of that strong negative emotion and turn it into pure euphoria. I attempt to do this, and I even write (on purpose) reaction pieces, because I know that wanted-and-unwanted-are-same. I plow forward heading straight for disaster knowing that it's all a perceived disaster from one angle and from another it's wanted. so why not, like the latin romance crap (novelas, shows, etc.) pump up the not-good-enoughness?

small confession: do a brief look back and notice how much the not-good-enoughness angle has come up; it's quite significant, and I would venture a guess that most of the people following this *also* resonate with not-good-enoughness. I used to really have this *a lot*, and it's only been somewhat recently when I've gotten really serious about stripping the concept from its physicality.

I've never worried too much about all of the reactions to not-good-enoughness though because it's all perceptual and that mainly means that my auience mostly has high quality standards as well. there's nothing wrong with high quality standards -- it's just when they're put in comparison. a desire isn't a comparison. a desire is a desire, and my desire doesn't need to involve anyone else. it's just something that will happen naturally when my reality reflects it.

that means that the quality standards are just a distraction from what's really important which is my perception. as an example, try to sustain a feeling of bliss without meditating. if you can, then that means that you aren't thinking any thoughts in opposition to that bliss. the bliss is always there -- just the other crap makes the bliss hard to feel. likewise, the high quality stuff is always there, just the idea that you want to stay away from the low quality stuff keeps the low quality stuff in view.

look at it in the negative now: we're programmed (mostly by the television -- hello cnn/fox news, aida, muchachada nui, etc.) how to react to things, and we just repeat the reactions like the actors do. is that really how you want to react, or would you rather understand what attracted the interaction and therefore the reaction?

the reaction is the objective, for both hollywood and for LOA. if you want to react a certain way because you like how it feels, then you're seeking (attracting) the action to give you the reaction.

I used to try and explain to people in the bars that the television (most notably the news) is just a reaction programming service. I don't remember when exactly I gave up (probably in augusto's bar), but by the time trump got into office I had completely given up on trying to explain this concept, deciding to instead pick my reaction type. so, starting with colbert and meyers I decided to just laugh at it all. people reacted to me laughing at trump, which at that time, most people in spain thought that spelled the end of USA being taken seriously. they were kinda right, and they hated me laughing so hard at it all falling apart (which is probably also a programmed reaction).

anyway, the programming is everywhere and once you strip away the physicality from the concept, not only do you get effortless power and very fast manifestations, but you notice that the entire planet is just a bunch of barely conscious automatons reacting the way they're taught to react.

for example (song I'm listening to):

> do you want to stay? can't erase the pain; stay away ... stay away

lol

---

last thing, notice how I felt dissatisfaction to commit on such a profound note (about stripping away the physical from the concept to allow the brilliance to be seen)? well, it was too profound, so I returned back to write that reaction piece at the end. I just can't help it. it's what people want. they like to react to things. I've tried to hold profound conversations for extended periods of time and people can't handle it. I have to throw in some "shock jock" stuff to keep people distracted from what I'm really saying. I talk mostly for my own sake, so it's fun when I can get an audience and hold their attention for a while (for reals, sometimes I really have strong 2nd ray qualities)

very last thing: I'm noticing that this blog is going in the direction of being even more hyperbolic than the previous ones. I'm going to write almost anything that comes to mind -- so, the extremes will be far more: more profund *AND* more reactionary.

I think it's fun so don't take it too seriously :)

### 2022-04-06 21:52 - not sure (rename)

the last few days I've been going over that one idea with patricia that I put a few entries back. some hours(?) after I wrote it, I had the idea, "I should just send her an email" (cause I know her email by memory). every time I thought about it, I got a pretty negative reaction from mr. motor on it, and then today because I kept thinking about it, his reaction got even more detailed. it feels like she has some high level security clearance, and I'm kinda like the opposite of security -- so it creates a bit of a problem.

---

yesterday, the plan I was concocting in my head -- and it's hard to say where exactly the idea was coming from but I went with it anyway -- was to just email her and say something simple, then if she wanted to reply to me that's cool. then, if we should meet, I suppose I didn't really know what would happen -- but, as I mentioned in a previous entry, I'm sticking to the derek plan, so I would just hang out with her and stuff. I imagined that we could talk about quite a lot of things -- though, I'm not so sure about that now. I'm fairly certain that I'll do most of the talking and she probably wouldn't be able to say a whole lot -- sorta like how it was when I was with chris in LA.

in combination with other things like that dream I had with nassim, I would imagine that through some way or another, I'll make it out to california -- and like I don't know how necessary it is to be in a single location for her either so it's possible she may end up there as well. I clearly don't know...

anyway, the "vision" (it's not visual) sequence played out something like going to california and working with derek and nassim, and probably a few others on ... stuff, I suppose.

there was another element to it which a long time ago I said that if anyone wanted some sort of performance out of me, then I simply had to practise for it because there's no way that I'm ever good at anything the first few many tries. so then, in california, I would practise with the other girls for a while, and then later on, maybe it could be her birthday or something, eventually, I'll be ready to go with patricia.

there were other elements to the sequence but I simply can't remember them now. those are the essential parts though.

yesterday, I wrote [a bunch of crazy ideas down](/random-notes/1024y-offset) and then went to bed. I can only imagine how my thoughts on time slicing, the paper's acknowledgement that there are *gravity anomalies* around the planet and an erratic polar position (ie. precession isn't happening as expected). I chalk all of these things up as support for my hair-brained idea that we're 1000/1024y earlier in time than we thought -- but for someone involved in that stuff you can imagine how paradigm shattering it is to have *gravity anomalies*. this is a pretty big problem and it looks like the top guys in the US military know and are likely covering up a lot of "unexpected" and "baffling" results.

almost certainly this really did a lot to strengthen their fears of me interacting with someone with security clearance... I say that because I woke up this afternoon thinking about how I think that whole vision sequence is a really great idea, but I think I'd rather just go for ultimate disaster. let me see if I can explain it.

to understand this next part, I have to involve the conversation I had this morning with mom and jaron about my thoughts on genetic engineering, hybridisation, and the "origin of species"... I'll reexplain the idea and reiterate parts that had reactions to it.

after exploring the document ["et guide to creation" by kuthumi](/sirian-guide/orig/docs/840515pc.htm) of which [I wrote many notes](/sirian-guide/et-view-of-creation.md), I came to the conclusion that that version of reality might have, and possibly did, happen. however, I believe that would have been a very long time ago iteration to it. the way that creation is told has inspired in me the fallen-angels being the catalyst to creation. the basic idea is that I (I'll say it from first-person) take my entire personality and I essentially separate it into two distinct parts.. the wanted (desirable) parts about myself and the unwanted (undesirable) parts about myself. I then take my present genetics and build suitable bodies for the "gods" from those genetics -- however, I animate the "gods" with concepts with all of the unwanted aspects about myself and a number of others that I don't like... I think it would be actually quite the challenge to balance good genetics with destructive concepts and not make a disaster. these are the jefes.

the story is well-planned in the sense that the jefes will attract worstening conditons for their planet and will have to exert constant effort to keep the whole thing from falling apart. they don't want to work though, because they'd rather utilise inferior beings to do their jobs for them, so they first try and get the citizens of that planet (just normal gods, not the jefes) to do the work, but they don't want to do it, so now the technical ones will design a subordinate race. they look to the planet nearby and use the ingredients left on the planet to create the "subordinate" race of beings.

various catastrophes are attracted by the jefes own attraction, and they destroy their own world and end up having to move to the other planet (earth) where they are locked into a reincarnation cycle with only entites on the earth.

that's the et-view-of-creation in a nutshell -- and it probably happened something like that. my idea picks up from basically this point because now we have earth filled with humans which have a flexible genetic code that is responsive to their thoughts and feelings, meaning that further improvements to the genetics can be done physically, but most are done mentally and perceptually. given that capacity, we're now capable of creating any biological form which is a reflection of the person's perception -- and I think that's exactly what I did.

I postulate that I went back, probably even further back than to pre-atlantian times (to make a civilisation conceptually compatible with the fallen-angels I'll introduce into the story). that complicates the story a bit, so let's just start from the hight of atlantis and assume that the reason why the "laws" were put into place like how they were was to create an environment of wanting to do things their own way (even rai ernon looks to be in on it), and then essentially force people to do the wanted aspect, so they rebel against the wanted aspect. introduce some fallen-angels, which, considering my ideas on box-consciousness are artificially maintained entities with a strong desire to control the world and influence it from the top down.

the whole plan is to allow this hatred for the wanted aspect to be founded on a lot of bad ideas (like laws requiring one to honour, and respect all of these poorly defined concepts with no real substance to them -- just a lot of good sounding words -- "religiosity"). as an example, listen to this crap (from "unveiled mysteries" chapter 2, the king is explaining why atlantis will crash and burn):

    "Only mankind is guilty of making a discord in the music of the spheres, for all else lives and acts in accordance with the—'Law of Love, of Life, of Harmony, and of Light.' All else blends into the harmonious whole—the 'Body of the Infinite, All-Loving One.'

    "All other realms of—'Life and Light'—move and create according to the fundamental principle upon which all Perfection rests. That principle is Love. If it were not for the—'Great Selfless Ones'—like your ruler—the Great Host of Ascended Masters—whose very keynote of existence is Love—humanity would long ago have destroyed itself and the very planet upon which it exists.

    "The transcendent and magnificent activities of Love and Light are the Natural Conditions in which God created and expected His human children to manifest—obeying His command—'to Love.' There is no such thing as a supernatural condition anywhere in the universe. All that is Transcendent, Beautiful and Perfect is Natural and according to the 'Law of Love.' Anything other than that is sub-natural. The daily experience of the Host of Ascended Masters is—the Perfection—God's children were meant to live in always. Earth's children did express this Perfection once—in a former cycle, which was—'One Golden Age.'

all these awful conditions are your fault because you're not like the selfless ascended masters who are obeying God's command to love...

    "O Children of Earth, I bring you a warning of serious import, at a time of great crisis. Arouse yourselves from the snare of the senses that is engulfing you! Awake from your lethargy, before it is too late! This, my 'Brother of Light' must withdraw and leave you to the experience that you have chosen, and which is slowly enticing you into its many pitfalls. You have opened yourselves to the uncontrolled ignorance and emotions of the outer self.

    "You give little attention and still less adoration to your 'Source'—the Supreme, the Mighty, the Radiant, the Majestic, the Infinite Cause of all that is—the Creator and Sustainer of all worlds. You give no gratitude to the 'Great Glorious Presence'—the 'Lord of Love'—for the very Life by which you exist.

    "Oh! why are you not even grateful, for the blessings Nature pours out so lavishly, for the abundance that comes to you through this fair land, and from your own wise and unselfish ruler? You thank each other for favors—the things of the senses and form that are so ephemeral—that pass from one to another and then are no more—but why, Oh why! do you forget the—'Source'—of all Life, all Love, all Intelligence, all Power?

    "People! O People! where is your gratitude to Life for Love, for the magnificence of experience that you enjoy every moment, every hour, every day, year after year? All this you call your own, but it has always belonged, does now, and always will belong to the—One Great Source of Life, Light, Love and All Good—GOD—the Supreme—the Adorable—the All-Pervading One.

it goes on for a little while longer then offers no actual tangible content about how to have adoration for your source. I find its ideas to have very little relevance to the listener. this section tells us we need "love" to bring harmony. I can see that "love" here is 2nd ray, "the—Great God Flame" is desire (1) and mind, form, action, etc. are the 3rd ray...

    "Love is not an activity of the mind, but is the—'Pure and Luminous Essence'—which creates mind. This—Essence—from the—Great God Flame—streams into substance, and constantly pours itself out, as Perfection in form and action. Love is Perfection manifest. It can only express peace, joy, and an outpouring of those feelings to all creation—unconditionally. It asks—nothing—for Itself because It is—Eternally Self-Creating—being the Heartbeat—of the 'Supreme.' Love owns—All—and is only concerned with setting the Plan of Perfection into action in all. Thus, It is a constant pouring out of Itself. It takes no cognizance of what has been given in the past, but receives Its joy and maintains Its balance by the continual—Out-streaming of Itself. Because this Perfection is within Love—forever flowing forth—it is incapable of recording anything but Itself.

    "'Love' alone is the basis of harmony and the right use of all Life energy. In human experience, this grows into a desire to give, and give, and give of all the individual's peace and harmony unto the rest of creation.

    "People! O People! forever throughout the ages! only enough Love can bring you back to the Heaven you once knew and abided in. Here, you will once again embrace the fulness of the 'Great Light' that gives all through Love.

so, because nobody has "love" prepare for punishment for not having "love"...

    "A visiting prince approaches your borders. He will enter this city—seeking the daughter of your king. You will come under the rule of this prince but the recognition of your mistake will be futile. Nothing can avail, for the royal family will be drawn into the protection and care of those—whose power and authority are of God—and against whom—no human desire can ever prevail. These are the Great Ascended Masters of Light—from the Golden Etheric City—over this land. Here your ruler and his beloved children will abide for a cycle of time." Turning to the king he addressed him, saying:

    "I bless you my noble, patient Brother! Loving and selfless has been the service to your people. Deep and eternal is your devotion to the Supreme One—the Source of All Creation. The Golden Etheric City awaits and joyously welcomes you and your children.

    "Within Its radiance you shall live serving through the Rays of Light which are forever streaming out from those who dwell therein, until these your people shall redeem themselves by—obedience—to the 'Law of Love.'

    "This 'Empire of Light' exists over the land you have loved so well. It is composed of self-luminous, etheric substance and rests above the physical city which is your capital. It is Real, very Real and much more permanent than any earthly city, for—'Light'—is indestructible and the Golden City is made of—'Light.' Into It, no inharmonious thought or disturbing condition of any kind can ever enter.

    "I will return in seven days to take you and your children into the—'City of Light'—where we shall watch the progress of humanity, and draw into the—'Light'—all who will discipline and make themselves ready. Encircling the City is—an invincible belt of electronic force—through which it is impossible for anything uninvited to pass."

my goodness, while reading this, I really wonder what are the tangible conceptual things that can be gleaned from all of that. for me, there's no actual information there. instead, it's a bunch of out of reach ideals, judgment, commands, authority which talks to people like they're stupid. it's that kind of crap that is an obvious mechanism designed to make people hate all of that spirituality stuff -- and, sure enough -- the destruction of atlantis did happen just like prophesied, causing some people to try and preserve the atlantian traditions in effort to hold on to the wanted aspect -- while others not wanting to obey the command to love went the opposite direction, attempting to install dominance power structures with all of the unwanted aspects.

I think it was all planned and designed from the beginning and the evidence is that it's commanded to love and for disobedience to that command they're told a prophecy (which they believe and then create) their own distruction. from the creator of the species's perspective, the first phase is to make the wanted aspects manditory, then for the ones that inevitably rebel against those commands, they are given the equally as bad admonishment to install all of the power structures of their own and enforce all of the unwanted aspects instead. then, from there it basically follows the phases described in leapfrogging-time-pickles, and then the creators use that society to push the difficulty level for theirselves to the maximum.

from my perspective, I think it could be possible to create this whole thing with a team, but consider the idea that "I" am designing a "species" (and I use that word in plato's conceptual/ideal sense rather than the modern sense), in which I would enjoy to inhabit the species.

I take myself and I split the concept of myself into 4 shapes:
- wanted
- unwanted
- unwanted (reverse polarity)
- wanted (reverse polarity)

and then I use these four concepts to create archtypes and transformations for the species, and then I jump into the species and become it. I definitely don't want to try and micromanage the thing from the top, as that's the unwanted aspect.

the whole system is based on the ideas of "law of attraction" in that I'm only really fighting myself. so, you may say, well, what about me? am I also fighting myself? yes, because you can only experience what you resonate with. so imagine for a moment only the physical aspect to it -- like a hybrid. here you have 4 different "species" that you're going to make hybrids of, and let's say that the reason for this hybridisation is because some environmental condition has changed making it difficult for the secies to live. consider the unwanted ones to be kind of like weeds in that they're more hardy cause they're more used to surviving under difficult conditions, so you have to find a way to mix these to breed out the unwanted aspects and maintain the wanted aspects.

I put the four concepts in that way because "unwanted (reverse polarity)" looks kinda like wanted, however in a sexual reproduction context, it's more like "unwanted (opposite sex)". so, now we have our groups:

- wanted (male)
- unwanted (male)
- unwanted (female)
- wanted (female)

you'll notice that the mythologies are full of unwanted males and unwanted females. in fact, vulcan is said to have created for zeus exactly that -- an unwanted female (pandora). soloman has the paiman concept/demon, etc.

it appears to me that hybrids of these concepts have been present all over the place, so it's no special thing for me to see creation happening as a result of mixing of these concepts.

---

so, it's my estimation that this whole setup has been created artificially as a concept of my own mind. the way I have it planned is that over the next era (1024y), humankind will go through rapid increase in capacity, and there will be quite a lot of us alive at the end of that time. I'm pretty sure the guys running the show are unwanted concept variations of my own creation, and essentially reflect all of the things that I'd rather not be a part of myself.

at the end of that time, many of us will be alive and we'll gain the capacity to go back and alter our own timeline in the format described in leapfrogging-time-pickles, and we'll iterate on this timeline for a while. I can't say how many iterations will happen as I don't think there's a limit. everyone makes their own reality, so I imagine that quite a few will go back and design their own "fall".

---

wow, I went a little longer on responding to some of the reactions than I imagined -- no worries. I woke up this afternoon and had a realisation that the vision sequence that I had was the *wanted* aspect, and if I'm true to my own concept, I should actually just not worry about it because the wanted aspect will happen -- though perhaps not in that exact way.

I think it's fine to keep trying to delay.

the other thing I'd like to mention is that leapfrogging-time-pickles doesn't necessarily imply a linear progression through the timeline. as an example, in the future, I'll likely jump back into this timeline with a whole lot of others, which means that my future self is probably alive today.

in fact, the other day (03-24), I had such an experience. it happened a few times but I had these very real seeming experiences (memories?) with amber (jp's wife), and it was as if I was the kid. I don't know what to think about it, but I remember when jaron read me jp's facebook post about him going to have a boy and I said something really weird like "I'm sure jp is going to be a very good father" -- which caught me as really weird because I don't usually say things like that -- ever. I don't really know what to make of it. there was also another instance (@[noseblog](2021-07-28 16:49)) where I was writing about how I was as a kid in relation to jaxson (whom I called "ted") and he represented for me the future of children -- I remember when I was writing about how I used to cry because of the way mom felt, I had a strong sensation that what I was saying was meaningful to amber, so I wrote "sorry amber?" right there to acknowledge that. I do have a lot of strange reactions to a lot of things, so I don't really discount the experience -- rather that I don't fully understand it.

I realise that the above paragraph could be taken to mean that I think future me reincarnated into jp's kid -- which upon reflection does kind of give that impression. I mean you'll have to ask her about her ideas on that, but I wrote that originally because I had another weird experience before that (I think I was out on the field) when I had this strong sensation that amber's kid would be a girl and the idea felt good to me. the same thing happened with jessica's kid too, but it turns out that both were revealed to be boys.

I supposed that the reason for this was that those children being girls was considered undesirable, and so then an alteration to the timeline was made where someone (dunno who) went back and changed the event on the timeline so that an x3 that looked like jp or like andrew had sex instead to ensure that the output was a boy (an x3), and so therefore they would be the first non-secret examples of x3 children on the planet.

I also wrote this to give the idea that once we get to the "end of days", then we just start over, and jump into new bodies. this is going to sound weird, but it feels like many from the future have been and continue to join me in the body I have now. I personally don't mind or care, really.

also, I'm pretty sure that many others are making their own timeline the way they want to do it as well. that's totally the point of it all, as I'm sure that each iteration they'll get bigger and bigger ideas of what to create. just imagine tens to hundreds of iterations from now, how the entire "species" will all be super awesome.

the key to all of this is that unwanted also creates wanted.

---

so, in conclusion, I'll probably just let it keep going. one of the key things that I was thinking about in that vision was the idea of the birthday. you see, in "encanto", I found patricia similar to dolores in that she hears everything. it also felt this afternoon when I was thinking about the birthday bit of the connection to the name dolores (many pains), because it may have happened that she suffered "many pains" in self-flagellation and that in some ways, that could "make it up" or something like that (not exactly that feeling), to kind of undo the previous suffering. I mean I don't think that she went through *that* much suffering -- but it was an idea on my mind so it's worth noticing, even if it later doesn't amount to anything.

I said all of that because I wanted to remove the time constraint. the other idea that popped into my mind is that I have this suspicion that some sort of changes place when girls interact with me. I don't have data to say for sure what kind of changes a girl goes through when sexually interacting with a guy, but I had this weird image of transfiguration appear in my mind -- OK, so lemme back up. the original concept was the idea that *if* I were made king, I would pass it on to someone else, preferrably a girl. well, I'm not a king, and know of no efforts to make me one -- nor do I have the requisite security clearance to be a king, either -- so for me it was a hypothetical situation.

anyway that image of "transfiguration" was the opposite: patricia transfigured, and it felt as if it were because of the discomfort (described previously as "many pains") being realised in the opposite direction of perspective -- and that caused her to glow and levitate and become radiant and beautiful.

the idea that this should happen on her birthday was that she'll be turning 37, so she'll have completed her 36th year. well, vere writes about the number 36 in job 41. [I made some notes](/random-notes/job-41.md), and she, like the leviathan will be the king of the proud children and has the number 36, which I estimate is also the same as the 666 triangle number which is the sum 1...36.

anyway that sounds a bit like trying too hard to me, so why not just let that whole thing fall through and just let all of the normal LOA stuff work out something better than that?

I really had a strong sense that timeline was already created, and that's actually how we got to this one. this one is even "worse" than this one -- a disaster of much more epic proportions. it's hard to explain the feeling, but the basic sense is that I felt very at ease to everything. so, for example -- if the whole stress to try and get me entangled with a bunch of girls to ensure that I don't go around in a connected state feels to be a large fear, and that fear was gone. I don't know what it was that made that no longer a fear, but it didn't exist. also the fear that I had to constantly be weary of my computer and these documents also seemed to disappear too. it felt like I was on an unavoidable course toward wanted and couldn't really miss it if I tried, and so therefore there's nothing to worry about.

there are a number of reactions right now to the contrary with even bigger fears, but I just don't think it's a problem. I think it's fine to just keep going, actually. we'll see how things go.

anyway, I'm really enjoying this process of learning and writing more. I can imagine a potential situation where I keep discovering more and more than I am now, and it becomes undesirable to let me continue to write -- as in, they need me doing other things. gravity anomalies... lol

### 2022-03-25 ??:?? - last night's vision experienc
