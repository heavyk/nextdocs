# bob's blah blog

I'm gonna try a new thing where I type out some things that I normally wouldn't type out -- mostly because they involve other people and I don't really want to put them too much on the spot. what I mean is, I don't have any problem with my life being public, but I definitely occlude the identity of various people and related ideas in noseblog/newblog.

I don't recommend you take anything I say elsewhere too seriously, but even less so here. I'm just going to dump out ideas talk random things through.

well, here goes...

I labeled it with bob because I had an idea after listening to a snake-bro's episode, when russ mentioned "pickle rick", I thought about writing out some of the more funny cucumber stories. I haven't done so, because its a bit unnecessary, but if I have something like larry's "picklepick", I can have bob and larry (plant heros -- and, making me "el seed") supple-mental goofing around zones to play in too. the thing is, I want to write more things down, but I feel like if I write them in newblog, they get taken too seriously and sometimes I don't feel inspired to write anything in particular, so I just want to just drool mentally like a newborn, lost in my own world (it's hard to explain). I mainly just want to listen to music and write about less-serious things.

### 2022-04-04 04:23 - triads in encanto

one of the things I noticed in "encato" is that the triads are two females and one male. there may be others but the ones that stand out to me are in the very beginning it shows the original 3 children the abuela has (seen best at 02:35). it may be the case that more of their identity was revealed, but I the movie is really fast-paced and my brain is slow to absorb so much visual information.

however, later on there is a triad of generations. I believe that bruno, mirabel, and the abuela

```
       augustin
       julieta (healer)
abuela /
  +   ---- bruno (time)
pedro  \
        pepa (tormenta)
        felix

pepa (seed) & felix (lucky/successful):
- dolores (hears everything) (many pains)
- camilo (shapeshifter) (helper to the priest)
- antonio (beastmaster) (flourishing)

julieta (youthful, love's child) & augustin (great/magnificent):
- luisa (strong) (renowned warrior)
- isabela (graceful, pretty & perfect) (God's promise/oath)
- mirabel (male & female name meaning wondrous beauty)
```

in the very beginning it's revealed that the family madrigal is a *constellation* of brightly shining stars. except for bruno (brown dwarf??), the entire family is females that acquires normal men to produce more gifted children. mirabel sings about how she wants to shine (have brightness) like the rest of them

- bruno's vision causes disruption in beliefs (doubts).
- when mirabel saw the cracks, luisa became weak
  - therefore, mirabel is somewhere between abuela and bruno
  - mirabel is the "ground"


mirabel kinda represents a combination of all of the family's gifts, but undeveloped or still inside of her:
- mirabel's dress has flowers on it
- mirabel has the combination of qualities from her mother and two sisters.
  - in her opening song she says that if she had a miracle, she would:
    - move mountains (luisa)
    - make new trees and flowers grow (isabela)
    - heal what's broken (julieta)
    - show this family something new -- something inside her (no one)
- the tucan that tells antonio to bring everyone inside of his room, is also there to show mirabel the way through bruno's time den, and she follows it

- there's an entire song saying that everything that bruno says comes to pass.
- when pepa was about to get married to felix, on wedding day, bruno thinks it's a funny joke to tell pepa that it looks like it's going to rain and she causes it to rain on her own wedding day
  - meaning, that bruno is a known trickster that is known to cause someone to sabotage their own good conditions by putting a prophecy or ideas into the person's head.

bruno tells:
- isabela that
  - the *light* of my dreams would be promised and someday would be mine
  - her power would grow like the grapes on the vine
- dolores that
  - the man of her dreams would be just out of reach (betrothed to another)

dolores overhears mirabel tell augustin that the magic of the house is fading and antonio says "miercoles" (day of mercury) and then mirabel says, "she's going to tell everyone" (mercury is the messenger god)

- bruno means brown (and everyone believes him)
- julieta & autustin
  - sound a lot to me like july and august -- very roman empire
  - very white
  - augustin, meaning great and magnificent, is nothing of the sorts; he has alergies and no gift (tells mirabel that it was intimidating at first)
- pepa & felix
  - felix is easy going (lucky) but clearly dark-skinned
  - pepa is very moody and white
  - all their children are brown (bruno)

the three little kids that are asking mirabel what her gift is:
- light-brown kid with coffee
- black girl
- white girl

I get the impression that the white people are always concerned and moody, but the (adult) brown ones seem to be much more chill
- the beastmaster kid, who, before he gets mirabel's stuffed animal and mirabel takes him to get his beastmaster gift, was very nervous and shy.
- felix (in good cheer) was willing to reveal why people don't talk about bruno, while pepa was not willing and stormy.
- dolores went to tell people the secret that augustin was going to enforce that nobody should say

there's this whole wierd part when mariano is going to propose that mirabel is trying to keep the secret, but dolores is insistant on telling everyone.

this whole secret thing in the movie strikes me as weird because dolores hears everything, so it seems like she would have previously been quite the snitch telling everyone's secrets to everyone else. I wonder why she is so intent on telling this one? what makes mirabel having recovered bruno's vision something she wants to share so badly?

the beasts also seem very very interested in reassembling the vision in its entirety, meanwhile everyone else is trying to keep a secret.

---

so, I'm still processing all of the symbols there. all of that was mainly just to keep processing it more. what I was thinking about mainly was the two females one male triads.

what started it all was when I was writing @[newblog](2022-04-02 03:55), I was trying to figure out who unessa was.

to give a background to this problem, in the sirian-guide, there is a very puzzling thing that I didn't understand, which was it always said that unessa is venus. there are two problems with it:

first, I'm pretty sure they're referring to the planet venus, and *not* the goddess because they say, "Isis was loved, Unessa was admired, Genxicat was desired and Anatau was feared." (not sure if it's relevant but they also say that vulcan was amired), so genxicat was the desired one, which is clearly the goddess of desire and love labeled in the mythologies as venus. well, the problem with "her" being a planet is that I get the sense that have planets as masculine entities, even though they call planets "collectors of solar energy"

second, the other problem is that they say that unessa loved mars (allayandra), a smooth-talking 7th ray male warrior:

> Allayandra loved Venus; these stories are still around in the form of Mars and Venus.

> Dwul Quinn is Unessa's grounding agent which added to Quinn's more than somber nature and also accounts for the legends of the beautiful Venus being married to the ugliest god.

well, the mythologies talk about *vulcan* being married to aphrodite, and that he was quite a hideous blacksmith with probably club feet and a limp. aphrodite was the one that is said to have slept with mars.

vulcan is paired with genxicat (aphrodite), which checks out, but genxicat isn't venus -- unessa is venus (which is the one that loved mars)... so, is unessa the same as genxicat?

to further complicate the matter, there is a polarity swap between  saturn (+-4) and vulcan (-5+). for males, they input their opposite ray and output their opposite, so 2/6, 3/5 or 1/7. however females input their same ray type that they output, which leads me to believe that females' polarity swap is 3/7, 4/?, 2/6, 1/5.

so that's the problem... I haven't figured it out yet, but this movie got me thinking about it a lot because isabela is most like genxicat. she struggles with being "perfect" and has this realisation and breakthrough with mirabel that she doesn't have to be perfect -- she can be messy and crate asymmetrical, prickly things. genxicat, always being the image of men's desire had an identity crisis (who is she, if she's not the "perfect" image?)

so, that makes unessa dolores. there's a weird thing where bruno tells dolores that the man of her dreams will always be out of her reach and betrothed to someone else. isabela doesn't really want to be with mariano. mariano comes from the latin name for mars, and also sounds of a concatenation of "mar" (ocean) and "iano" (possesor of). it sounds a lot like the name, maria... which in my best estimation is "mar" + "the maker of" -- the maker of the sea. so mariano is posesser of the ocean (neptuno?). the internet says marius is latin for mars, but if I remember right, "us" is the genetive case, meaning possessor of the ocean. so, I dunno there..

---

anyway, when thinking about dolores being unessa, I had this crazy realisation that mirrors a lot of reactions that I get all the time in regard to patricia. I don't know her position in nosebook, but I would imagine that she probably "hears everything" and has lots of statistics on it too (I had always associated patricia with unessa).

so then later when I was in the bathroom, I was sitting there and I had this "vision" sequence (call me bruno here) of this thing (this isn't the first time it happened -- see next entry) where I started to think about her in the context of these two female one male triads.

the sirian triads (MFM) have two input/output types: the female and the ground, so I would expect a FMF triad to have something similar as well. because I dont have data to say one way or another what the female polarity swap would be, I figured that I almost certainly can play one of those transceivers. it reminded me of my speculation on the vulcan/genxicat and the virtual 5th ray triad.

I noted that vulcan has a polarity change and he is (-5+), meaning that he essentially behaves like a female in that he is primarily receptive. I also noted that they mentioned a first ray male of allayandra (mars) combining with anatau to form a first ray male (meaning input 7, output 1).

- genxicat (-7)
- vulcan (-5+)
- allayandra + anatau (+1)

that makes genxicat the emitter, which if my polarity ideas are correct, then she'll input 7 output 3. there's also a thing about the initiation where the monad communicates directly, releasing the solar angel (something like that). I already believe myself to be at least 2 inhabiting the same bodies -- and quite likely a female too.

so, let's just say that what if one of those personalities is allayandra and one is anatau, then I would behave as a first ray would. this doesn't seem at all out of the realm of possibilities for me, as I most definitely identify most with either a 1st ray male or a 5th ray male.

remember the dragon in rev 12 with 7 heads and the sirian's admonition that they are intending to work on "all at once". they make very clear that you have vehicles on all of these planes of perception, yet are not aware of most of them. so, the goal is to be able to transmit and receive on all 7 (that's 14 capacities). I believe that, like the dragon in rev 12, will have 7 sets of eyes in 7 different worlds.

as such, it's my continued goal to find ways to find more and more ways to transmit and receive on all of these planes simultaneously. when this happens, the "first ray life wave" will happen -- which is basically sirian speak for initiation of a new cell, person, planet, star, galaxy, universe, etc. any time you have the "serpent biting its tail" that is the first ray life wave.

they say that the 1st ray has all of the active intelligence of the 2nd and 3rd ray, and that the 6th is a reflection of the 2nd, and the 4,5,7th are reflections of the 3rd -- therefore a first ray life wave is just a 7-headed dragon -- the serpent biting its own tail -- the 7th and the 1st together (kinda like allayandra and anatau).

I said all of that because I wanted to basically make the case for the idea that I'm working on all phases of perteption. the secondary iplication here is that it enables a whole lot of other triads that were never possible in their "pure ray energy" triad relationships.

---

the final piece to this puzzle (for me), is to imagine vulcan in the form of a female (the opposite of unessa). the thing I don't understand is the polarity swap. if my polarity sway idea above is correct, opposite polarity vulcan is genxicat. however, if I'm wrong about that, then opposite polarity vulcan is venus/unessa.

going back to the mythologies, vulcan is said to have emerged from hera -- which is the opposite polarity of jupiter. in my estimation, jupiter is most certainly a 7th ray male, "A SEVENTH RAY does enjoy playing around creating illusions within the framework of a sexual relationship but this can become a problem for them for as with everything with a SEVENTH RAY, they may confuse the real and the illusion" which is (IMO), a very accurate description of zeus/jupiter.

another strange thing in the mythologies is the strange connection between athena and vulcan. it's unclear who was jealous of the other creating the other, but it seems that athena is the polarity swap of zeus and vulcan the polarity swap of hera. hera is also said to shapshift and was also very beautiful. I would say that hera is 7th ray female. I have no idea where to put athena being a goddess of wisdom something similar to the female verson of solomon.

it all gets very confusing for me to think about all of this stuff. as such, I prefer to think instead about the possibilites of creating my own reality.

---

anyway, the vision sequence involved me and patricia as the trancievers and then a whole bunch of 7th ray female emitters. the impordtant part of the vision is that I passed off to patricia the position of "king" (ie. polarity swap). the other thing the vision did was reveal a potential solution to previous thoughts I had in @[newblog](2022-04-02 00:43), where I figure that there needs to be an interface where people can put their desires and vote for them. at some critial mass, the desire gets implemented. that makes the people the desire -- so we then need a bunch of 7th rays. supposedly the 7th ray is coming into power, so there should be no shortage of them. like the 1st ray, the 7th ray has all of the active intelligece of the 6th and the 5th, but it'll choose to neglect one or the other favouring something that aligns with the physical better. since the 6th aligns much better with the physical, I imagine most 7th ray perceivers neglect their conceptual (5) side the most -- hence my trying to figure out a 5th ray triad.

most of the stuff I write in these are 5th ray concepts (and 5th ray more closely aligns to 1st and 2nd than to 7th), so if there has ever been a good salesperson for 5th ray perception, it's me. undoubtedly some actually see it as useful at this point.

OK, that's enough for now. I really can't believe how inspiring the encanto movie has been for me; it's really cool, and I really like the animation and charactor design.

P.S. I didn't even share my ideas on the triad of abuela, bruno and mirabel, lol. next time...

### 2022-04-04 11:39 - continuing...

I left off last time with the part on the triad of the abuela, bruno and mirabel. they appear to me to be a 1st ray triad. however, it could be a 2nd ray triad too. what I mean by that is that abuela clearly is 2nd ray, though she's much less isis and more jeortau.

there are serious flaws in both of these appearances. she's more jeortau in her belief that she has to preserve the miracle for everyone ("I was given a miracle -- a second chance, and I was so afraid to lose it") -- and another thing about sacrificing and saving which I can't remember where it is now. she's not very charismatic either like jerotau is said to have been.

so in considering the other case where she's more like isis, again she doesn't fit entirely because isis doesn't feel to me like the type of person that would try and hide something that's falling apart and try to enforce it with secrets and appearance -- though I could be wrong on that; I wasn't there.

the way that I see it, a 2nd ray is really good at seeing connections between things, good or bad, and 3rd rays seem to take things more from a sequential perspective. in this sense bruno fits perfectly -- where he's using people's past reactions to predict his own future, whereas a 2nd ray is much more enthusiastic about making connections to save something, solve a problem, or bring a apparently ideal relationship together.

I suupose it's possible that a 2nd ray that feels everything is not good enough could go out of their way to try and hide things that are not good enough or fall short of their expectations. even luisa complains that no matter how heavy things get and pressure, there's continued measurement and expectations which feel impossible to fulfil... I'm just going to conclude that it's a 1st ray triad with mirabel as anatau, abuela as jeortau, and bruno as sanatau.

---

so the reason why I said it that way is that makes abuela the emitter (she runs the show afterall), and the others the supporting roles. now, if we just look at the generations, abuela produced bruno which is essentially the transition (opposite polarity) between abuela and mirabel. you can see that mirabel at the beginning of the movie adheres to a lot of abuela's same behaviours (abuela neither has a gift), and so therefore is essentially an exact replica.

OK, now going back to patricia: in that other setup she would be abuela, I would be bruno and maribel would be the other various emitters. in reality, both patricia and the other girls are both emitters, so this creates a bit of a problem for me.

the reason why I haven't wanted to get involved with this stuff until I'm fully connected is because I know that even in a fully connected state, I'll still be quite affected by all the different girls and all of their varying forms of perception. you see, I really like my form of perception, and I'm not really all that interested in other people's forms of perception, no matter how pretty or attractive they are. a lot of different girls would essentially make me go all over the place. even the tiny amount that I've been around girls (maybe only at becky's house), I found it miserable because there are so many misconceptions that I just don't care. I don't want to sit there and mansplain everything I think that they're thinking. the quantity of "not good enoughness" that I felt just in that short period of time was overwhelming to me. I just didn't feel good about anything.

it seemed to me the way that sarah was presenting it, the teen years would only make that not good enoughness worse to the effect of actually believing that you're actually inconsequential -- and so therefore, you have to join a club of cool people in order to feel substantial.

I have a note to write an entry in newblog called, "family dynamics (individuality & charisma)" -- and I wish I had of done so, cause for anyone listening in, this part will make a lot more sense: when looking at all interactions from a 3rd ray (A+B+C, then D is coming next) all interactions are perceived in the form of symbols or archetypes (or, if you're a statistician, groupings)... the problem with looking at yourself as interacting with your world in reference to a statistic or a norm, means that you need something to set you apart from the rest in order to have any charisma. generally speaking, from that point of view, if you're 50 percentile or lower (pick your metric) then, you're "not good enough" -- and if you believe otherwise "you have your head in the clouds" or "you need to get a grip on reality" -- that you're a no-impact cog in the machine.

to aviod this no-impact cog in the machine dissonance, you have to join an association that is someting -- whether it's a futbol team, football team, basketball team, stonecutters, masons, businsess lounge -- whatever, and if they're winning, then you can finally accept that you could also be like the others in the association -- winning.

---

so as I was contemplating this idea about patricia, I noticed two things: first, there was a reaction that she didn't really want to be involved in relationships. almost certainly she sees them from the "aerial view" and knows how much of a sham the entire relationship debacle is -- probably lots of statistics to back up her suppositions as well. if I were in her position, I would definitely have done my research just the same. I came to the conclusion that relationships are larely a lot of low-self-esteem people trying to leverage someone else to justify their feeling better about theirselves. IMO, yuck. no thank you -- so, that makes two of us.

the second reaction that I had was one of comparison to others in probably body shape, appearance, etc. cause it felt quite a bit like "not good enough"

---

if that setup were to go through, I think what would happen is that I would become the female, and she would be the ground: I would be allayandra+anatau and she would be vulcan.

you can probably see the problems with that right off.

so, what I'm trying to do is to figure out how to do the abuela, bruno, mirabel setup. it would be just as it sounds, and I would be bouncing between a lot of confused perspectives of "not good enough", essentially puting all of the responsibility on me, and I'm sorta like bruno in that I'd rather just hide out behind the kitchen and let them create their own reaities. when it all falls apart, mirabel will finally seek me out (I suppose).

I suppose that another way to look at it is a two-way transmission where patricia is passing her implementation desires (she's vulcan the master craftsman now -- and this is in reference to constructing solutions to those voted desires) down to the girls to ultimately do a lot of the work, and I'm passing the girls perspective of "good enough" (hopefully) back up to her.

at the moment, it sounds kinda shakey to me.

---

there's a reaction, "wow, kenny even more candid" -- kinda a feeling of disbelief... lol yeah, I guess.. jaja

### 2022-04-04 18:07 - not-good-enoughness

I was laying there thinking about not-good-enoughness and I decided that I want to start getting into the habit of thinking out loud in here.

the first recognition was that tesla had a lot of not-good-enoughness going. he did kind of mention it in a few places in regards to why he hasn't married, but, in a lot of cases, he was so far ahead of so many people perceptually, it's difficult to relate to them.

I understand this quite well, as I find my perspective to be so different, I often saw myself as ahead or something like that (not really superior -- just they didn't really match my quality standards). this changed a lot when I got to spain as I had to actually hire and interact with people (alcohol helps a lot too).

for most of the time I was in spain, I would compare myself to other dudes who were "picking up chicks" and notice how not-good-enough they were -- and really, most of the guys out there are complete boneheads.

but, like I said -- it's counter-intuitive, but if I'm out there pointing the finger at all these other guys and saying, "wow he's definitiely not good enough for her" -- the thing is I'm only noticing my own not-good-enoughness in other people.

what I'm saying is that "quality standards" were actually inhibiting me -- and I know this to be true because as I stopped noticing how not-good-enough other people were, the more people started to think I was good enough.

when I stopped noticing how not-good-enough all people are, I also stopped noticing my own not-good-enoughness. I never said, "I'm not good enough for her (or whatever)" cause I'm too proud for that. instead, I would just notice how much better I am than they are.

so, what I'm saying is I stopped noticing how much better I am to other people -- meaning, I no longer felt the need to compare myself to other people to feel good about myself.

---

in summary, my own not-good-enoughness came about because I was watching a lot of people in the discos, bars and such and noticing a lot of really not-good-enoughness in other people. that lead me to live a life of comparisons and, I bolstered my self-esteem by comparing myself to and noticing those others that never could measure up using my quality standards.

as I stopped caring about others not-good-enoughness, they just became other people and I stopped caring about how well they measured up to my quality standards. just the same as in "effortless power", the process of stripping the gun of all of it's physicality, leaving just an inert concept behind -- people just became concepts of their own creation which interact with each other in predictable ways (ie what they're attracting)... and who cares what they're doing anyway.

so, by stripping all of these concepts of their physicality[^1], they became pure illuminated orbs of brilliancy to me. just like when meditating, you stop thinking (physical) thoughts -- well, this is the conceptual version of that. take the physicality away from the concept so that it can be perceived, no matter the circumstances for its brilliancy underneith all of that physical crap on the exterior. as you do this for others, you do this for yourself and you, yourself become brilliant and radiant like a star.

---

this process of removing the physicality from the concept is kind of the antithesis to romance (latin, spanish, etc.) interactions. the reason why all of these songs and movies, telenovelas, etc. emit such a powerful emotion is because they have in them so much physicality wrapped up in the interactions. for example, in encanto, if the abuela hadn't have got so angry with mirabel for ruining the miracle, the movie wouldn't have been nearly as emotionally impactful. though, it's just a normal response when someone feels responsible for something falling apart and they feel helpless to save it.

I try to understand these interactions so that I don't have a strong emotional reaction to them anymore. I learned that a strong emotional reactions create tremendous friction which are usually a waste of energy, but if one knows how to manipulate the concept perceptually, one can take all of that strong negative emotion and turn it into pure euphoria. I attempt to do this, and I even write (on purpose) reaction pieces, because I know that wanted-and-unwanted-are-same. I plow forward heading straight for disaster knowing that it's all a perceived disaster from one angle and from another it's wanted. so why not, like the latin romance crap (novelas, shows, etc.) pump up the not-good-enoughness?

small confession: do a brief look back and notice how much the not-good-enoughness angle has come up; it's quite significant, and I would venture a guess that most of the people following this *also* resonate with not-good-enoughness. I used to really have this *a lot*, and it's only been somewhat recently when I've gotten really serious about stripping the concept from its physicality.

I've never worried too much about all of the reactions to not-good-enoughness though because it's all perceptual and that mainly means that my auience mostly has high quality standards as well. there's nothing wrong with high quality standards -- it's just when they're put in comparison. a desire isn't a comparison. a desire is a desire, and my desire doesn't need to involve anyone else. it's just something that will happen naturally when my reality reflects it.

that means that the quality standards are just a distraction from what's really important which is my perception. as an example, try to sustain a feeling of bliss without meditating. if you can, then that means that you aren't thinking any thoughts in opposition to that bliss. the bliss is always there -- just the other crap makes the bliss hard to feel. likewise, the high quality stuff is always there, just the idea that you want to stay away from the low quality stuff keeps the low quality stuff in view.

look at it in the negative now: we're programmed (mostly by the television -- hello cnn/fox news, aida, muchachada nui, etc.) how to react to things, and we just repeat the reactions like the actors do. is that really how you want to react, or would you rather understand what attracted the interaction and therefore the reaction?

the reaction is the objective, for both hollywood and for LOA. if you want to react a certain way because you like how it feels, then you're seeking (attracting) the action to give you the reaction.

I used to try and explain to people in the bars that the television (most notably the news) is just a reaction programming service. I don't remember when exactly I gave up (probably in augusto's bar), but by the time trump got into office I had completely given up on trying to explain this concept, deciding to instead pick my reaction type. so, starting with colbert and meyers I decided to just laugh at it all. people reacted to me laughing at trump, which at that time, most people in spain thought that spelled the end of USA being taken seriously. they were kinda right, and they hated me laughing so hard at it all falling apart (which is probably also a programmed reaction).

anyway, the programming is everywhere and once you strip away the physicality from the concept, not only do you get effortless power and very fast manifestations, but you notice that the entire planet is just a bunch of barely conscious automatons reacting the way they're taught to react.

for example (song I'm listening to):

> do you want to stay? can't erase the pain; stay away ... stay away

lol

---

last thing, notice how I felt dissatisfaction to commit on such a profound note (about stripping away the physical from the concept to allow the brilliance to be seen)? well, it was too profound, so I returned back to write that reaction piece at the end. I just can't help it. it's what people want. they like to react to things. I've tried to hold profound conversations for extended periods of time and people can't handle it. I have to throw in some "shock jock" stuff to keep people distracted from what I'm really saying. I talk mostly for my own sake, so it's fun when I can get an audience and hold their attention for a while (for reals, sometimes I really have strong 2nd ray qualities)

very last thing: I'm noticing that this blog is going in the direction of being even more hyperbolic than the previous ones. I'm going to write almost anything that comes to mind -- so, the extremes will be far more: more profund *AND* more reactionary.

I think it's fun so don't take it too seriously :)

### 2022-04-06 21:52 - not sure (rename)

the last few days I've been going over that one idea with patricia that I put a few entries back. some hours(?) after I wrote it, I had the idea, "I should just send her an email" (cause I know her email by memory). every time I thought about it, I got a pretty negative reaction from mr. motor on it, and then today because I kept thinking about it, his reaction got even more detailed. it feels like she has some high level security clearance, and I'm kinda like the opposite of security -- so it creates a bit of a problem.

yesterday, the plan I was concocting in my head -- and it's hard to say where exactly the idea was coming from but I went with it anyway -- was to just email her and say something simple, then if she wanted to reply to me that's cool. then, if we should meet, I suppose I didn't really know what would happen -- but, as I mentioned in a previous entry, I'm sticking to the derek plan, so I would just hang out with her and stuff. I imagined that we could talk about quite a lot of things -- though, I'm not so sure about that now. I'm fairly certain that I'll do most of the talking and she probably wouldn't be able to say a whole lot -- sorta like how it was when I was with chris in LA.

in combination with other things like that dream I had with nassim, I would imagine that through some way or another, I'll make it out to california -- and like I don't know how necessary it is to be in a single location for her either so it's possible she may end up there as well. I clearly don't know...

anyway, the "vision" (it's not visual) sequence played out something like going to california and working with derek and nassim, and probably a few others on ... stuff, I suppose.

there was another element to it which a long time ago I said that if anyone wanted some sort of performance out of me, then I simply had to practise for it because there's no way that I'm ever good at anything the first few many tries. so then, in california, I would practise with the other girls for a while, and then later on, maybe it could be her birthday or something, eventually, I'll be ready to go with patricia.

there were other elements to the sequence but I simply can't remember them now. those are the essential parts though.

yesterday, I wrote [a bunch of crazy ideas down](/random-notes/1024y-offset) and then went to bed. I can only imagine how my thoughts on time slicing, the paper's acknowledgement that there are *gravity anomalies* around the planet and an erratic polar position (ie. precession isn't happening as expected). I chalk all of these things up as support for my hair-brained idea that we're 1000/1024y earlier in time than we thought -- but for someone involved in that stuff you can imagine how paradigm shattering it is to have *gravity anomalies*. this is a pretty big problem and it looks like the top guys in the US military know and are likely covering up a lot of "unexpected" and "baffling" results.

almost certainly this really did a lot to strengthen their fears of me interacting with someone with security clearance... I say that because I woke up this afternoon thinking about how I think that whole vision sequence is a really great idea, but I think I'd rather just go for ultimate disaster. let me see if I can explain it.

to understand this next part, I have to involve the conversation I had this morning with mom and jaron about my thoughts on genetic engineering, hybridisation, and the "origin of species"... I'll reexplain the idea and reiterate parts that had reactions to it.

---

after exploring the document ["et guide to creation" by kuthumi](/sirian-guide/orig/docs/840515pc.htm) of which [I wrote many notes](/sirian-guide/et-view-of-creation.md), I came to the conclusion that that version of reality might have, and possibly did, happen. however, I believe that would have been a very long time ago iteration to it. the way that creation is told has inspired in me the fallen-angels being the catalyst to creation. the basic idea is that I (I'll say it from first-person) take my entire personality and I essentially separate it into two distinct parts.. the wanted (desirable) parts about myself and the unwanted (undesirable) parts about myself. I then take my present genetics and build suitable bodies for the "gods" from those genetics -- however, I animate the "gods" with concepts with all of the unwanted aspects about myself and a number of others that I don't like... I think it would be actually quite the challenge to balance good genetics with destructive concepts and not make a disaster. these are the jefes.

the story is well-planned in the sense that the jefes will attract worstening conditons for their planet and will have to exert constant effort to keep the whole thing from falling apart. they don't want to work though, because they'd rather utilise inferior beings to do their jobs for them, so they first try and get the citizens of that planet (just normal gods, not the jefes) to do the work, but they don't want to do it, so now the technical ones will design a subordinate race. they look to the planet nearby and use the ingredients left on the planet to create the "subordinate" race of beings.

various catastrophes are attracted by the jefes own attraction, and they destroy their own world and end up having to move to the other planet (earth) where they are locked into a reincarnation cycle with only entites on the earth.

that's the et-view-of-creation in a nutshell -- and it probably happened something like that. my idea picks up from basically this point because now we have earth filled with humans which have a flexible genetic code that is responsive to their thoughts and feelings, meaning that further improvements to the genetics can be done physically, but most are done mentally and perceptually. given that capacity, we're now capable of creating any biological form which is a reflection of the person's perception -- and I think that's exactly what I did.

I postulate that I went back, probably even further back than to pre-atlantian times (to make a civilisation conceptually compatible with the fallen-angels I'll introduce into the story). that complicates the story a bit, so let's just start from the hight of atlantis and assume that the reason why the "laws" were put into place like how they were was to create an environment of wanting to do things their own way (even rai ernon looks to be in on it), and then essentially force people to do the wanted aspect, so they rebel against the wanted aspect. introduce some fallen-angels, which, considering my ideas on box-consciousness are artificially maintained entities with a strong desire to control the world and influence it from the top down.

the whole plan is to allow this hatred for the wanted aspect to be founded on a lot of bad ideas (like laws requiring one to honour, and respect all of these poorly defined concepts with no real substance to them -- just a lot of good sounding words -- "religiosity"). as an example, listen to this crap (from "unveiled mysteries" chapter 2, the king is explaining why atlantis will crash and burn):

    "Only mankind is guilty of making a discord in the music of the spheres, for all else lives and acts in accordance with the—'Law of Love, of Life, of Harmony, and of Light.' All else blends into the harmonious whole—the 'Body of the Infinite, All-Loving One.'

    "All other realms of—'Life and Light'—move and create according to the fundamental principle upon which all Perfection rests. That principle is Love. If it were not for the—'Great Selfless Ones'—like your ruler—the Great Host of Ascended Masters—whose very keynote of existence is Love—humanity would long ago have destroyed itself and the very planet upon which it exists.

    "The transcendent and magnificent activities of Love and Light are the Natural Conditions in which God created and expected His human children to manifest—obeying His command—'to Love.' There is no such thing as a supernatural condition anywhere in the universe. All that is Transcendent, Beautiful and Perfect is Natural and according to the 'Law of Love.' Anything other than that is sub-natural. The daily experience of the Host of Ascended Masters is—the Perfection—God's children were meant to live in always. Earth's children did express this Perfection once—in a former cycle, which was—'One Golden Age.'

all these awful conditions are your fault because you're not like the selfless ascended masters who are obeying God's command to love...

    "O Children of Earth, I bring you a warning of serious import, at a time of great crisis. Arouse yourselves from the snare of the senses that is engulfing you! Awake from your lethargy, before it is too late! This, my 'Brother of Light' must withdraw and leave you to the experience that you have chosen, and which is slowly enticing you into its many pitfalls. You have opened yourselves to the uncontrolled ignorance and emotions of the outer self.

    "You give little attention and still less adoration to your 'Source'—the Supreme, the Mighty, the Radiant, the Majestic, the Infinite Cause of all that is—the Creator and Sustainer of all worlds. You give no gratitude to the 'Great Glorious Presence'—the 'Lord of Love'—for the very Life by which you exist.

    "Oh! why are you not even grateful, for the blessings Nature pours out so lavishly, for the abundance that comes to you through this fair land, and from your own wise and unselfish ruler? You thank each other for favors—the things of the senses and form that are so ephemeral—that pass from one to another and then are no more—but why, Oh why! do you forget the—'Source'—of all Life, all Love, all Intelligence, all Power?

    "People! O People! where is your gratitude to Life for Love, for the magnificence of experience that you enjoy every moment, every hour, every day, year after year? All this you call your own, but it has always belonged, does now, and always will belong to the—One Great Source of Life, Light, Love and All Good—GOD—the Supreme—the Adorable—the All-Pervading One.

it goes on for a little while longer then offers no actual tangible content about how to have adoration for your source. I find its ideas to have very little relevance to the listener. this section tells us we need "love" to bring harmony. I can see that "love" here is 2nd ray, "the—Great God Flame" is desire (1) and mind, form, action, etc. are the 3rd ray...

    "Love is not an activity of the mind, but is the—'Pure and Luminous Essence'—which creates mind. This—Essence—from the—Great God Flame—streams into substance, and constantly pours itself out, as Perfection in form and action. Love is Perfection manifest. It can only express peace, joy, and an outpouring of those feelings to all creation—unconditionally. It asks—nothing—for Itself because It is—Eternally Self-Creating—being the Heartbeat—of the 'Supreme.' Love owns—All—and is only concerned with setting the Plan of Perfection into action in all. Thus, It is a constant pouring out of Itself. It takes no cognizance of what has been given in the past, but receives Its joy and maintains Its balance by the continual—Out-streaming of Itself. Because this Perfection is within Love—forever flowing forth—it is incapable of recording anything but Itself.

    "'Love' alone is the basis of harmony and the right use of all Life energy. In human experience, this grows into a desire to give, and give, and give of all the individual's peace and harmony unto the rest of creation.

    "People! O People! forever throughout the ages! only enough Love can bring you back to the Heaven you once knew and abided in. Here, you will once again embrace the fulness of the 'Great Light' that gives all through Love.

so, because nobody has "love" prepare for punishment for not having "love"...

    "A visiting prince approaches your borders. He will enter this city—seeking the daughter of your king. You will come under the rule of this prince but the recognition of your mistake will be futile. Nothing can avail, for the royal family will be drawn into the protection and care of those—whose power and authority are of God—and against whom—no human desire can ever prevail. These are the Great Ascended Masters of Light—from the Golden Etheric City—over this land. Here your ruler and his beloved children will abide for a cycle of time." Turning to the king he addressed him, saying:

    "I bless you my noble, patient Brother! Loving and selfless has been the service to your people. Deep and eternal is your devotion to the Supreme One—the Source of All Creation. The Golden Etheric City awaits and joyously welcomes you and your children.

    "Within Its radiance you shall live serving through the Rays of Light which are forever streaming out from those who dwell therein, until these your people shall redeem themselves by—obedience—to the 'Law of Love.'

    "This 'Empire of Light' exists over the land you have loved so well. It is composed of self-luminous, etheric substance and rests above the physical city which is your capital. It is Real, very Real and much more permanent than any earthly city, for—'Light'—is indestructible and the Golden City is made of—'Light.' Into It, no inharmonious thought or disturbing condition of any kind can ever enter.

    "I will return in seven days to take you and your children into the—'City of Light'—where we shall watch the progress of humanity, and draw into the—'Light'—all who will discipline and make themselves ready. Encircling the City is—an invincible belt of electronic force—through which it is impossible for anything uninvited to pass."

my goodness, while reading this, I really wonder what are the tangible conceptual things that can be gleaned from all of that. for me, there's no actual information there. instead, it's a bunch of out of reach ideals, judgment, commands, authority which talks to people like they're stupid. it's that kind of crap that is an obvious mechanism designed to make people hate all of that spirituality stuff -- and, sure enough -- the destruction of atlantis did happen just like prophesied, causing some people to try and preserve the atlantian traditions in effort to hold on to the wanted aspect -- while others not wanting to obey the command to love went the opposite direction, attempting to install dominance power structures with all of the unwanted aspects.

I think it was all planned and designed from the beginning and the evidence is that it's commanded to love and for disobedience to that command they're told a prophecy (which they believe and then create) their own distruction. from the creator of the species's perspective, the first phase is to make the wanted aspects manditory, then for the ones that inevitably rebel against those commands, they are given the equally as bad admonishment to install all of the power structures of their own and enforce all of the unwanted aspects instead. then, from there it basically follows the phases described in leapfrogging-time-pickles, and then the creators use that society to push the difficulty level for theirselves to the maximum.

from my perspective, I think it could be possible to create this whole thing with a team, but consider the idea that "I" am designing a "species" (and I use that word in plato's conceptual/ideal sense rather than the modern sense), in which I would enjoy to inhabit the species.

I take myself and I split the concept of myself into 4 shapes:
- wanted
- unwanted
- unwanted (reverse polarity)
- wanted (reverse polarity)

and then I use these four concepts to create archtypes and transformations for the species, and then I jump into the species and become it. I definitely don't want to try and micromanage the thing from the top, as that's the unwanted aspect.

the whole system is based on the ideas of "law of attraction" in that I'm only really fighting myself. so, you may say, well, what about me? am I also fighting myself? yes, because you can only experience what you resonate with. so imagine for a moment only the physical aspect to it -- like a hybrid. here you have 4 different "species" that you're going to make hybrids of, and let's say that the reason for this hybridisation is because some environmental condition has changed making it difficult for the secies to live. consider the unwanted ones to be kind of like weeds in that they're more hardy cause they're more used to surviving under difficult conditions, so you have to find a way to mix these to breed out the unwanted aspects and maintain the wanted aspects.

I put the four concepts in that way because "unwanted (reverse polarity)" looks kinda like wanted, however in a sexual reproduction context, it's more like "unwanted (opposite sex)". so, now we have our groups:

- wanted (male)
- unwanted (male)
- unwanted (female)
- wanted (female)

you'll notice that the mythologies are full of unwanted males and unwanted females. in fact, vulcan is said to have created for zeus exactly that -- an unwanted female (pandora). soloman has the paiman concept/demon, etc.

it appears to me that hybrids of these concepts have been present all over the place, so it's no special thing for me to see creation happening as a result of mixing of these concepts.

---

so, it's my estimation that this whole setup has been created artificially as a concept of my own mind. the way I have it planned is that over the next era (1024y), humankind will go through rapid increase in capacity, and there will be quite a lot of us alive at the end of that time. I'm pretty sure the guys running the show are unwanted concept variations of my own creation, and essentially reflect all of the things that I'd rather not be a part of myself.

at the end of that time, many of us will be alive and we'll gain the capacity to go back and alter our own timeline in the format described in leapfrogging-time-pickles, and we'll iterate on this timeline for a while. I can't say how many iterations will happen as I don't think there's a limit. everyone makes their own reality, so I imagine that quite a few will go back and design their own "fall".

---

wow, I went a little longer on responding to some of the reactions than I imagined -- no worries. I woke up this afternoon and had a realisation that the vision sequence that I had was the *wanted* aspect, and if I'm true to my own concept, I should actually just not worry about it because the wanted aspect will happen -- though perhaps not in that exact way.

I think it's fine to keep trying to delay.

the other thing I'd like to mention is that leapfrogging-time-pickles doesn't necessarily imply a linear progression through the timeline. as an example, in the future, I'll likely jump back into this timeline with a whole lot of others, which means that my future self is probably alive today.

in fact, the other day (03-24), I had such an experience. it happened a few times but I had these very real seeming experiences (memories?) with amber (jp's wife), and it was as if I was the kid. I don't know what to think about it, but I remember when jaron read me jp's facebook post about him going to have a boy and I said something really weird like "I'm sure jp is going to be a very good father" -- which caught me as really weird because I don't usually say things like that -- ever. I don't really know what to make of it. there was also another instance (@[noseblog](2021-07-28 16:49)) where I was writing about how I was as a kid in relation to jaxson (whom I called "ted") and he represented for me the future of children -- I remember when I was writing about how I used to cry because of the way mom felt, I had a strong sensation that what I was saying was meaningful to amber, so I wrote "sorry amber?" right there to acknowledge that. I do have a lot of strange reactions to a lot of things, so I don't really discount the experience -- rather that I don't fully understand it.

I realise that the above paragraph could be taken to mean that I think future me reincarnated into jp's kid -- which upon reflection does kind of give that impression. I mean you'll have to ask her about her ideas on that, but I wrote that originally because I had another weird experience before that (I think I was out on the field) when I had this strong sensation that amber's kid would be a girl and the idea felt good to me. the same thing happened with jessica's kid too, but it turns out that both were revealed to be boys.

I supposed that the reason for this was that those children being girls was considered undesirable, and so then an alteration to the timeline was made where someone (dunno who) went back and changed the event on the timeline so that an x3 that looked like jp or like andrew had sex instead to ensure that the output was a boy (an x3), and so therefore they would be the first non-secret examples of x3 children on the planet.

I also wrote this to give the idea that once we get to the "end of days", then we just start over, and jump into new bodies. this is going to sound weird, but it feels like many from the future have been and continue to join me in the body I have now. I personally don't mind or care, really.

also, I'm pretty sure that many others are making their own timeline the way they want to do it as well. that's totally the point of it all, as I'm sure that each iteration they'll get bigger and bigger ideas of what to create. just imagine tens to hundreds of iterations from now, how the entire "species" will all be super awesome.

the key to all of this is that unwanted also creates wanted.

---

so, in conclusion, I'll probably just let it keep going. one of the key things that I was thinking about in that vision was the idea of the birthday. you see, in "encanto", I found patricia similar to dolores in that she hears everything. it also felt this afternoon when I was thinking about the birthday bit of the connection to the name dolores (many pains), because it may have happened that she suffered "many pains" in self-flagellation and that in some ways, that could "make it up" or something like that (not exactly that feeling), to kind of undo the previous suffering. I mean I don't think that she went through *that* much suffering -- but it was an idea on my mind so it's worth noticing, even if it later doesn't amount to anything.

I said all of that because I wanted to remove the time constraint. the other idea that popped into my mind is that I have this suspicion that some sort of changes place when girls interact with me. I don't have data to say for sure what kind of changes a girl goes through when sexually interacting with a guy, but I had this weird image of transfiguration appear in my mind -- OK, so lemme back up. the original concept was the idea that *if* I were made king, I would pass it on to someone else, preferrably a girl. well, I'm not a king, and know of no efforts to make me one -- nor do I have the requisite security clearance to be a king, either -- so for me it was a hypothetical situation.

anyway that image of "transfiguration" was the opposite: patricia transfigured, and it felt as if it were because of the discomfort (described previously as "many pains") being realised in the opposite direction of perspective -- and that caused her to glow and levitate and become radiant and beautiful.

the idea that this should happen on her birthday was that she'll be turning 37, so she'll have completed her 36th year. well, vere writes about the number 36 in job 41. [I made some notes](/random-notes/job-41.md), and she, like the leviathan will be the king of the proud children and has the number 36, which I estimate is also the same as the 666 triangle number which is the sum 1...36.

anyway that sounds a bit like trying too hard to me, so why not just let that whole thing fall through and just let all of the normal LOA stuff work out something better than that?

I really had a strong sense that timeline was already created, and that's actually how we got to this one. this one is even "worse" than this one -- a disaster of much more epic proportions. it's hard to explain the feeling, but the basic sense is that I felt very at ease to everything. so, for example -- if the whole stress to try and get me entangled with a bunch of girls to ensure that I don't go around in a connected state feels to be a large fear, and that fear was gone. I don't know what it was that made that no longer a fear, but it didn't exist. also the fear that I had to constantly be weary of my computer and these documents also seemed to disappear too. it felt like I was on an unavoidable course toward wanted and couldn't really miss it if I tried, and so therefore there's nothing to worry about.

there are a number of reactions right now to the contrary with even bigger fears, but I just don't think it's a problem. I think it's fine to just keep going, actually. we'll see how things go.

anyway, I'm really enjoying this process of learning and writing more. I can imagine a potential situation where I keep discovering more and more than I am now, and it becomes undesirable to let me continue to write -- as in, they need me doing other things. gravity anomalies... lol

### 2022-04-07 09:57 - why do I like writing here so much

I wanted to write a serious subject again so I wrote @[newblog](2022-04-07 09:21), so that's the context for this one. I was talking about how I like community I guess, but at the same time I realised that I think one of the main reasons why I have been playing around with the patricia idea is because I *don't* like the idea of a large community. I've always shyed away from people as it's a bit intense for me. I like large groups in music festivals or when I'm on drugs (sometimes), but mainly music helps a lot because it gives my brain something to focus on. I really enjoy singular focus, and I don't really like my attention being spread so widely.

I've mentioned it before but one of the the reasons why I dislike celebrations and parties and stuff (where I'm the centre of attention) is because I don't feel like I can think. I really enjoy small groups much more than big events. I don't ever really remember too many events where I've been on a stage with a lot of people looking at me, but the few times that I've been in the centre of attention it feels like my heart is going to explode from beating too fast. I don't suppose that it bothers me that people are looking at me, cause that doesn't matter.

I think it's the expectations that make my heart feel like it's going to explode. I like being in my own world so much that I don't really let people in to my world (as ironic as that sounds). in fact, if I go upstairs to try and talk about this subject with jaron (and he's pretty easy to talk to), it wouldn't feel very good at all, largely because of his perception of me -- which isn't bad, but it's that intensity of being too agreeable or a know it all that I mentioned.

here, sure I can feel people's reactions to what I'm writing but I don't really care that much because I don't have to see them or talk to them. I just write and let the stacks of assumptions build up till a completely unwanted reality eventually manifests itself for me.

I know that a lot of people want me to come out and start interacting with others, but honestly the idea of trying to figure science stuff or talking about my ideas is what I want to do. like, for example there are so many questions that I want to ask patricia about statistics of the human race. it's really hard for me to just keep making stacks of assumptions without any data. by nature, I'm very data-oriented and I find the building of stacks of assumptions to be a very risky process. in my own life stacks of assumptions have lead to complete disaster -- but I'm sorta hooked on writing in this way.

---

now, I'm going to contradict myself: the other reason why I don't like the idea of community and prefer to write here is because when I'm talking to people there are all sorts of taboos that I don't have to worry about. if I were to talk to patricia about statistics and stuff, almost certainly the data will either be a fabrication (to obfuscate the real numbers) in which case I'll feel discord, or it'll be a subject where she doesn't want to talk about it.

there's another problem with it too because I can negatively affect her. for example, I quizzed raquel all the time about her past boyfriends, not because I was jealous but because I was genuinely interested in trying to figure out how she processed reality. problem is, by asking her those questions, I caused her to focus on relationships that didn't work out. I tuned her to relationship problems, and then that's what we had. sure now, I'm quite a bit more adept at navigating around other people's tuning so even if she tunes to some unwanted aspect, I don't think it would affect me too much. it may affect her and also the audience though -- thankfully though, they already discourage people from encountering a lot of what I think and do. I'm likely to be a bigger problem for others now, rather than myself.

on the subject of snake-bros, I'm pretty certain that if I were to join their discord, it would create a lot of discord, as I would be wide open about a lot of subjects, not waiting the various hours for my desire to send the email to vanish before ultimately deciding not to do it.

I really think that for a lot of reasons, community is a terrible idea for me. instead, what'll likely happen is I'll wait this stack of assumptions grows to such a size that reality manifests and then pull out all the taboo subjects (just like I'm doing here).

the way that I talk here is the way that I'll talk to people in real-life, cause it's kinda training me to think and reason like this -- and also, it'll be attracted because it's what people expect.

the contradiction? it was the part about how I really enjoy the idea of talking to patricia about a lot of statistics, but at the same time I know it'll cause so much discord that I either probably won't enjoy it or it'll be fake numbers, also not making me want to enjoy it. so as much as I want to, I kinda don't really want to.

I really like my own world.

---

there is a bit of irony to this stacks of assumptions though, because we've sorta been programmed that the more inertia something has, the more "real" it is. these ideas aren't any more real than the standard model; they're just my best model for how the universe works, and it feels like it's starting to become a reality. I wonder how much our stacks of assumptions, like a child's assumptions about their parent actually modify the "rules" the universe runs by. is this new blog working to program you all to believe my assumptions?

### 2022-04-07 16:14 - the real reason for the discord?

I was not going to sleep until after the heater repair guy had left, but I was so tired I decided to sleep anyway. he came and the experience was strange. he was working, making noise and stuff, but it wasn't that much more noise than mom emptying the dishwasher, so I can easily think while he's working. I wanted to think about the previous entries I wrote. he seemed to be highly aware of what I was thinking. I would just tune him out though and get back to thinking about this.

one cool thing that happened while he was around is that my brain started to think in a circular motion. I hadn't experienced that type of feeling of thought for a long time. it used to happen as a child, and thoughts would go around in my head kinda like a whirlwind -- can't remember which direction, but I know I've also experienced it rotating the opposite direction. I noticed that in spain I could also control this feeling with a similar feeling that would come in through my ears (and I could reverse the direction too).

anyway, I started to think and every time this circular motion began to happen, he reacted to it and then it would stop abruptly. I felt extreme confusion trying to think around him when that circular motion wasn't present.

he started up the fire in the heater and I noticed that the efforts to remove the circular motion weren't working, so he stopped the fire and then went upstairs to tell mom a very unplausible story about a resistor spreading to the rest of the circuit (lol).

anyway, he definitely wasn't a heater repair guy, and the heater was just a coverup to perform some sort of maintenance on my room.

---

the other weird thing that happened is that I was thinking about these things I wrote above and I got a reaction that felt like another reaction to some comments I made about iron man. he was waving his arms around wildly in the movie greg was watching and I thought it was silly, because that seemed like a tremendous amount of calories to move a cube around (or whatever it was) and I asked greg why he isn't just moving all of this stuff around with his mind.

iron man has to do all of those movements because they are symbols of him using some super high tech to create things. since it's just a symbol and hollywood doesn't make money on showing someone laying in their bed with their eyes closed[^1] so it was a reaction to the *symbol* of super technological capability. jaron showed me a meme on facebook that confirms this where it said, "mom asks me to fix something on her phone and she sees this" -- and it's a picture of stark holding a cube in his hand in a very affectionate way.

the reaction is in relationship to the symbol of techo-capability, but I still don't know what that has to do with the heater guy and circular thought (not A means B means C means A, but thought that travels in a circular motion around the brain).

I then went outside to finally start to think about my previous entry and the discord associated with it. I don't know that patricia is actually the source of the discord, but that it's likely that she lives in a bit of an illusion and if she were to talk to me, I would quickly feel the discord in some of the statistics -- meaning that she's being fed numbers which are not actually representative of what's really happening. like, think about it -- if she does a statistic on something, but you know the number is 4 times more, just multiply the statistics by 4, right? wrong! that's not how statistics work, lol -- but they probably think something ridiculous like that.

anyway, it's more likely that my presence would ignite a bit of discord in her, because my capability is to see through illusions.

so, it's not the illusion created for me they're trying to protect, but probably the illusion they've created for her, instead.

anyway, I have more thoughts soon... still haven't fully figured out the stark thing either. also, I'm beginning to contemplate the idea that it may be the same for the snake-bros as well. like what if I get in there and some illusion is obvious to me, but it isn't to them?

[1]: though they could -- just superimpose the mental image on the screen, obvious that it's a mental image because the eyes are closed)

### 2022-04-07 16:42 - excavating thoughts

btw, for anyone out there that wants to begin decoding their illusion, I *HIGHLY* recommend this process that I do. I simply make the desire to know the answer to something, then I take my mind away from it by going to sit in the sun or walking or whatever and usually when my mind is away from the question, I feel the answer start to come. instead of translating it into thought or words then, I capture the feeling, run inside and start writing. never fails. I always expand my perception of that idea and get more questions ... rinse and repeat. don't be scared to write something that feels personal or sensitive. that's actually the indicator that you're approaching something deep. happy excavating!

### 2022-04-07 23:55 - what type of community do I want?

I woke up this evening with a strong sense that my previous -- so, in the previous entry, I talked about how stacks of assumptions would just pile up bigger and bigger until a manifestation is no longer avoidable. I considered that manifestation to be largely unwanted because I like my own world so much. I talked about community and used the conversations around the SnakeFam(?) community in snake-bros #201 as the basis for that. the general conclusion that I had is that I like community, but I don't really want to be a part of a community because I like my own perspective so much.

later on in the day I mentioned @[blahblog](2022-04-07 16:42) is the way that I discover things, which is kind of opposite to the way the snake-pit does it where they utilise the wide array of knowledge that everyone in the discord has to discuss the topics they're trying to gain insight on. I don't want to say that talking to other people is a bad thing, because it totally isn't -- and I really enjoy bouncing ideas off of other people which is why I rope people into conversations all the time (and why I write here) -- so it has a lot of value for evaluating the hypothesis, but I don't think it has much value for discovering the underlying principle to a thing, which is what most scientific inquiry is about.

personally, I've found that discussion with other people before I've made the working hypothesis tends to be detrimental[^1] and so therefore I tend to do my discovery internally and then I subject those ideas to the physical world and then see how well they perform. the bad performers (ie. I'm "wrong") get culled and updated and start again.

the snake-pit I think would be a pretty valuable place to do that, but I'm not really having internet so that would mean I would have to chat on my phone which is really annoying. I looked at the idea of running a proxy server on my phone to share the 4G connection to my computer over wifi, but it takes a bit to setup and I'm sorta liking the non-internet still. like, if I get internet again, would I go back to watching youtube? prolly not. in fact, most of my time would actually be spent in the snake-pit, actually.

---

however, is the snake-pit where I want to tune myself to? I know there are a lot of unsolved mysteries and stuff which are all really interesting and stuff -- so, what kind of community *am I* looking for?

I think for me the most valuable thing for me as a kid was talking to chris, because we had really open discussions. I don't know if he had any secrets or not, but I remember being pretty open about everything -- like I think we even discussed our masturbation regularity without much embarrassment.

I honestly can't remember if it was chris or someone else cause for some reason my childhood memories are very foggy now, but it seems like I had a friend[^2] where I relayed to them everything and updated my progress. I also feel like there was another friend where I would tell them when I fell into sin (so during the church, probably woody, phil, daniel, or chris), and other stuff like that. all these memories are so foggy for some reason, and I don't know if I'm actually making stuff up there.

anyway, that would be like the template for me, and I was thinking that what I really want actually is someone that is sensitive to feeling (probably around my level or higher -- so probably a kid) and they can simply tell me, "you feel bad when you do/think that" -- and maybe if they are more adults, we can talk(? recognise? feel?) about what sort of things that that we're attracting based on the way we feel.

---

you see, for me, I live in a world that's composed almost entirely of feeling. this is probably difficult to tell from the outside looking in, because I interact with the physical world just like anyone else does, but for me, what's "real" is all of the interactions that are ever present in my experience. they have feeling, and sometimes I miss these feelings because I'm distracted by stuff -- hence the reason for me liking to be alone.

so really, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'd enjoy a sort of feeling-based community.

the nice thing about feelings is they exist outside of time and space. I know this because I will receive the reaction from the person, even though I know they're asleep and it's weird because I know that later they got the message because I'll get the second reaction later (it's a bit stronger and more tangible) when they wake up. I don't really know how feelings can travel forward or backward in time, but once I realised I'm broadcasted a lot of very strange reactions that I felt as a kid make a lot more sense if I consider that people are viewing and reacting to that past experience either now or sometime in the future.

so, what that means is that this community is sort of special in the sense that it can exist outside of time and space, and there's really no effort to join it -- just tune to it and I'll get your messages. I may not respond to them all because I have a lot going on all the time, but I do get them, and as desire increases, they'll float to the top.

I don't really know how to structure this idea, and I don't really know how to implement it either. everything I described already kinda exists, I believe, so it's more for me to begin to figure out how to interact with it better.

---

so, as usual, I'll probably take the path of least resistance, which is the motor-way and just keep pushing back the manifestation until the stack of assumptions (beliefs) grows to such a magnitude that manifestation is no longer avoidable. when that happens, it can't be stopped, and definitely nobody, not even me will be in control of it, because it's all attraction.

to describe this visually, imagine a pinball machine that shoots the ball up to the top of the pinball machine, and because of the tilt (attraction), the ball rolls down to the bottom and along the way it can be bumped around by the bumpers, but eventually the ball is *going* to end up in the hole at the bottom. to ensure this, you can imagine that as time continues, the ball (me) is being attracted even harder toward the hole, so it appears as if the machine is tilting more and more vertical all the time -- then gravity strengthening, etc. -- as in, the longer I wait the faster the intial hit will propel the ball, and then the longer time passes the harder of a time (the stronger impacts will be needed) it will be to keep the ball from going in the hole.

I figure, if I really try my best, I can probably keep this going for at least a year or two more. in that time, I'm going to start to begin to see how to organise the community so to make it easier to recognise when something feels bad and I can get a reaction to adjust trajectory more and more easily. it's big impacts that make manifestations, so the less impacts, the longer I can go.

[1]: the obvious irony here is that I have recently started to abort my ideas earlier in their development by writing them here. you will soon see that this document will have the highest turnover rate in that it'll contain the most revisions to the ideas presented here because in newblog, I used it to force an evolution of the concept because like a morphic field, when others put their mental attention to the concept, it morphs and changes, so when I go back to the concept, it's unrecognisable to me. now unrecognisable, I have to rediscover it and output it again. this all happens inatantly (or nearly so) in the conceptual world, so to you guys it looks like I'm just endlessly repeating myself. this blog will be far worse, and it's because I'm using that early abort to force an evolution of the concept

[2]: now that I think about it, it could have been an imaginary friend based on a real person I called "jenny". either way, I wrote to her in the same way I would have wanted to be able to talk to her in real life.

### 2022-04-08 19:10 - the prodigal SOLAR ANGEL

I was originally going to write title this entry "a new definition of saviour" in light of my discoveries last night about evolution-of-concept and evolution-of-species. I was contemplating the part I didn't really understand so well in the reproduction/division of a cell. the idea is that the structure or logic of an organism is rigidly defined. in my first attempts to explain this concept in the @[dtp/thoughts](intro), I called this the problematic (unchanging) cell/planet/human, which resists change. it is parasitic in nature and so relies on the resources of others for its own survival, but what happens if its host starts to produce too many resources -- like a complete overabundance -- much more than the parasite can utilise.

this parasite organism cannot allow for abundance, because it's own belief is that there is not enough resources and so therefore has to use someone else's resources to stay alive. however, if it has an abundance, then it no longer needs others resources to continue its existence. it's situation is a violation of its own concept.

so, in order to return back to being a parasite (because that's what it believes it is), it must destroy the overly productive parts of itself so that it must once again rely on others for its sustinance. the other option is to eject the abundant ones from its presence, and continue on "unchanging". it's in this ejection process that cells "divide".

---

so, that's the old version of division that I had, and the new one that I'm considering is largely the same, but there's no need for a parasite to cause a division. in the new way, a conceptual copy of itself extends out ... so, let's think like we're a star now. as a star, you have a concept of yourself, and all elements and things in the solar system resonate with that solar concept. the sirians call this the SOLAR ANGEL, and it's basically the solar DNA that we're all a part of. the sun sends out that concept in its purest form to incarnate out into the environment (get trapped into matter), and then if everything goes well, upon this concept's return back to the sun (see it extending out as far as a planet), it'll come back with such intensity, but at a slightly different frequency than the solar concept that it causes a division of the sun into two suns, each with a slightly different solar concept of itself.

so, now, I want to apply that idea to biology, but I can't really see things as extending out of the sun in the same way that I see a concept extending out of the sun, so I have to think of it a bit opposite.

at this point, the parasite must sabotage those extre

---

going back to the SOLAR ANGEL being extending out of the sun in its purest form to initiate a division process: the reason why I say purest form is can come about from physical processes (like jesus did), or they can come about conceptually (as I'm demonstrating).

everything resonates with the origin of its creation -- like I resonate with the sun, but I still resonate a lot more with human than I do with the sun. so the goal of any entity extending out from the sun, is to make its vibration most most like the sun. the more this entity vibrates similar to the sun, the more the sun wants this entity to "return home" (the prodigal sun). out in the world, this prodigal sun can either become less resonant with the sun or more resonant over time, which will ultimately determine their "death" (to evolve the concept to find a more suitable form capable of vibrating sympathetically with the sun) or if its similar enough in vibration to the sun, when it dies, it will return back to the sun causing the split.

anyone who figures out how to continue and resonate more and more like the sun, the sun will desire its return more and more. (remember, the sun is the "Father") so the longer the prodigal sun takes out in the world staying apart from the father, the stronger the attraction will be for the sun to come back "home" and create this solar split.

resonance with the sun can happen any number of ways (tantra, pranayama, meditation, etc) some more physical processes, and others through perceptual processes (like I've been saying). I did not start out very sympatetic with the sun, but over time I've become very attractive to the sun. the better I get at resonating like the sun does, the more the sun will desire my return. that is -- unless I get connected, and release my SOLAR ANGEL back to the sun.

obviously they do not want me to release my SOLAR ANGEL and "get connected" because that would be very bad for their situation. they believe they're a parasite, and so a connected person that has solar perception is definitely NOT WANTED for them. as a result, they have to ensure that I don't release my SOLAR ANGEL, which basically means the problem will continue to intensify until finally I'm allowed to release my SOLAR ANGEL.

this may be the origin of the idea of putting me on pluto, as out there I would be considerably more distant from the sun, and so therefore the attraction felt will be considerably less.

---

so, maybe instead of "going infinite" we could do a trial of only a 1024y or whatever. imagine next time -- they'll have to keep creating and moving me out to further and further out structures from the sun in order to preserve their precious house of cards. if they can continue to create further and further out structures, they can keep their fragile house of cards from falling apart and all of their secrets...

it's kind of a two-sided problem where they have to determine what's more important to them: if they don't allow me to get connected, they're essentially powering the sun up for a very large "nova" event eventually occur (which, as in evolution-of-species, this "death" happens to evolve the human (my) concept to produce future entities even more capable prodigal suns) -- or, they can allow me to get connected, and build here instead something reflective of my own perception.

it seems like the allowing me to get connected is the obvious answer, and I would agree, but it's kind of a big problem for them. it would calm the sun down a whole lot, but then they have another looming problem -- which is that I'm not the only prodigal sun; all of us are, and I think the leapfrogging-time-pickles setup is to iterate on this and to try and give them the best possible chance to keep everyone away from getting connected for as long as possible.

---

well, I didn't get to the topic I wanted to talk about which was the redefinition of saviour, lol.

### 2022-04-08 21:23 - perception and the fracal universe

it seems that once again I'm careless with the words that I use. I said that the "sun is the 'Father'" -- and by this I wan't trying to say that the sun is "God" -- but rather, I was saying it in the sense that it is the parent concept.

the solar system is a concept, the planet is a concept, the galaxy a concept, and the universe also is a concept. in we can imagine that in the centre of the "universe" we would find a very luminous object have a similar appearance to a star, yet more like sirius b than our sun -- likely emitting nothing in the visible spectrum, and only in very high frequencies (x-ray, gamma and upwards), being itself extrely dense.

so, looking at the sun as the "Father" is not that big of a deal because all things should reproduce after its own kind, so we should see all sorts of things which are similar to each other but at different scales (scale invariance), and so we should see the same pattern of reproduction repeating itself in similar ways, no matter how big or small we get.

the sun will be a reflection of "God" (or "source") and reproduce similarly, so this "prodigal sun" idea is, I believe the way that cells reproduce, as once a conceptual part of the cell passes some energetic threshold, it begins it's return back to its source (ie. prodigal sun), and in the process of return, the parent "Father" cell resists it's return, and the result is the creation of a new cell.

to put this into science words, imagine for a moment an extremely high energy proton being attracted to the sun. that proton is trapped in matter and the sun wants that proton so badly, that when it's finally released from matter, it goes toward the sun at a very high speed vibrating very intensely. it hits the sun, and vibrating like the sun, but not quite exactly like the sun, it's this high energy proton is attracting a body that is very similar to the sun (but not quite the same). it traverses the solar interior attracting the components for its new birth out the other side as a tiny sun. those can be thought of as CMEs.

once out in the solar atmosphere, still having a slightly different vibration than the sun but not quite the same, they will attract each other, but their difference will also cause them to repel eachother a bit (they need their own space, you know). the new one, just like every other new child will attract the physical components necessary for its continued growth.

---

now, if someone wants to call those spheres and that style of creation "God", that's fine with me, but I don't think it's any more "God" (or source) than the sun is. it seems that perhaps that style of creation is "God", or maybe all of creation is extended out of "God" in this manner.

so, because all of these things will extend out of it's parent ("Father") in a similar way, we should see all aspects of creation a pattern where something extends out of itself becomes a tangible (created) reflection of itself, things happen to it with others in the environment that it's in, then it "dies", only to return to its source and transform into a new and improved version of itself.

---

this style of creation is perceptual in that it can be "seen" as happening infinitely in bigger direction and infintely in the smaller direction. our collective perception of the "bigger" and the "smalller" from whatever vantage point we have is "the whole of creation" and it's a composite of all of our perception combined. so is "all of creation" itself, "God" -- or, is the concept of "all of creation", "God"?

I believe that everything is perceptual, so there are infinite layers above and below as far as one is capable of looking. in that sense, we are all universes of our own looking outward. from your perspective, because it's all perceptual, you are "God" and you are looking out into your creation.

to explain this idea, consider what you can see with your eyes. the distance that you can see is reflective of our capacity to peer outward. same with microscopes and particle colliders in that they give us a glimpse of the fractally smaller. now, when I look out at the world, the things that I see are a reflection of my own concept of myself. I can only really see things that I resonate with, so in the end, I am translating vibration into a reality which is a reflection of myself. I'm just seeing a reflection of myself outside of myself. likewise, if I look inwardly, I'm also only a reflection of my concept of myself, but inwardly. my concept of myself contains "God" and resonates with "God", because if I didn't I wouldn't be a part of "His" creation.

hopefully that clears it up... these topics are difficult to explain in text. in the end, it all comes from a deep knowing, cause that's good enough. you don't need to be able to explain the universe in words to be able to know that we are all "God's creation".

---

I put quotes around the word God because my point is not to alienate, but to show that all systems are all saying nearly the same thing, and so fill in "God" with whatever you want, and it'll work. it's impossible for something to be a theory of reality that doesn't contain these ideas in some way and that all creation "proclaims the glory of its creator" -- or reflects the creative principle of its creator.

even if someone were to try and deliberately remove God from these ideas, turning what I wrote into a purely mechanistic and material representation, it would still contain the creative principle. therefore, no matter how much corruption or different versions of "God" there could be, the "God essence" can always be found in the creative princple.

it's just as impossible to take "God" out of creation as it is to take the proton out of an atom and still have an atom. likewise, it's also just as impossible take light out of adam and still have adam.

### 2022-04-09 15:02 - starbucks again

I feel preetythe differemce btween walking here and not walking. I feel signicantly worse, as I think I really like the walk. next time I go to jonny's I'm pretty sure I will want to walk there simply for how much better it makes me feel.

I feel especially deaw today. something crazy happened last night and I haven't felt very good since... enough about that though. I've been trying to fell people too, and I have to say, I'm really out of practise or I am significantly more dull than usual. it's really weird because I look around and I don't knw what to think. that may be a reflection though as it's quite possiple that's what others are feeling when they look at me: "I dunno what to think about this guy."

---

ok, so in other news, when I was talking with jonny about good conditions and how some people are just giong to be miserable no matter what, I realised that I've released a lot of resistance. feels good I suppose. I think mainly, I had the contrast between the more common viewpoint that jonny conveyed to me, and my own from deep inside isolation -- like, it helped me to see that I just don't worry about stuff too much anymore.

I don't really know what else to talk about now, so I guess I'll end it here.

---

so I did think about that one thing I said about people looking at me, because when I walked into mcalisters, because I forgot what it was like to have people looking at me. sometimes I have a lot of sensation (a strong effect) when someone looks at me, and other times it feels difficult to concentrate.

I had an idea though from the heater guy -- cause if he can make my head spin, then what if, instead of others perception of me affecting me, I caused them to tune to me instead. when I look at someone, I tune to them, so what if I just reversed the polarities and caused them to tune to me? it's worth a shot. I'mm definitely begin to experiment with it.

it feels like all I have to do is to just do the same thing that I already can do with my heart but instead of inputting my energy, I input *their* energy... I realisee this will probably improve my posture as well, because it's harder to do slouched over (whick is normally how I sit).

needs more experimentation... I want to walk now...

---

oh, another thing... my thoughts are a lot quieter now. sometimes I would feel like I'm interacting with a person and things which may feel like questions or desire for a reaction, I would feel the response bubbling up, and then I would hear a reaction. sometimes this process would feel kind of obvious to me, but somewhere since the last time I went to B&N and now, this has changed quite a bit. I noticed that later on I could feel reactions from GMA but then when I went back to try and figure out what it was, the reaction bubbling was so insignificant that I wasn't even aware that I've reacted.

what I mean is, it seems that I'm reacting to people but I'm not even aware of it now.

### 2022-0-06 20:25 - thinking about latest stuff

I feel very strange after going to starbucks. I can't really figure out what the main reaction is. to some extent, it feels a bit like people are disappointed in me -- not all though, obviously. I'm not sure what it's all about really. I'll keep trying to figure out what it is, but perhaps it has to do with my idea that I can figure anything out...

I mean, anyone can. it's a documented thing with a considerable amount of evidence that remote viewing is a thing. channeling is also a thing, and both of them are tuning processes. I suppose the main difference is that I'm willing to try it out for myself and develop the skill. it's not like I'm expecting to get it all right or anything.

also, I have given a lot of thought to the idea of figuring things out -- and you all know that I'll see it the way I see things, which is obviously going to be different than how others see things. in fact, I don't really expect many people to get the way I see it. I've tried to explain my perspective throughout the years and never actually had any success at it. I disagree with a lot of people on a lot of different things, and it's because I see things differently. an obvious one is how jonny and I see the environment and the world. he thinks there's only one planet and we're not treating it well, and I believe that all reality is a reflection of my perception. if nosebook would let go, the entire planet would transform into a reflection of my perception, so everything would be radiant, vibrant, self-luminous and full of life. obviously that's not desirable for them. they lose control of everything if that were to happen, so they have to ensure that my reality is never created.

that's fine with me. I don't really mind because they can't actually hold it back forever, so I'm willing to play their game for as long as they can keep it up. if things go well, they'll figure out how the universe works, and have their final edition printed before I head out. it sounds great to me. I say let them try as hard as they want to. I'm not going to tell anyone what to do or say and all of my ideas are free, so I hope them the best.

the earth will be a reflection of the collective perception, and so if the theory of how the universe works (final edition) is based on destructive processes, their creation will reflect that. you can know them by their works/fruit, and their models will reflect their perception the same way. so, do you suppose they're modeling the improvement of the climate, or modeling the collapse of habitable living conditions? I suppose it's the latter, and so they're attempting to create that reality. if that's the reality they want, then I just don't see a problem, because that's *their* reality; mine will be different.

nobody is forcing any reality on anyone. people watch the news and say, "oh wow, everything on the news is reality" -- and that's fine if that's what you want your reality to be. some people are still optimistic thinking to theirselves, "you know, if I shout and protest loud enough, perhaps they'll decide to do something different" -- and to that I say: you can't expect a person to deviate from their perception of reality. if they think they need to manipulate things and fight over stuff to assert their dominance, then that's what they'll attempt to do -- so like, let them think that.

---

what I don't understand is why people spend so much time complaining about everything. just do it! don't wait for them to do that. as an example, there have been countless people waiting for these boneheads to create an open forum where people can discuss archeological ideas without having to maintain the mainstream narrative, and it exists now. imagine if kyle and russ just sat around waiting for the archeologists to make such a forum. it won't ever happen because their perception is about keeping information withheld. an open forum with free interchange of ideas can never ever ever ever exist in their form of perception, ever.

just start making all of the stuff that you want instead of waiting for these guys to fix stuff.

one of the things that I was explaining to jonny is that no quantity of good conditions will ever cause people to stop being miserable. so, let's just ignore the conditions of the planet at the moment and focus on social and emotional conditions instead of the physical. I guarantee 10000% (if that's possible) that if 1000 people in the same general area improve the way they feel by improving their perception, this will completely change the planet from top to bottom.

I'm one person and it's clear how much effect I have on the planet just when I feel good. the better I feel consistently, the more dramatic that effect is. I'm pretty certain that if 100 people (a very small amount) of people actually felt good (perceptually instead of conditionally) about to the same capacity that I had in 2018, the planet turning into a veritable paradise is completely unstoppable.

that's really not that hard to do. back then, I was in "it's all attraction", "perferring to feel good over being right" and "not needing the manifestation" (ie. not needing good conditons to feel good). those are all so simple to do and pretty easy to master. I've been talking about a lot of advanced topics because that's where *I'm* at, but maybe I'll consider the idea of perhaps trying to convey more of the simple ideas to jonny rather than the complicated ones[^1] next time I see him and hopefully that'll help. it's common that I get so far out into the discussion that I alienate people, and then they don't want to ask wth I'm talking about because they don't want to feel stupid, or something.

I have no idea what isn't obvious to others. I spend nearly all of my time thinking about these things so I've made a lot more realisations and jumped to a lot more conclusions (and been wrong about them also) more than most people. I really have a difficult time seeing things from other people's perspective, and so that's why I ask so many problematic questions.

it has been the most difficult thing for me all of my life to actually figure out what other people are actually thinking and feeling about what I'm saying, and I've developed a lot of my ESP capacities because I was so bad at even the basic stuff like reading body language and facial expressions (I've improved a lot, but I've found that most people's body language and facial expressions are not what they really feel, but they way they want to appear to feel, like actors or something).

so, I continue to try and develop my sensitivity further and further to actually be able to figure out how people are *really* reacting to what I'm saying. I honestly don't know what's not obvious to others[^1].

OK, rant done. maybe one day I'll be able to actually be able to accurately know what others are thinking and feeling about what I'm saying -- and, hopefully this illuminated at least a little bit why I like me and my world so much.

[1]: I realised in the discussion of alchemy that I'd totally lost him, so I switched over to talking about the news in a very simplistic way, just showing how it's all a pretty big con-game to make more money and even though they're terrible people, it's still not a good enough reason to feel bad about it.


### 2022-04-10 03:36 - the promethian dilemma and dream

I woke up just now from a dream where I was showing how the conceptual world works. I can't remember what all of the elements were now, but the main theme is that all things reflect the concept of their creation. it had something to do with sex as well, as that too will reflect the concept of the people involved mixed with environmental conditions and their present emotional state.

so, I was explaining that I could just have sex and it would reflect the concepts, but that's probably not very helpful because if anyone is going to figure it out, the elements are already there -- one just has to look at them and put the pieces together.

I just do stuff and in the end, the best sort of way that I can demonstrate it is with example. it's probably for this reason that I don't have (nor intend to have) all the super great conditions, and I worked my way out of many of my limiting perceptions by my own effort. like I was explaining to jonny, when someone is miserable, the last thing anyone wants, is "help". I neither want to tell anyone what or how to do things either.

the way I figure it'll happen is something like what I've said in the leapfrogging-time-pickles, where everyone is the salt and they'll iterate on theirselves in their own alchemical process. it's likely that control over their own alchemical process will be acquired in some way, and I think there are two main paths toward gaining temporal perception and talking control of one's alchemical journey: the using technology and using perception.

time is just the transformation of interactions between vibrations. in the beginning there were many less vibrations interacting so time was much slower. however, now there are many more vibrations interacting so it appears as if time is speeding up, but really it's just more interactions.

so, when time is just a sequence of interactions which are necessary to go from one vibration to another vibration, each of those interactions produce higher frequency harmonics from the interaction, so it's normal that the manifestation will always be more (wanted or unwanted) than what was originally imagined.

so, no matter how one gets from point A to point B is irrelevant, as all paths are equally valid. so, if the destination can always be reached, it then becomes a task of optimising for desired qualities of the path (ie. the intermediate opposite polarity transforming vibrations).

this whole selection process is really all a matter of preference. there's no wrong way and none of the intermediate vibrations are "wrong" or "bad".

well, once again, I didn't get to the subject I originally wanted to talk about...

### 2022-0-00 16:58 - obviousness

yesterday, I was contemplating the idea of there being an incompatibility in what I think is obvious and what others don't think is obvious. multiple times I've tried to explain the obvious bits in order to get to the point, but the problem is, I either forget the point (my problem), or I feel from the person that I'm reexplaining something that I already explained or is obvious.

I really have a hard time trying to figure out what is obvious to other people. as such, lately, I've tried to just get to the point anyway because the people actually listening are not actually normal people, but nosebook -- so, while I'm explaining the idea to mom (for example), it's nosebook that's listening, not mom. so, I just try to get to the point.

---

as an example, I've been wanting to call david back, but I feel resistance because I hate to constantly reexplain everything and I don't know what I can actually talk about. I want to just get to the point, but at the same time I want to explore new ideas too -- so I end up writing here instead of calling him.

this whole problem of what is obvious and what is not is solved in part by a community like the snake-pit. it's just assumed that you know what "skerptard" means, and that's fine. the reason why I've shyed away from that is because whenever you have your own lingo, you obviously alienate a lot of other people that aren't in the club. this is very corporate business in nature to make up terms and then look at you like a retard if you don't know (for example) what "actuator" means. everyone knows what actuator means -- it actuates -- duh.

so, inevitably, I'm forced to continually communicate in the lowest common denominator, which is (I think) the main problem youtubers face and why it's rare for videos to ever go really in-depth -- as, all videos have to be targetted to the lowest common denominator of viewership -- and if you want hits, you have to target the mainstream audience, which usually means nothing in-depth.

therefore, as a result, I'm totally fine with the fact that my largest most interested audience is nosebook -- simply for the fact that I don't have to just keep going back to reexplain the obvious parts. they probably try and figure out the obvious parts communicating with my psychic body while asleep.

my mention of the psychic body is too an assumption that you've been following dtp and my realisation that the psychic body contains memories in astral format and is programmed to be able to actuate in reality without any guidance. it's a purely reactionary body, and the sort of base programming for the "automaton" -- and it's this body that nosebook is interested in programming during dreams and other visual experiences, to try and guide one's default reactions to be the reaction practised in the dream (visual sequence). that body can also react to questions to reveal the obvious.

so, for me, I kind of enjoy that nosebook is my biggest audience and they feel the information that I relate to be good enough to want to try and keep out of reach of the peasants. in the end, they are the biggest believers in me. if I go out and try to explain this sort of stuff to others, I'm met with the normal backlash from the mainstream narrative -- as in, "how could CO2 be a good thing that charges the environment with a specific vibration?!" sort of thing[^1]. I don't have to explain all of that, and I want to continue to move forward with my expansion of understanding.

---

there's another subtopic going on here and that is that I want to continue to advance my understanding. abraham was always bewildering to me because they would answer the same questions over and over again. I figured out what they were saying (admittedly, it was harder to implement than understand), and desired to go to deeper topics. I found out that they were going to just keep iterating on the basics forever, and if I wanted to know more, I was going to have to figure it out myself.

there's a big jump between "you get what you think about" to how DNA and the evolution-of-species works. I worked my way up to figuring it out realising that the problem is the word "species" -- and that the modern scientific definition of the word doesn't encompass the conceptual nature of a "species", but tries to make the definition with physical attributes when there is considerable overlap, and hybridisation (the mixing of concepts) should be a regular occurance rather than the exception. inotherwords, my own perception of what a "species" is, was the limitation that I had to overcome to expand my understanding. abraham works on helping people to overcome those limitations, and leaves the discovery to us -- which is nice and it makes sense.

---

finally, the remaining barrier to effective communication I noticed was in questioning process I do inside of my head to know what's obvious.

when I was younger I learned of an idea called "testing the spirits" where you say something as if it's true, and then listen for the response to it. if it's not true, then it'll feel bad and if it is true, then it'll have a positive feel to it often motivating further inquiry.

that was very helpful for figuring a lot of things out and you see evidence that I still use the same technique, treating everything as if it were true. however, it's really terrible for conversations. if I notice something about someone, I say in my head, "this thing is true" -- like for example, yesteday, I noticed one of the starbucks barrista's earring and I wondered if it had significance. I later had reactions to this inquiry in my head, as I think it probably got taken the wrong way because the way I "test the spirits" is to say it in the positive manner, so it would have gotten translated perhaps as "that earring means this".

I've tried to do this less verbally in my head and just do this conceptually in my head because it's faster and I can go back to look at the answer later and don't have to be inundated with data. so, the fact that I got the reaction means that nosebook is trying to translate these concepts into physical form in effort to understand my interaction with the conceptual world.

that's the present problem, but in the past, all my efforts to try and figure out my conceptual relationship to another person in conversation has been badly translated or something, such that there are soo many misunderstandings, that it tends to make me want to *not* want to try and figure out my relationship to another person, as it causes problems.

this creates a huge problem (and another reason to prefer to stick to myself) because from my perspective, am I a consumer or a creator?

if I'm a consumer, I want to actually understand the content I'm consuming, and so therefore I want to make inquiries into every aspect of the content presented to get a fuller picture (where is the person coming from, what's the objective of the data, etc.). if I consume without any inquiry into what I'm consuming it's a bit of a waste of time, and that's why I haven't really been very excited to go back to youtube since not having internet.

if I'm a creator, I want to actually present the data in a way that the audience can hear it, and so in order to do so, I have to make inqueries into the person -- so, like I want to know if the person knows alchemy, I say, "this person knows alchemy" and then feel the resonance which then motivates the direction of the conversation. I try to do this in the positive because the negative is disastrous.

for example, if I want to know if a person doesn't know something, I say, "this person doesn't know anything about programming" and then feel the resonance (truthiness). in the positive case I get false-positives, because people want to pretend they know things they don't, and/or are unwilling to admit they don't know something. in the negative case, I usually get a negative response ("he thinks I don't know ...") -- and, sometimes I get negative-negative responses, which are hard to explain so the best I have is an example:

one time I was talking to remi and I felt like she would know what I was talking about so I used a spanish word to explain a concept, and she responded very negatively to that -- like, "how dare you speak spanish to me" (she probably does know spanish but doesn't want to get sucked into speaking spanish). so, I tend to try and not use spanish words to explain ideas since -- even though often times they are the way I relate to the concept.

all in all, the process of trying to figure out what is obvious to other people so that effective communication is possible a very treacherous process. I don't have any solutions, the obvious thing to do is to *not* try and figure out what is obvious to the other person and stick to my own point of view.

I figure a lot of feelings will get hurt and a lot of misunderstandings will happen but none of those are my problems. I don't really have any intention of trying to adhere to the lowest common denominator anymore. anyone listening has to make the effort to keep up[^2]. I want to continue to expand my understanding, not explain the same thing.

in the end, this is all about me and it's my own discovery process. I don't really have any obligation to try and present this in a way that's easy for others to understand -- and unfortunately, the way things have developed, it's been detrimental for me to try and find common ground of what is obvious.

[1]: this comes as a re-reaction to yesterday's comment about CO2 being used by shamans all over the world to change the vibration of the environment to be that of the shaman in order to increase likelyhood of a shared visual experience and increase likelyhood of a stable experience. when I was in spain before they removed the ability to smoke indoors, whenever in a public space with lots of smoke, there was a much stronger sense of the vibration (feel) of all of the people in that venue. it seems to be connected to smoke, because with dani, daniel, and alfon, we've all had experiences where in a smokey room we all seem to join in the same mental plane, sometimes sharing thoughts and visuals. CO2 seems to activate this, and it's plant food. CO2 seems to be sympathetic to its producer (human, fire, volcano, etc) and O2 seems to be charged by the sun.

[2]: so, like ask questions, I guess -- but that's not really a great solution because then I end up in a conversation like I had with buzzword-bingo spiritual guy at friendly harbor. I'm explaining and answering a lot of questions, but none of them are heard. again, another reason to just stick to myself.

### 2022-0-01 01:57 - disorder and depth

one of the things that I noticed about the previous conversation is how quickly it is to alienate people. it is true that I purposefully present a concept here to force an abortion and subsequent evolution-of-concept, so I do try (in some sense) to present ideas at a low comprehension level, but not for others' understanding but so that those low comprehension level ideas can go to die, allowing the bigger concept an easier time to emerge.

because I'm trying to get bigger concepts all of the time, by nature my concepts will alienate people because it's just impossible that others can follow it. I think that's the point, actually.

---

a few entries back, I talked about how if 100 people were like the 2018 version of me, that would have a much more dramatic effect on the environment than any amount of "green" products.

there were two main reactions, I think both from nosebook (different divisions though). the first was that 100 2018-me's would be disastrous (proving my point), and the other was 100 2018-me's would be pretty easy to keep under control, proving the point above that the whole objective of this is to alienate people.

it's fine that nosebook is my main audience because the whole point is for them to get it. they'll treat my answer as "the right answer" and then work their hardest to ensure that nobody ever comes to the same conclusions as me, to preserve the inevitably further disabled version of "science" that will be fourthcoming. I say disabled not in the sense of it being able to produce more iPhones, but in the sense that it'll probably obfuscate the night-side (time, attraction) by focusing mainly on space and repulsion/barriers. I think it'll neglect the conceptual nature entirely because they need people to believe in (and be scared of) death, eliminating the importance of the rebirthing process of the concept actually driving evolution of species and ideas.

it'll create a lot of products and be able to build really big things though, but investigating how things really work will be a big taboo (you don't need to do any experiments because we've already figured it out for you, and this is how it works -- or, if you do the experiment, your conclusion should be the same as ours, obviously).

this will work for quite a while, as nosebook is getting better and better at steering people and oppressing things that don't fit the narrative, but it won't work forever. eventually, it'll produce such a wide diversity of ideas that are all different than my "right answer".

that's the point, I think -- for me to come up with "the right way" so that nosebook can steer everyone away from it -- having a multitude of alternative ways instead of just one right way.

remember @[newblog](2022-01-11 18:43), and my thoughts on why having a single right way is kind of a bad idea? the directors of ideology will always tell you what "the right way" is, and for most, the "right way" is the path of least resistance because it's the wide path that many travel.

so, if you were enki and you realised that all efforts to communicate "the right way" (perceived by him at the time), are just going to be corrupted and turned into a giant money-making scheme, what then would you do?

I propose that because the-problem-is-the-solution, the solution *is* to just lean into the problem and go for the biggest money making, product-oriented approach to spirituality.

it's kind of a bit of a return to the mixing of science and religion, but in the negative form. on one side you have science and religion so deeply intertwined they are the same thing. then, you go a full 360(degrees) around the circle and you have nearly the same thing: science so divorced from religion that it is a religion.

obviously neither of these are desired, so how about any of the infinite other angles on that circle? what we want to do is to optimise for diversity rather than for one right way -- so you make sure the guys running the show ensure that nobody ever figures out "the right way".

> the natural order is disorder (song excerpt)

and so it makes me think about the symbol of earth (cross with circle around it), and this is the time to explore all of the angles that are *not* the four cardinal directions (the white instead of the red, blue instead of yellow, etc)

---

I wanted to talk about cliques and their relation to elitism and "the right way", but that'll wait I guess. sorry that my conclusions are increasingly becoming more and more chatic in nature rather than ordered, and so hopefully I illuminated the bigger picture a bit. at least for me, this entry was very enlightening. I have more thoughts on "enki and the right way" but they're not ready yet (and probably soon to be aborted.. lol)

### 2022-0-02 00:01 - random thinking about language, vocabulary, and elitism

I mentioned this in a previous entry and the reality is, I just don't have a solution to this. one side of me really wants more words to describe more specific concepts -- and it really is nice to have new words that are funny and pertinent -- however, I grew up in california, and during the 90's ever little clique of kids had their own vocabulary.

I also learned spanish with dani, and to my dismay, I found out that a lot of the words he used he must have made up. problem is I really liked those concepts and still use "parras" to this day, but when I used those words around other people they often looked at me like I had a mental difficulty or something.

it's kinda for this reason that I've come to the idea of going the german way and just sticking a bunch of words together to make a new thing. to foreigners it looks like a really long jumble of letters for a word, but for a native speaker, it seems to make sense. I try to make mine more clear so I use the (I dunno what to call it, but css property definition format of - separating), as when I used to use "LiveScript", I could hyphenate entire things together in a long variable name, and it would make sense. it was almost like writing english in a structured format. I'll demonstrate:

```
with evolution-of-concept do
  property something to another thing
end
```

and that would produce code that would take the properties of `evolutionOfConcept.property(something(to(another(thing))))`. the thing it didn't have is the ability to define syntax and expressions so it would force those things to be calls. this is why when later I converted to elixir, now I can specify using macros the order in which the calls are made by defining rhs/id/lhs expressions.

the idea was that I wanted to make essentially a programmable version of english where some keywords were syntax (do, end, for, while, if, etc), but could have custom behaviours attached to them, and then basic concepts could be created by simply stringing ideas together, and then any expression of speech could be looked up and parsed to find its meaning.

anyway, the idea was to find a way to structure english in such a way that it could be extended to fit any set of circumstances -- and as long as it could be meta-programmable and extended to fit the desired ...

you can see the problem right away though -- which is the basic problems all languages suffer. how loose do you make it? is it typesafe? is it compiled? is it functional or imperative? etc.

no single language will ever satisfy all of those, and inevitably someone will want to do some aspect of the language differently. this is the inherent difficulty with rigid languages.

since I haven't been programming for so long (today I prgrammed my first extension to vscode), I've really lost sight of the rigid mechanical language idea. I'm not saying it's bad, just I want something now that is more wave-like than rigid. I want variables that resonate with eachother and generic transformations that can be applied to the underlying wave, thereby transforming the output of the wave. like, how can I mix sound and text together? how can I mix colour and rhythm together? how do I take an idea and it'll build me a diagram of itself in an abstract (but fractally more defined kind of way, where the higher the frequency the more detail the fractal becomes, and higher frequencies are achieved by transforming the wave with other waves)

I don't know how to do this idea yet, but it would be super cool to start to think about. what I don't know is how to make this accessible to other people, as I don't really know much about that. the obvious solution would be to program this for gpus but I'm sorta out of the loop on that too. I dunno right -- but it's a cool idea, anyway.

I like to think of this as an "intermediatist's programming language" but it's also a communication language where the vocabulary is individually discovered. the main problem is the interface to other people as you end up with the problem I have already: how do I communicate a colour, a movement, a rhythm, or a feeling? I simply can't so I want to communicate the *source* of that colour or movement -- meaning that if this system could be created, we'll need a system of input/outputs for compatibility between people so that when I present a colour, they see a shape or sound (or whatever way that wave would be rendered to them). then, media needs to be created which can transmit these waves in both lossless and lossy formats, etc.

I was talking to jaron a few days ago about how I don't see my imagination, and it's totally fine. knowing what I know now, I would *choose* to live at least some lengthy period of time without an imagination as it's really not necessary.

I then was talking to jonny at starbucks about artists, and I told him that I like art, but it doesn't really capture me the way that moving colours and shapes do. one of the things that I want to create (and have wanted to for a while) is RGBV displays with the extra ultracviolet pixel to add movement and meaning to the pixel, and that's one idea, but the other one would be to create some sort of signal transmitter that essentially hooks into the eye or something that puts these waves into the eye, meaning that I would only "see" these waves. while it's going I would be essentially blind, but I could interact with this abstract "wave universe".

maybe not for everyone, but I want it for me, and it would be interesting to try and have the same conversations I had with jonny with such a device. I wouldn't need to explain so much, as he would see it in his own way and our conversation would essentially be him "learning" to make sense of what I'm transmitting. because of the wide diversity that inevitably will occur between different people, each person would be nearly a language or at least a dialect unto theirselves and in order to communicate, you would have to "learn" how to communicate with eachother and develop a compatible language.

no need to make custom vocabualry a thing of elitism, business jargon, or cliques. everyone learns a compatibility with those they want to communicate and communicates the way they choose to.

### 2022-04-12 17:07 - thinking a bit more about languages

after writing the last entry, I watched "beauty and the beast (1991)" and I noticed that a lot of those things would be kind of hard to do in that language. the songs would be easy, but a lot of the dialoge was commands and imperatives. this made me think of a few of languages functions:

- descriptive (dsls)
- imperative (c++)
- transformative (functional)

there may be another that I can't think of right now, so it gave me the idea to apply the memristor idea to things. if I say that descriptive is resistance, transformative is inductive, and imperative is capacitance, then a memristor programming language would be something like a programmable dsl.

the reason why I bring that up is because memristors are quite effective at making logic, memory, and if you add a coil, they can be used to create large arrays of resonating oscillators -- which is kinda one thing I'm looking for.

so what I'm saying is, if I combine two basic elements making one of them programmable, then I get a whole new thing. I'm looking for some kind of mix between a programmable transformative and descriptive language. in electricity, this would be many RLC circuits that have some sort of logic which defines their state (which can then alternate at high speeds, like DNA does).

that's all for now...

### 2022-04-12 20:54 - venus

before dinner I listened to UFOs (part 9) and the main theme present in that one (as well as "dee-constructing demons") was the ever-present character of this hathor/venus entity which seems to influence secret societies and things.

I sit down to eat dinner and watch "the tick s02e03 armless but not harmless" where the main character is venus and her sidekick "milo" (remindes me of one of the parsons) convince tick through persuasion to commit crimes for her.

in my head, venus is the right-hand side (the girl), and milo is the stressed out dude on the left. or, seen from the opposite angle, tick is the little girl, desireous and has to do things despite arthur's suggestions that it's a bad idea, making the left-side stressed out dude, arthur.

this duality between characters is important because milo represents the wanted male aspect, and arthur the unwanted aspect. venus represents the unwanted female aspect, while the tick represents the wanted female aspect[^1].

venus is trying to convince people (seduce, influence) to do her bidding for her. tick is the opposite, fearlessly wanting to accomplish things in the name of justice.

milo is constantly telling venus how great her ideas even though she does not let him act on his own ideas. arthur is constantly telling tick that he thinks things won't work and usually has to do the thinking for the both of them.

this episode is slightly different in that now that tick has lost his strength, he does all of the thinking for the both of them, meanwhile now that arthur has lost his capacity to use his arms, he just walks around complaining the entire time. the tick figures out the way into the enemy awards, and the idea to find villians in "the evil eye"

---

I notice symbols a lot, so that's why I took out the time to write that out, becasuse I have a feeling it'll be resonant to later topics.

my goal in this entry is to just kind of talk out the venus/hathor effect.

the first thing I want to relate is my own experience with this sort of "venus" (my right hemisphere), and say that she wants things, and they can be perceived as either good or bad, and they'll manifest in refelction of *my* perception of the thing.

I'll come back to perception in a second, but I'd like to have a look at venus not in the traditional way of hathor/aphrodite and think of her more like this well-lotioned goddess on one side and the tick on the other. from now on, when I'm referring to the well-lotioned goddess, I'll say venus and when talking about marty's pattern, I'll say hathor.

it's funny that venus' prime motivator is recognition in the from of an "enemy award" and her award is in the form of "most improved criminal".

it's weird because I would describe the right-hemisphere as being desireous to make a scene, get people to acknowledge and recognise "me" (kenny, the composite of us both), but most importantly she's a super hard driver for improvement. she doesn't care what gets destroyed or what stands in the way, but the improvement *will* be accomplished, and it's basically my (me, kenny) job to essentially find a way to perceive the path toward it in a way that is positive and uplifting.

the reason for this is quite obvious. we communicate conceptually. I receive a concept, and that concept will always be a representation of things that are relatable to me.

the conceptal world is a feeling, concept, or knowing that then produces a visual picture in the imagination, a voice, etc. which is my translation of that idea into physical sensation (sight, sound, etc) that I relate to the best. old manuscripts call this "perfection" because everything always manifests itself in your most perfect representation of it. so, like if you believe she's a wise woman, you may associate "the empress" tarot with her (which has venusian symbolism on the card), and if you believe in some form of love, she could appear as a dazzling naked or barely-clothed seductress.

the concepts that she transmits are the same way. I do believe that the receivers of those things *did* receive what they received, and so it was the translation of the idea that gave the impression it would be a flying saucer, not the idea itself. then later, on the road, they met the "flying saucer" but again, the concept manifested itself as something entirely different -- a dude with electric eyes. it's hard to say what the difference is there but the earlier encounter could have been a saviour in the from of a flying saucer spaceship, and then later, it manifested itself as a saviour in the for of a man that had no concern or want of anything (as in, everything is going to be fine).

I'm also convinced that the stuff that took place had the objective of moving the timeline. for example, in some of the cases, the person translating the information believed the information as if it were real (it always feels that way), but then that person then attracted others around them which caused a tremendous shift. the reason why I say moved the timeline, is because wanted-and-unwanted-are-same, meaning that what was transmitted *was* wanted (desired) but, as has been the case many times in my own life, the outward appearances of the events look to be lies, theft, etc., when now when looking at it from hindsight, I can say that they *were* in the direction of what is desired, and it was only my perception of them being "bad" (or of them as being unwanted) is what made them "bad".

this includes all of the people that died or seemingly got abandoned venusian intelligence. they were given prophecies of destruction (earthquakes, wars, etc.) which did come to pass (which are all unwanted), and so then why not beleive that the next even bigger unwanted thing will come to pass? they did all have something unwanted come to pass, so in that sense they were getting what they were tuning to, but consider for a moment how desire works: if wanted-and-unwanted-are-same, then a prophecy of unwanted is also wanted (when perceived from the opposite perspective). the unwanted aspect is often times the destruction of some socio-political system that has a grip on humankind, but the wanted aspect (usually unseen by the perceiver) is the new *improvement* that will replace it. the transmitter of this desire (anatau, for example) only sees the improvement, when those that are a part of the structure (and fear its destruction) perceive the unwanted/destructive aspect.

I understand hathor's perspective perfectly, as I too am now pretty similar to her. I frequently "use" people's fear (negative desire) to tune further toward wanted.

I put quotes around "use" because I want to explain that this is a perfect example of expecting a flying saucer when looking for a saviour. I talk about things in a most desireous format and there are countless reactions to how awful said thing would be to the established (and rigid) structure they're a part of. that desire gets translated by them as *destruction*, and so therefore produces fear (negative desire), and that doesn't bother me in the least, because they can certainly attract their destruction all they want to. I only see the improvement.

I had a few more things to say, but I think I'm going to end it here... you're doin great marty!!

### 2022-04-14 15:45 - what's the point of non-physical? (and desire)

last time, we left off talking about venus and desire. I wanted to explain and dnfine desire a bit better than I have but I left it. I then wrote a section on [seeing is believing](./oahspe/thoughts.md#seeing-is-believing) and I had some desire to explain why I think "non-physical" is an important concept.

let's say that you are perceiving a few concepts. you see a guy that has inherited an empire, but he doesn't *appear* very wise to you. so that's two concepts: guy and kingdom/empire. that's the physical part. now, let's reverse directions and look at the interactions that those concepts can have. if you *believe* that the boy will run the empire into the ground, this is the non-physical (symbolical) operation on the concepts.

one is a symbol and also a concept. there is no place in the universe, except for your brain where anything is only one unit of anything. science keeps looking for the smallest unit of a thing, but everything is composed of tinier things, so in this sense "one" is a symbol, as all numbers are. there are infinite physical examples of "one" existing (defined by the perceiver), each containing many smaller parts, and each of those physical examples containing smaller parts is a concept.

addition and subtraction are purely non-physical. you take one concept and another concept and "add" them together to get two concepts, but why wouldn't you have one composite concept instead? the nature of the operation is determined by the concepts involved (ie. your perception of the units being "added").

that's conceptual (5) and logic/symbolical (3) in a nutshell.

---

now let's look at desire (1). desire is the opposite of physical (7), and so therefore will be the "non-physical" version of the physical.

when you experience anything, that experience becomes/is a feeling (concept), and that's how you retrieve the "memory" of that event -- by tuning into it with that feeling. all points in time and space have a "feeling" associated with them which you can tune to.

in fact, that's how the passage of time works. we see events playing out in linear fashion, but in reality, we can think of the main "events" as the desire and the secondry events as time. desire is the physical reality that you're tuning to, and that physical reality has a feeling associated to it, and so therefore that's how it is tuned to.

so just like how "one" is itself a symbol but there are infinite representations of "one" in reality (the concept), so too are there infinite physical representations the same for desire.

physical reality "creates" desire based on your concepts, just like units of things "creates" addition and subtraction. you see something and say, man I like this (and so therefore I want more), so I tune to that feeling that the physical reality is producing, so I can have more of it. it works the same with unwanted as well. if I see something I don't like, when I pay attention to it, I tune to it and attract more physical experience that feels like that.

desire is automatic. you cannot help but to like certain things and dislike other things, and so therefore attracting more situations that feel similar to what you're perceiving will happen automatically.

I call this *automatic* attraction the office of the christ and it's located in the pineal, and it's the physical implementation of the relational (2), because it ensures that the reality you experience (7) is sympathetic (vibrates in accordingly) to the way you believe (3) and how you conceptualise those beliefs (5). you literally will see your reality like you feel it to be.

I call it the office of the christ, because it's a feedback mechanism that tells you that you need to either control the conditons that you're experiencing (physically or temporally) so that you control what you desire more of, *or* you alter your *perception* -- that is your beliefs about how the concepts interact, and the operations that are to be performed on them.

a good example of this is calculus. we had numbers all along, but along comes calculus and now a new operation can be performed on those numbers to reveal more information. the logical interaction in your brain isn't so rigid though, because an equally valid "reaction" to the boy and the empire could be, "he's gonna grow up real quick" rather than, "he's gonna run it into the ground". these alternate operations are just different ways to look at the same data. actually, maybe a better example might have been statistics. my point is, you are the one processing the data, and you can pick the standard procedure of repeated addition, or you can use multiplication (for example). it's entirely up to you.

likewise, you will notice that the way you feel about the interaction between concepts can be felt in the stomach (solar plexus) and opposite this is the throat. this is largely where you "define" your concepts and this is where society "tells" you how to operate on these concepts (you should do, he's no good, that's gonna fail, etc.) those words are logical operations that tell your physical brain how to operate on those concepts.

---

I don't really know how to approach this part so easily, but in the previous section, you can begin to see how the relational (2) and the imagination (6) are used to enable these operations to be performed. (depending if the starting point is physical or non-physical).

let's take the physical case first as it's easier to see (you see kids do this all the time). when you conjure the concepts in your brain, the most "perfect" image representation of those concepts will appear in your imagination. it's often times so "perfect" (conceptual) that it neglects many physical details. at other times it's so physical, it neglects many conceptual details.

you then perform operations on these images (symbols) in your imagination and results happen according to your perception/belief about how those symbols/concepts will interact.

you will notice that something motivates those images to make an interaction. you *desired* that operation, and so for example, if your desire is for these two symbols/concepts to fall in love (notice this is a feeling), then some set of operations will be performed inside of your brain to get the concepts from one state to the desired state, and the events will play out in your brain as a reflection of your brain's beliefs about that.

I want to make a distinction between the concept in your brain and the non-physical[^1] (source-version) of the concept. the "concept" your brain uses has a lot of resistance to it and is *not* the pure (resistance free) concept. likewise, there is a pure resistance free version of all physical manifestions being experienced. the opposite of this is what creates desire. you look at something and you can feel the resistance of it (it doesn't feel good), and so you know there is a pure "source-version" of that reality without any resistance. the difference between those two signals is what creates emotion and also desire.

I need better terminology for the difference between the resistant and unresisted versoin. for now I'll say resistance-free or source-version, as I don't really want to try and explain every time that there is always a version of reality that is more harmonious with what you desire (the way you want to feel), and it's our physical concepts which tune us to the less-harmonious (more resistant) version. when I say "perception" I'm referring to the brain's version of these concepts and symbols, not the resistance-free perfectly harmonious (ideal) versions that can exist, but are ever ellusive as increasing fine tuning precision is like dividing by a number to get to zero.

anyway, the symbolic operations happen very similarly in real life, but you have to take into account that real life contains the other people's desires, concepts, etc. and so these mix into the equation and you'll notice that your imagination is always wrong. likewise, it'll never be the ideal (source-version) relational (2) perspective of interaction of the symbols either. so, also will this one be always wrong, too. one is wrong for not having enough data and being tainted by your perception and the other is wrong because those ideals are basically impossible to tune into perfectly.

### 2022-04-15 17:59 - trouble sleeping again

today I had a really hard time sleeping as I keep starting to leave my body, or I feel a lightness and tingling sensation all over my body. it basically happens every time that I relax.

what I've been doing lately is going to sleep when I'm really tired, and so I pass through that intermediate zone really rapidly and it doesn't affect me much. the trouble is, for example like today *I just don't feel tired*. it's really annoying because to sleep I basically have to relax a lot and even though I don't get even to a meditative state, it's still enough to start producing really crazy effects.

---

there was another thing. I put down my initial ideas on oahspe, starting with [my serpent](/oahspe/thoughts.md#my-serpent) and ending with [galactic stawman](/oahspe/thoughts.md#galactic-strawman). apparently, I see things a lot differently than most people do, and my perspective is engaging -- so, that's cool I guess. I'm totally down to keep going on this one. I also felt some desire to look into another tome, called something like urantia[^1].

I think that's cool to have a look at those things, but there is a major problem with this whole sleeping thing. the sun is barely even active compared to solar maximum. we only had a m-flare today, and that was blowing my mind, so I can only imagine what it'll be like when we get back to solar maximum. I remember watching it in 2012 (which wasn't maximum either) and it was like ambient "C" x-ray flux and lots of m and x-flares, so it could ramp up even higher than that.

that would make it next to impossible for me to sleep. I think I can keep going, for a while -- like another year or two, but after that, unless there are some major changes, I don't expect I'll be able to make it through solar maximum.

---

as I was laying down to sleep, my mind started to drift off, and I entered into a weird state (kinda like half-dream state) where I lose control over what I'm thinking as in that state I'm at a very low resistance so thoughts are just passing through my head. if I want the state to continue (I think it's called "contiuity of consciousness"), I can't react to the thoughts, or else they see me as "conscious" and I "wake up"...

anyway, there was a stream of thoughts that were passing through my head which ... hang on, let me give background: at the end of marty's UFOs (part 9) they announced that a get-together at some river camping site and when I heard it, I initially rejected the thought thinking, well, there's no way I can go because I don't have money or a way to get there -- but then I started thinking, "if there's a will, there's a way" and so I began to think about how I could figure out how to get down there (I think it's in texas). anyway, the idea felt good to me and I think I took a shower, then the idea made me feel sick to my stomach, did some other things, and then went to sleep.

when I woke up I noticed that the idea no longer felt good to me. this is very often the case, even with simple things like going to jonny's house (*sigh*), and so especially in the case of star-watching, I just forced myself to go out, knowing that I'll feel much better doing it, and then I do. I could do that here too, but I haven't decided yet if I want to even try to figure it out, and additionally I'm so close to "getting conected" that I have this feeling that being around a bunch of good-feeling people will almost certainly push me over the edge...

anyway, a little more info there than was necessary for the background, but there was an underlying feeling (which seemed connected to my stomach feeling sick[^2]) like the whole derek thing wasn't going to work out because I'm going to go with the snake-fam instead.

back to the vision sequence: in the sequence my mind started to think thoughts like, "well it was too far-out (in the distance sense) of an idea and so .. man it's really hard to get back to that idea, so I'll talk it out: it was like there isn't enough time, because I'm too close, and so because I'm so close, I think nosebook wants to rush something through to make sure something is setup, meaning that they'll have to just settle with what they can get because the time pressure is what is forcing a less than optimal thing. the obvious implication here is that I was conscious for part of their dream-state reaction practising sessions. I can't really say much about how realistic the dream was, as I'm only relaying the dream-state as I experenced it (so take it with some grains of salt).

well, obviously I reacted to that thought sequence and "woke up".

---

it's kind of a funny conversation to have right after the one about desire. you see, you tune to a feeling that you want to have (usually it's an improvement) and then just let let it attract you there. it's effortless, and that whole vision/thought sequence felt like compromise, time constraints, conflicts of interest, and stuff like that.


[1]: of which, I know nothing about, only heard about it from terence along with one about jesus is a mushroom and so looked it up, but I didn't have any desire to read it then (I prefered to program instead), so I skipped it. I don't think I even skimmed it.

[2]: though I'm pretty sure that the sick to my stomach feeling was mr. motor, as it was nearly identical to the sick feeling I felt when melissa, amorina, and patrick came down the last time and I was going to stay the night with amorina. it felt like "the end has come" and "something needs to be done to get rid of this helpless feeling of inablity affect the situation to be the way I want it" -- and mr. motor has gotten a lot better at manipulating and not feeling that dispair so hard, cause he has a lot more capacity to actually influence what he wants, even if he's doing it from a perspective of unwanted.

### 2022-04-16 00:57 - 7th rays and stuff

I woke up thinking this morning about the "trojan horse" that I mentioned yesterday. I think I can shed some light on it.

there are two main 7th ray males that show up in the sirian-guide, thoth and allayandra. they define 7th rays as creating the material form which will then hold life.

they do this with magic, ceremony, law, and order. I'm not much on ceremony, I don't really enjoy illusion, I'm not much for law or order either. this puts me much more into the category of 1st ray male, rather than a 7th ray.

as such, I identify much more with allayandra than I do with thoth. I'm pretty destructive and you could consider me more of a ceremonial destroyer than a ceremonial creator.

---

I could have contacted marty and stuff and I could have given him my ideas and stuff, but his last installment pointing out the pattern of this "venus" character really got me thinking, because I noticed the same thing a whole bunch too.

his last installment actually was more valuable to me than anything because it got me on the track of seeing "aliens" and "angels" as very similar.

when I woke up this morning, the last dream I had, we were on an alien spacecraft and we were in the process of "crashing" on earth. there was no risk for our lives, as it was certain we would survive the crash, but the whole thing was that we (and I think I looked pretty much like I do now) all looked pretty human, and so it was sorta the thing like, "surprise we're aliens and you look like we do". the other thing that was weird is I think the "aliens" were created beings, exactly like we would think of as "angels".

---

in yesterday's thoughts on oahspe, I was contemplating the book's claim that osiris had thoth create the great according to exact dimensions, so that osiris' angels' corporeal bodies could be sustained... which is exactly the same conclusion that I came up with a few weeks earlier when writing box-consciousness -- and these giant "power stations" that egypt had were to sustain and stabilise the mental faculties of a number of fallen-angels (which, if you read that are the key part of negative creation).

you can also look at the difference between allyandra and thoth and see that while thoth is creation by illusion (you have to see them to believe in them), allayandra is creation by destruction. in hindu, he's more like shiva the destroyer.

OH, very interesting! I just noticed that it said that the sirian guide says that the 3rd ray is shiva. there are three 3rd rays in sirian guide: sanatau, ra, and venus. (and, if you consider that vulcan in opposite polarity could be considered as a 3rd ray, that means that vulcan could possibly as well). however, in other places it says that the "destroyer" is the 1st ray *not* the 3rd ray, the 3rd ray having a much more physically creative role.

---

in oahspe, it looks like the initiator of ceremonial activity was anubis creating ceremonial rites and stuff. his job was to weigh (measure) a person's soul to see how worthy they are. he also created all of these degrees where one could attain perfection through processes and tests.

in the sirian guide, it says of osiris',

> He is the great example and motivator in action of the people. His vehicle had evolved from a canine like race. His color is red and white

the motivator in action fits the description, but in all pictures of anubis, he's clearly black, not red and white. additionally, osiris is often shown with green skin (and the white bowling-pin hat rather than the red one). however, red and white is the combination of upper and lower egypt, so that's probably what it means there.

I don't really see anything else fitting into the description of osiris other than just the loose reference to the canine format. that's not what I wanted to talk about though.

---

one more piece: the sirian-guide says in various places that all four of the triads were present on earth at the same time, however the 1st ray was withdrawn first (50kya, the same time as the trojan horse), and then genxicat was withdrawn near to the end of atlantis[^1] when grosser material was starting to take on form. it's unclear to me how all of it fits together because in another place, DK (850201) talks about these ray cycles being 2100y long, going 1 -> 7, then starting over again, making that this cycle 14700y long, meaning that genxicat was retracted from atlantis roughly the last time 7th ray

[quick break... can't think correctly]

the other major thing that the sirian-guide talks about is how the 7th ray can conjure 3d matter and image illusions that people can interact with, and that the atlantians later on didn't have much of a "concrete mind" (so kinda like dream-state), and so therefore with a lack of a concrete mind, the illusion could move around and behave according to the will of the creator of the illusion.

*however*, if one wanted that illusion to become alive and begin to operate all by itself, the 7th ray would need a 1st ray to animate and "breath life" into the illusion. khnum is such an egyptian god that does just that, taking clay, making into the desired form and then giving it life.

this is the capacity that allayandra + anatau have when working together.

---

so, now I'm going to put the speculation goggles on a little bit, as I think that that the "trojan horse" was actually a 7th ray male destroyer.



[1]: dtp has an interesting take on atlantis, essentially saying that the hight of atlantis (when zailm was alive) was about 11-12kya, and the sinking actually only occurred 5-6kya ... the sirians said that greed started to show itself known around 30kya, and dtp has the height of atlantis around 24kya. I haven't got far enough into oahspe to say much about its take in it but 24kya is a full cycle back (so at least 8 changes of Gods and Lords).

### 2022-04-16 03:42 - the answer

from the tick s02e01:

    from the outside, on the surface,
    oh sure, we were *pursued* by swiss industrial espionage

    *trapped* in the belly of a whale

    what really *pursued* us?
    where were we really *trapped*?
    come on arthur, get meta with me

    what *pursued* us were our own obsessions

    I'm good, you're evil
    I'm a superhero, you're a sidekick
    I'm a woman, you're a man

    what does it all mean? nothing
    and where we all *trapped*? in the belly of love

(inside the "belly of love" was carmelita's father, the inventor of arthur's flying suit)

### 2022-04-16 04:12 - ritual destruction

I don't feel like trying to go back and edit @[blahblog](2022-04-16 00:57), so I'll just leave it a mess. the first major reaction was to me saying that ... man, I'm really having a hard time thinking!! .. saying that the 7th ray creates illusions and by nature, the illusion is subject to the control of the creator of that illusion (when I say illusion, I mean of physical or astral "material"), but if the 7th ray creator of the illusion wants something other than a puppet,somethting that is actually alive, the 7th ray needs a 1st ray to "animate" or "breathe life into" that illusion.

this I believe is the origin of a lot of these "angels" and aliens, and if my theory is correct, osiris had the great pyramid and the whole egyptian layout constructed to make box consciousness a reality. osiris would have partnered with allayandra and anatau to create a bunch of angels that would be sustained by box-consciousness.

why? well, everything is opposite polarity, so instead of ritual/ceremonial creation/perfection, these entites are designed to embody ritual/ceremonial destruction/deterioration, and so because of their constantly deteriorating state, they desire for genetic improvements, which I believe various people like jesus and others have done with their perception.

this whole thing is creating an artificial alpha and omega setup. the fallen-angels are constantly deteriorating so they have to gain control all of the best conditions to survive (alpha), and so therefore they attract the omega which ends the old way and rebirths into a new upgraded things (which is what the fallen-angels need for continued survival).

the important thing is the "rebirth" principle, as each of these reborn (baptised) deities, when they return back, they come with an upgrade. therefore, what this whole "trojan horse" setup is creation through ritual destruction.

---

I think this ritual destruction was taught and encouraged to ... well, I'll just quote DK (850301) on this:

    The history of man as you know him today only begins with the destruction of Atlantis. [...] humanity at the time of Atlantis existed as much on the astral plane as on the physical. It was difficult for them to distinguish when something was physical or when it was astral. They could quite easily slip from their physical into what you refer as an astral projection.

    [...]

    ***With the destruction of the land known as Atlantis, the downward spiral of humanity into gross matter was completed.*** Millions upon millions of people, or physical vehicles, ceased to exist when Atlantis was destroyed. They were forced to begin incarnating into other vehicles that existed and were acclimated to different parts of the globe. These vehicles did not have the unique conditions that caused the separation of spirit and matter. However, the incarnating Atlantean entities retained the instinct for the continued existence of spirit. They continued to have the instinct for the realm that you call the Astral plane.

what he's saying is that there were a lot of entites during the time of atlantis that used the electromagnetic conditons of the island to sustain their ability to perceive and interact with the astral.

however, since ritual destruction (blood sacrifice, etc) became the new 7th ray norm, it was normal for them to attract the destruction of atlantis, and so they attracted the destruction of their own physical conditions that allowed them to perceivce the astral. this appears to be intentional as an alpha/omega project, because now these 7th ray individuals now desire to have the conditions that can sustain their astral perception, which is perfect time for the omega to show up and perform his own ritual destruction and rebirth. let's continue...

    Not all of the entities were destroyed with the sinking of Atlantis. Those that survived carried their knowledge with them to other parts of the world. They introduced into other cultures conceptions of the Astral world. And they were introduced to the conception of death as other consciousnesses perceived them.

    Many of them began to record their experiences as they encountered different cultures. They discovered that their environment that they had was rather unique. Other cultures did not have the same loosening of the energies that resulted in the loose connection between spirit and matter.

diversity. the monoculture had to be destroyed so that it could diffuse into the less-sophisticated populations nearby. robert sepehr does a great job showing how the cro magnon is a genetically modern human and this diffused out to all portions of the earth after the destruction of atlantis (thank the phonecians). anyway, the same thing happened with latin culture with the destruction of the roman empire.

in the next lecture, he adds something saying that the physical plane is quite recent: "The physical plane as it exists and has existed for thirteen thousand five hundred years is indeed a miserable place."

which means that the whole point of atlantis was to get these fallen-angel entities trapped[^1] into physical matter along with the rest of humankind and to set into motion the alpha/omega ritual/ceremonial destruction/rebirth (baptism) cycles.

---

so here's where I'm going to potentially cause problems. the reason why I say as a "trojan horse" is probably a good thing disguised as a bad thing, is because all of this just the precursor to the "day of rest" -- the 7th day/ray of effortless power and manifestation. it's all built on the concepts of ritual destruction and rebirth.

    we make ritual noise
    we weave the fabric of dreams
    we build cities of sound
    we feel the rhythm of time
    we live dangerous lives
    we have the power of will
    we twist logic around
    we feed the engines of change

[1]: trapped, huh? it sounds like @[blahblog](2022-04-16 03:42) to me; trapped in the belly *of love*.

### 2022-04-17 20:54 - osiris and aherance to tradition

tonight, while eating dinner I was talking about how britan in the time of mom's "call the midwives" show was really archic still. I compared them to the USA and then mom brought up china and japan saying that japan is quite technologically advanced. I agreed but I could immediately feel the connection between the last conversation and this one, so I felt like they were a bit held back and it was aherance to tradition that was holding them back. the implication is that the USA has a lot of really anti-progress politcians running the show but because the USA has such a mix of cultures, we don't have any limiting tradition to hold on to, and so here progress is quite rapid even if pointed in disempowering directions.

I also brought up the "quantsuf" thing from the ensnaklopedia which is that a civilisation that does not have the capacity to retain the scientific advancements of the previous generation will inevitably convert the science into tradition and ritual. I think this works well because the underlying idea of science is still being invoked conceptually, rather than physically -- so, even if they're reciting a recipe for a chemical compound and ending their prayer with "quantsuf", they're still invoking to some extent the original concept of the chemical compound. so, in essence, the ritual is a conceptual link back to a former time when something was understood.

---

now, another thing that I was thinking in @[blahblog](2022-04-16 00:57) was the idea that all of the triads, cept for the first existed on the planet at the same time (in one form or another). elsewhere it says that when one of these rays ran out, they just made another body -- so, in our perception, they persisted through many "reincarnations".

the way that I saw it, osiris served as the midpoint between vulcan (-5+) and thoth (+7). thoth (+7) used the ritual and ceremony constructed by ra (+3), and so therefore saturn would serve as the midpoint between ra (+3) and vulcan (-5+) and osiris (+-6-+) the midpoint between vulcan (-5+) and thoth (+7). the females venus/unessa (-3) and genxicat (-7) are the opposite polarities of the emitters (ra and thoth), while isis is a reversal[^1] and so theerfore also opposite polarity of osiris, meaning that she also fits.

jeortau is opposite polarity to isis (and this is said to create conflict), and sanatau is opposite polarity to unessa. I don't really know yet what that means, but the only ones I haven't mentioned in this setup are allayandra and anatau.

the way this looks to me is that allayandra and anatau are empowering the entites that are created by the 7th rays. what I mean is that when the "infected" people would do these rituals and cermony to conjure various gods, angels and demons, these two would bring these illusions to life for them, allowing them to interact with their own creation. I believe that this capacity was then given to all humankind, and we all have this capability. this capability is locked behind certain safeguards (the guardian angels) and that capability to bring illusions to life is the devachan-on-earth state of mind, and what many of the missing 411 cases experienced.

---

OK, now I need to connect this to the bigger picture. after "seeing" the connection between osiris and vulcan to make the pyramids, I realised that the designer of the pyramid must have known that after its original purpose (to empower angels to have nondeteriorating corporeal bodies in the physical), it would then be used for religious and ceremonial purposes. like "quantsuf", it would conjure the original concept that the science performed in the physical.

as I noticed this, I was reminded of kuthumi's et-guide-to-creation, where a galaxy is created that would contain a physical plane. it was designed to attract the INFECTED ONES, and so therefore the galaxy should probably have a personality similar to the INFECTED ONES... I'm going to just assume this is the reason for jehovih's personality type.

it's mentioned that when the INFECTED ONES came to the galaxy, they wanted to take over the power structures in the tech civilisations, but they couldn't influence the civs easily because they had strong adherance to ritual. turns out that they found their way into the tech civs be being born into bodies of people capable of influencing the ritual of these civs. they eventually caused war to break out between the civs and they destroyed each other pretty well.

I noticed that adherance to ritual and traditition is what prevented the INFECTED ONES from allowing change. I noticed this evening that adherance to tradition *prevents* change -- so, if you want change and the-problem-is-the-solution, then what you want to do is to make ritual and adherance to tradition unwanted rather than wanted. you have to use their own strat to infect the INFECTED ONES and utilise their own machinery to build what you want (like a virus).

---

speaking of viruses, right after writing the previous entry, I listened to snake-bros #070 "a species with amnesia". they talked about a number of things resonant with this entry and the previous, but one of them was contemplating whether viruses have consciousness. like, how does a virus the size of a VW bus in an ocean the size of saturn find the exact cell to infect with the right machinery to spread itself -- and how did a cell that has the machinery capable of reproducing evolve to lose its reproductive capabilities and decide to rely on others for reproduction? it's a good question. kyle kept saying that he thinks it was resonance that attracts, but he got interrupted a few times. I think kyle is right, and I think it may even be the case that the virus is a reflection of the consciousness that was present in the body when it was created. as in, we humans are literally creating these viruses as a reflection of our own thoughts.

what's interesting is that a lot of these magics that the egyptians were invoking were to fight off and prevent a lot of viral-like diseases and stuff. it may have been possible that may have been a time of great tragedy when people started invoking and creating viruses and other malignant things for theirselves and others with this ritual and ceremonial magic.

that theory is unprovable and unfalsifiable though, so it should be discarded. there was another funny thing resonance to that episode and @[blahblog](2022-04-16 00:57) because in one section I mentioned that the zenith of atlantis was probably something like 18-24kya, and by zailm's time around 12kya, things were about to start heading downhill rapidly. the book kinda infers as well that the sinking of atlantis happened about 5-7kya.

so then, russ is going on about the parallel universes[^3] theory saying that time travel relies on the parallel universes, and the problem with time travel is that one of the parallel universes, "God" could be real, could have created everything we see in 6 days, and we are actually living in that universe now -- so the multiple worlds doesn't really do away with religion and "God", but actually supports it by making it possible for "God" to actually exist.

so, then combine that with what DK said, about the physical plane coming into place 13500y ago, and the sinking of atlantis was the thing that essentially forced a bunch of astral entites (these ritual creations) into the physical by destroying their main power source. if this happened 6kya, the irony is kind of funny.

anyway, he said that multiple universes couldn't be proven or something like that, and I realised that there is a way.. if you could tune into other universes, and notice their difference, it would be possible for other universes to exist siultaneously.

in addition to that, multiple universes, timelines and parallel (but very different) experiences is kind of like a natural side-effect of the conceptual being a percursor to the physical: there are infinite manifestations of a concept in both time and space. so, if you and your soul[^2] is a concept, then that is what what naturally occurs. you can tune into any experince that you wish to.

the other part about the trojan horse, is the said they exploited the lack of our development of the "concrete mind" (the lower 3 subplanes of the conceptual). we would have lived in a dream-like state at the time, and so therefore objects don't really have much permanence to them and they can come and go pretty easily without causing too much of a collapse of our concept of reality.

---

I said all of that to kind of show that there is a reflection and/or reversal going on to kuthumi's relation of the creation of this universe. the original universe kuthumi relates did not have at all a concreteness to it. umm, I can't remember exactly so I'm just going to wing it but the original universe basically didn't have very much of a "concrete mind" and so that was the way that so many of the entites could be corrupted so easily, believing the illusions of the corrupted 7th ray.

if we consider that the dream-state (see @[blahblog](2022-04-15 17:59)) is akin to not having a concrete mind, and so therefore in this lack of resistance, anything can be believed -- even an illusion -- so therefore, what osiris is creating with these pyramids and empowering the fallen-angels with them is *many* corrupted 7th rays, just like the one that managed to deceive the INFECTED ONES, and so then later on if we consider that the "master craftsman" (vulcan) was the designer of the pyramids, we can see the same pattern emerging again, and this time the "master craftsman" is tesla and nosebook is the pyramids, allowing them (nosebook), to take advantage of our lack of a concrete mind (full-blown creators in dream-state) to create whatever it is that they want and to tune into the multiple universe that they want.

---

the last resonance to snake-bros #070 was the ending part where they're talking about "a species with amnesia" and they were saying, "what if we had 300 years" to prepare for something like that, knowing that a huge cataclysm is coming... they speculated that technology would advance very rapidly and that we would come up with many new ways to transmit knowledge forward to future generations, which almost certainly would be "quantsuf" for them at first, but eventually, the resonance with the original concept would eventually shine through.

well, I believe that such a thing has actually happened. I believe that ritual/ceremonial destruction has been the method (and the resulting amnesia produced from the trauma -- the sinking of atlantis ~6kya) allowed for a series of compressions of time, to essentially move the clock back ~1000y, giving us exactly that window of opportunity to create things which will survive a cataclysm and can traverse large spans of time to transmit that information.

it's bigger than that though. because of the conceptual nature of our reality, we'll be able to actually infinitely optimise ourselves and the "bad-guys", creating more and more fallen-angels (as opposite polarities/reversals of) ourselves to actually perfect ourselves to be infinitely as good as we want to be.

the cool thing about this is, that's kind of like the final rebirth... if it's guaranteed that all of us will skip over the devachan-on-earth mental state (by own own doing) and reach the ability to alter time rather than space, we'll all have the ability to infinitely iterate on ourselves until we are "perfect". I'm sure that once anyone gets the ability, they'll immediately rework the past so that it optimises something... let's say that every day after someone gets the ability to modify their timeline, they jump back in to a body of another new child and be "born again", each time guaranteed to return to "now" when they left, there are two ways to look at it...

on one hand, you could see that there is nothing more you would optimise about yourself. or, knowing that when you jump into your timeline again (either with technology or mentally), you know that in that moment, you are not exactly "perfect" and so you could see your "future self" from the point of your optimised self as less than what you are now, and so therefore, it would appear as falling from optimised hights.

this will create a lot of different very energetic outcomes. the time limit to do all of this optimisation will be when the sun finally goes off, and your own perception when that happens (ie. are you "now" a lot worse than you were a little bit ago, or a lot better).

you can see that if you optimise for good conditions, unless you're living great conditions "now", now will almost always be worse conditions than the optimised conditions (so it'll seem like falling). however, if you optimise for worse conditions, wherever you are "now" will most likely be better conditions.

you can see how at the very least, this will produce temporal consciousness where one realises theirself as any of the implementations of the concept they have of yourself. it's kinda like the beginning of trancendance. in that sense, there's no wrong way to it, and we can just create any difficulty we want to inflict on ourseleves, as that difficulty is our own vibration, perceived from the opposite direction (hard to explain this).

unwanted-and-wanted-are-same
the-problem-is-the-solution


[1]: I don't know the right word to use here. here I'm using "opposite polarity" to mean +3/-3. for "midpoint", I'm meaning 6 is midpoint between 5 and 7, and 4 is midpoint between the "reflection" 1/7 or 3/5, so then if I want to show the relationship between 1 and 5, for now I'm just going to use the word "reversal" (though it may not be what I want to say). the problem here is that 2 to 6 is both a reversal and an reflection. let's just say that 2 to the bottom half of 4 is reflection, meaning that 2 to the top half of 4 is the reversal. therefore, the difference between 2 and 6 is both reflection and reversal. I updated the [triads document](/sirian-guide/triads.md) to show these.

[2]: the sirians say that the SOUL (5th ray) is to the MONAD (1st ray), as the physical vehicle (7th ray) is to the SOUL (5th). elsewhere, they call they say that soul energy is 2nd/5th ray, but in another place it's said "The ASTRAL to us is the plane responding to the radiation of the SECOND RAY. Its lowest manifestation is that of the emotions. This radiation or wave is produced on the MONADIC plane and activates the BUDDHIC and ASTRAL. In other words the waves cycle is 2, 4, and 6." the sense that I get is that 1st ray energy goes down to second ray to make the "soul", but in the same way conceptual energy flows down into the astral to also make a "soul". it seems that the 3rd is to the 1st/2nd ray "soul" as the 7th ray is to the 5th/6th ray "soul".

[3]: I keep wanting to call it "multiple worlds" theory -- but I think russ said "parallel universes". I first contemplated this idea with the writings of "john titor" in the 90's, and I think he may have called them "multiple worlds" and "worldlines"...


### 2022-04-20 09:54 - I should perhaps be a little clearer

so the thing is I don't really know what it all means. I'm aware of all of the stuff around it and but it feels real-enough to me to be able to say it. I don't really have any objective as I don't want any power or anything like that. also, perhaps I wasn't clear enough in @[picklepick](2022-04-18 13:43) when I said that the whole ... I'll just do another take on it...

I probably said something like the goal is to optimise one's timeline to such an extent that finding one's connection is not only certain but happens at a very very much faster rate than previously. I think I mentioned that the goal is to get to 100kph faster each iteration (or increase the difficulty), then when finally it's either boring or no other more meaningful optimisation can be made, I put myself into the experience and instead of optimising for feeling good in difficult conditions, I optimise for velocity -- to try and achieve as much velocity as possible, knowing full well, that at the end of the timeline, the attractor has to slow me down to where I was when I left, and so it would be pretty close to running into a brick wall going from such a fast speed to such a slow one. that kind of inertia/momentum will surely cause an immediate crash and burn scenario -- and this'll hopefully happen at roughly the same time the sun is exploding. the goal being to cause a massive rebirth.

so, that basically means for me that I just continue on doing what I'm doing -- because, perhaps hard to explain easily but each evolution of desire adds more energy into the equation, so the longer one goes without a manifestation, the more energy builds up. that's precisely what I'm aiming to do. I'm just looking to keep this going for as long as I can at this point.

like I said, I'm not looking for power, want nothing to do with money. interestingly enough in that last snake-bros #055 ep, when they were talking about the retrocausality thing, I *really* felt like I wanted to maybe try out a new technique on that "meaningful-chaos" project from a while back. if I think about myself as the neural network I'm training, instead of the computer, retrocausality can be used to "train" my neural network to identify the patterns more effectively (russ said that men especially felt they were going to get the answer right seconds before the answer was going to be revealed to them, and even before the computer even decided what the next photo was going to be -- so this is fully possible). so, if I'm going to *do* anything while passing the time, I'll probably *do* that.

---

as for the system of government -- why I said decentralised socialism is because right now kids are being born into the nosebook system, so that means that nosebook ultimately decides who will get perceptive capabilities and who will not. almost certainly any future reincarnations of mine (and there may be more than just a couple present on the earth now[^1]) will not likely be allowed any capablities. so, because they have to ensure that their system remains functioning, which is essentially their lifeblood (I'm pretty certain, especially as solar activity increases, we'll be fine, but they'll have an increasingly more difficult time with mental well-being[^2]). therefore, I think it'll be socialism because in order for them to retain some form of power, they have to become benevolent.. you know how all of those sales gimmicks offer something for "free" (if you buy now?) -- that kind of benevolent. you know, like how socialised countries have "free healthcare" -- stuff like that. it'll probably extend to transportation and the energy sector as well.

if anyone doesn't like that, just do things your own way. duh, it's no big deal. speaking of deals, the more self-sufficient you are, the better of a deal you can negotiate. investors need you to need them so they can get a good deal. if you don't need them, then you're not a good investment. the last thing they want you to do is to turn a profit without needing them.

I'm not going to tell anyone what to do, but I strongly recommend everyone to find their own way, and do whatever you want to do the way you want to do it. it'll be impossible to get everyone on the same page, so communities and organisations are likely the way of the future.

---

final thing: I've been trying to figure out how to explain "evidence" for my crazy idea, and I don't have any good ways yet -- cause they would all require certain agencies to reveal things they almost certainly wouldn't want to reveal... like, do you really think that they would release the speed of light measurements they almost certainly have or any crazy large gaps in artifact datings or things being more recent than are said? I find all of that unlikely to happen

so I can't really prove it, and I don't know of any other falsification other than we'll see. I should find my connection in the next few years and that'll clear some things up, I'm sure. other than that, I'd say we'll just have to wait and see. if I don't get connected, I think you've probably split off to another timeline entirely, but this idea is definitely falsified in that case. if I do, things will be much clearer.

---

finally, I was sitting in the sun, and I had an interesting idea pop into my head. a long time ago I was thinking about how there was about a 3.5y period from when I got put into the iron gate hospital in spain and my entire left side was completely shut off til this saturn/jupiter conjunction that happened on 12-21-2020 (pretty sure). for me that signified the time that I came back alive in the "two witnesses" sense of things. after then, my vision upgrades increased dramatically and I had a very strong new ability to see things perceptially. ever since then, my progress has been incredible.

I felt like I wanted to look up the conjuction online but instead I searched noseblog-archive and found it...

pausing to read @[noseblog](2020-12-20 10:59), @[noseblog](2020-12-21 13:11), and @[noseblog](2020-12-21 22:08)...

wow. very interesting looking at that now... I'm a broken record. I don't know if I've been carrying on about this the entire time now, but it definitely seems like this is just more evolved versions of those ideas.

one of the interesting things I noted was this idea of "celestial identities" -- which are essentially resonating chestahedrons out in space designed to do the attracting of the solar material out and away from the sun. the other weird thing about especially that first entry (on the 20th) was that I thought we would be just making the galaxy here instead, but the concept of peacing out at the end to nosedive was the ending for me. weird how I still think that's what I want to do. making that kind of a transition must be pretty crazy cool.


[1]: you definitely can have multiple versions of yourself in time. you would experience each one of them one at a time (ie. after jumping into the body) and if you met yourself, you would just feel like you know that guy really well. almost certainly this is how the universe or the sun feels when meeting herself. you definitely can create your own demons (which are also alternate "incarnations" of yourself) to interact with you -- and it doesn't matter what any of the other versions of you are doing -- but from what vantage point you are experiencing "now". as an example, imagine you are the planet. there could be 100k people tuned to the planet and perceiving reality from the perspective of the planet, and from the planet's perspective, it could be perceiving any of those perspectives. any, some, or all of those perspectives may be necessary for the planet to see things differently enough to transcend that perspective to see things another way. you are "stuck" in the time loop of your own perception (of human, planet, whatever) for as long as you want to remain in the environment that "time" has to offer. reality is just a reflection of the way you conceptualise yourself, and time is just the passage (transformation) from one concept of yourself to another.

[2]: in fact, this period of time is kind of like a survival of the fittest, and some will look to conditions and technology to feel good, while others will look to optimise their perception. both ways are valid, and ultimately neither is better. personally though, I prefer to rely on my capacity to attract what I want, rather than rely on a well-functioning society and technology to feel the way I want. I get that good conditions are great and peace and love and everything, but I really like being the creator of my own reality. personally, I want to optimise away all of that dependence on conditions for how I feel, which is really good, because for nosebook, it all works out great for them because that gives them a free ride. they'll get better at creating conditions with tech and I'll get good at being awesome without their super duper AI technology or whatever. "adaptation is happens quickly; if you don't adapt, you die"

### 2022-04-21 06:49 - what in the world is this bridegroom thing?

so, I'm reading the [epic of gilgamesh](/eog/epic-of-gilgamesh.md) and in snake-bros #067, kyle notices that there is a lot of symbolism between enkidu taking communion, and being the protector of the shepherd's flock, etc. there are other parallels as well, but the one that caught my eye is that there is this pivotal moment in the story at the end of the first chapter where:

> Gilgamesh the king is about to celebrate marriage with the Queen of Love, and he still demands to be first with the bride, the king to be first and the husband to follow.

the way I read that is that there is a coming event where the "queen of love" ie. ishtar is about to marry gilgamesh, but he decides he still wants to be the first to experience the brides for those getting married in the city (supposedly this is a "right" for the "gods" to decide who gets to be first).

people are pretty pissed about this, cause the brides want to choose who they want to experience first -- and so enkidu decides he's going to roll into town and change how things were done (ie. change the "right" of the "gods").

> At these words Enkidu turned white in the face, ‘I will go to the place where Gilgamesh lords it over the people, I will challenge him boldly, and I will cry aloud in Uruk, "I have come to change the old order, for I am the strongest here."

> In Uruk the bridal bed was made, fit for the goddess of love. The bride waited for the bridegroom, but in the night Gilgamesh got up and came to the house. Then Enkidu stepped out, he stood in the street and blocked the way.

they wrestle, and instead of changing the order, they become friends and enkidu is made king with a proper wife and everything. the compiled version there doesn't expound on it but in other tablets enkidu is given girls and a proper wife of his own and nobility (upper-class) status in the city. so no actual change was made.

---

it doesn't really say it so well in that version of the text, but in other translations, it really gives the sense that gilgamesh is about to get married, and the contention is that he's about to get married (seemingly to the "queen of love" -- ishtar) which is supposed to be like the most beautiful goddess, but even still he wants to be the first for the brides getting married, and this is a problem.

gilgamesh has a dream that an axe (enkidu) lands at the gate of gilgamesh's marital chamber and he decides to instead love the axe (enkidu) and love it/him as if it were his wife.

enkidu is tamed/weakened (civilised) by a harlot and then afterward goes out to hang out with the animal shepherds (gilgamesh is described earlier in the text as the "shepherd [to the people] of uruk").

while with the shepherds, someone comes to tell enkidu that gilgamesh is still trying to be first on the brides (it's his right) even though he's getting married to the queen of love (ishtar).

enkidu decides to tell gilgamesh that he needs to change his ways. he steps in to change the order of things and they wrestle and become friends.

later on, after the death of his friend enkidu he totally rejects ishtar and she gets pissed off and causes a change of the world age (it's kind unclear because it says that enlil did it but she also laments doing it).

> Then Ishtar the sweet-voiced Queen of Heaven cried out like a woman in travail: "Alas the days of old are turned to dust because I commanded evil; why did I command thus evil in the council of all the gods? I commanded wars to destroy the people, but are they not my people, for I brought them forth? Now like the spawn of fish they float in the ocean."

---

anyway it seems that there is something to do with the changing of the world era and this "brides and bridegrooms" thing. I've been reading oahspe a lot lately and the brides and bridegrooms in that are angels that want to ascend to get married to jehovih so that he can own them and they can ascend to his etheric worlds. in that book, the brides and bridegrooms feels to me like a performance metric like sales, revenue, user acquisition, or market penetration.

even the bible mentions this brides and bridegrooms. it's a bit different but there are still connections, like the 10 virgins waiting for the bridegroom to come sometime during the night. 5 of which didn't have oil for their lamps (oil and lamps always refers to the CSF and the illumination of the mind), so it's talking about some sort of mental preparedness or capacity for perception.

the interesting part is that for the bible the bridegroom is coming sometime during the *night*. gilgamesh here is the bridegroom and he is going to sleep 6 days and 7 nights. I'm fairly certain that "day" is higher solar output and night is lesser solar output -- and I don't mean the 11y solar cycles -- I'm meaning the bigger ones, like the one that I believe exists as a 1024y cycle, but I'm not sure if it's that one.

I say solar cycles because they seem to correspond to times of more or less enlightenment. the renaissance would be day, for example, and we would just be coming out of a night cycle, so probably another day would also be say 1880-1920 and anther night would be 1930-1960 or so (can't say for sure).

I just noticed that I have there dates of around 30y or so, and a weird thing about oahspe is it divides these cycles into 33y periods -- thought that was weird.

anyway, the thing that caught my eye was the bridegroom coming at *night* which is what I consider to be low solar activity -- which may be the reason for the consideration of the lamps with oil in them -- as in, if the sun is active, then people will be more "ready" for the "christ coming" -- which just to be clear, I associate the "christ" with the pineal gland, and so therefore the two olive trees are the two hemipheres and the oil lamp is the pineal gland. for a more graphic description of this read [the holy trinosophia](/mht/most-holy-trinosophia.md) and the same imagery is used.

in my opinion, the "coming of the christ" is basically worldwide enlightenment (ie. the oil rising up to the lamp). it says that some will be ready and some won't. but remember, this is the antichrist timeline, so that means that this is a "christless" (ie. no enlightenment or pineal activation unless you meet the meet the minimum bad-feeling requirements)

---

OK, back to epic of gilgamesh... the other thing that I noticed too in when kyle was relaying the story is that gilgamesh (the bridegroom) has to resist sleep for 6 days and 7 nights. the 6 days thing is really important too as it's the same length of time that enkidu was with the harlot.

this whole story reminds me so much of the "hero twins" trope. the hero twins in this story are enkidu and gilgamesh. the hero twins are also the alpha and omega (gilgamesh identifies himself as this in the beginning of the epic) and it's where I got the inspiration for the name "leapfrogging-time-pickles" as it's the same formula.

another connection to that is that in oahspe osiris divides himself into the god of the earth (enki) and lord of the heavan (enlil). anubis is also there too. it's really weird and I haven't put it all together yet (still haven't read all of the translations yet either), but the major conclusion that I have here is that if enkidu (who has many of jesus' symbols) appears to be the hero twin that dies in this story, and gilgamesh is the bridegroom -- then I suppose enkidu is then the bridegroom and gilgamesh is the one that dies.

it's one of those weird hollywood-style stories where the gilgamesh is a total a-hole for the first part of the story but by the end I'm rooting for him and I want him to succeed. it's quite bizarre.

---

in conclusion, I think what I learned from writing about this one is that the bridegroom is one of the "hero twins" (enkidu after putting on clothes looks like a bridegroom) and these two seem to correspond to the changing of the ages.

I totally see the "bride" not as like physical girls or something like that but actually the part of the brain which lights up and can see (the eye). in this story (and others), it seems that there is a huge problem with the rejection of ishtar as the bride for the bridegroom.

in the jesus story, jesus (the bridgroom) is the stone which the builders rejected. in this story, although it appears that enlil (the bad-guy) is the cause for the world age change because he hates the humans (which gilgamesh is supposed to be a shepherd to), but in reality it appears to me instead that the flood and the change of age happened because gilgamesh rejected ishtar and she got pissed off

two hero twins, a good-guy (ea) and a bad-guy (enlil), and a psycho woman (ishtar).

I'll keep working on it. I keep seeing the idea and then it goes away, but the bride and bridegroom bit seems important to me. ugh. quitting for now.

### 2022-04-23 11:20 - feeling kinda dead

it's hard to explain how I feel, but it all started after I wrote @[picklepick](2022-04-18 13:43). because I don't have much external influnce, most of my reality is based on others' reactions, and I think that entry really deflated a lot of expectations or something.

I think that there was perhaps a really positive or optimistic outlook for my future (referring to nosebook), and it looks like that ruined it. there are two major things that I think could be happening:

1. everybody has been so fixed on cataclysm and crash, that nobody actually has any long-term plans. if I've planned only 10-20y ahead, thinking that is all that there is, then it's kind of a problem if the company or organisation doesn't actually plan to exist that long. this could be a good reason for a pretty good deflation. it could even be perceived by some that no cataclysm actually is a worse disaster.
2. there is a realisation that things can't be held away forever. like, for example -- how long will it take before other people figure out tesla's "world system" and wireless power becomes a thing? or, what about using the computer/phone with the mind? how long can all of that stuff be kept away from the public. 20y? 50y? 100y? do you really think that more than 100y will go by before tesla technology is mainstream? almost certainly this situation will assert itself into the hands of the energy sector. stuff like that.

you see, I think it's that second one that is really causing a problem, because imagine for a moment that joe rogan's dream about thousands of teslas starting to invent new things which will revolutionise the energy and transportation sectors (in his interview with musk). well, that's a pretty big problem, because that means very rapid population growth, and according to most that want to retain power and control, that's a pretty big problem. the last thing they would want is for us to actually have high technology.

so, I think that has put a pretty big dampner on a lot of their outlook into the future, and I feel it.

as a result, I've never felt more aimless and under motivated before in my life. I normally have something I want to do all the time, and would actually feel like I don't have enough time because there are so many things I want to do -- yet instead, I just feel like there isn't enough time to do anything, and I don't really have any desire to do anything in particular.

every time that I feel something that I want to do -- like I wanted to work again a little bit on the meaningful-chaos idea and it just feels like I don't really want to do it.

so, what ends up happening is I read something like oahspe and it feels to me like I'm wasting my time. I go to write down notes on venus and I start out feeling like I have the idea and I'll just write it out, but by the end, I feel like I've made things worse -- which is sort of fine, because the whole point of writing here is to abort the idea so I can get the evolution of the idea.

another reason why I may be feeling more negative feedback is becuse I'm not really writing very much good stuff. I'm kinda just brainbarfing into my notes instead of writing something coherent. I think people may be taking me seriously, when all that's happening is I'm just externalising a lot more of the chaos my brain experiences in the "figuring it out" process. so, if you're thinking that I've gone off of the deep end -- I have not; I've always been like this and it's how I figure stuff out -- just since this blahblog, I've been attempting to write stuff I'm still figuring out -- rather than only the stuff I've given previous thought to.

it's fine, as I'm pretty sure this is just a phase (or maybe not actually). I kinda like this sort of brainbarfing. it gives me more negative feedback, but I think it's totally fine.

---

the other thing I wanted to talk about is, in the previous entry, I said that only people meeting the minimum requirement of bad-feeling are elligable for expanded perception. the sense I had is that I was putting off a "holier than thou" vibe when I said that.

if I feel bad, then I will want something to make me feel better. this is normal. I used to use drugs all the time to feel better. I do agree that using conditions to feel better is not really a good solution, as it usually exacerbates the problem -- because rarely do people use the good-feeling of the condition to modify the underlying perception. instead, they just begin to rely more and more on the condition.

this will be most likely what happens to most. I noticed when reading oahspe that osiris got thothma to build the pyramid's foundation on wanting to preserve the physical body. it's almost certain that so many of these fallen-angels are all extremely conditional, needing certain conditions to survive. I think it's sorta like glasses -- they don't really "correct" the underlying reason for having out-of-focus vision -- just focus the image to make things clearer -- which just causes the person to rely on them more. in the same manner, I find it very unlikely that anyone will actually choose to have bad conditions and make the mental effort to change one's perception, when it's much easier to just get glasses.

I realise that this is the same subject as pharmaceuticals and addictions, and ... and ... and... it's human nature to look for the technology or conditions to temporarily treat the symptoms... (I think that's how to say it).

from my perspective, that problem is a good thing. I had this conversation with dad the other night and I explained that most people are motivated by physical, social, or emotional things .. the greatest of these is emotional things, because you have full control over how you feel. if I'm motivated socially, anyone can tell me what to do and how to feel, so I have to find people I trust, and ones who won't tell me to feel a way I don't want to feel -- etc. if I'm motivated by physical conditions, again this is problematic for a number of reasons (acquisition, tolerance, image, presentation, circumstance, etc.)

so really, the best thing that can happen to anyone is for them to enter into this state where they're completely motivated by how they want to feel rather than than other things.

it's only in that state that one begins to take control of how they want to feel, and that's a super good thing. once one takes a look at the alternatives, being "addicted" is actually the first steps on the path to freedom. I don't mean to say this the wrong way, but I will: I consider an "addict" more free than subordinate or a rich person. why? because they'll do anything to feel the way they want to feel; so you can't control them; only they can control them.

I really reconmmend that people do what they feel like doing rather than feeling socially or economically motivated or obligated.

### 2022-04-23 20:40 - obligation and addiction

I noticed when I woke up just now how similar those last two subjects are. imagine for a moment that you're a part of an organisation that has to maintain status quo (like a military or a government), because even if a certain number of the people think things could be done better, the organisation and the people are *obligated* to maintain status quo.

a good example of this may be certain parts of the government that must oppose human capacity for certain technologies because if those technologies were to be acquired, it would ruin their secrecy or security ...

for example, if there were a technology (like a quantum computer or something) that, even if it were to be very useful for us, but it made cracking passwords or reversing hashes a really easy thing, then they would have to prevent that technology from getting into our hands -- no matter how useful that technology could be. or, for example if the technology could be weaponised. like, imagine there were a way to direct the energy coming from the sun at something -- well, that would be 100% free energy in limitless supply (the sun would have to stop working, and that would be a far bigger problem than not having electricity and it won't happen) -- well, that too could easily be weaponised (like the vajra?) to destroy massive things by focusing the energy toward something. therefore, because unlimited electricty from the sun can be weaponised, then they can't allow us to have it.

those examples may sound silly, but I'm fairly certain that something similar to that already exists -- and it's sorta on top of that idea that I constructed my "decentralised socialism" prediction -- the decentralised part is because it needs to look as if the people have the power (ie. democracy), but really it's controlled by whomever has the most resources (the whales). the socialism part was because they'll have to quell our actual access to and capacity to understand these technologies, and since you can't really take something away, they'll have to offer the technology's product in a controlled way, so that we don't actually understand the technology (you know, so like some random guy can't modify his mobile phone to blow up the white house or something).

those people in those organisations are *obligated* to make actions from those social obligations -- meanwhile, an "addict" is driven by their need to feel the way that they want to feel. therefore an addict will give up on most circumstances in order to feel the way they want to feel.

I know because this is what happened to me. I see massive parallels for society in general (excluding the ones with those obligations) and my own experience. it came to a point where I simply couldn't get the conditions that I needed to feel good (MDMA, weed, smokes, etc) and so therefore because I was so emotionally motivated now without conditions to produce those emotions, I was *forced* to find a way to feel the way I wanted to feel without the conditions.

I don't want to say that this is the future for everyone on the planet, because I don't see it that way. instead I see it dividing into the two major groups: those with the economic capacity to purchase the conditions necessary to feel the way they want, and those that can do it perceptively.

the first group is capable of finding ways to satisfy their needs/wants and the second group *is* (I AM) the satisfaction of their needs/wants. in it's most simple form, it's just forcing people to separate into their most evoloved version of their desire (evolution-of-desire) -- and those that want to find the thing they want/need in their own capacity rather than looking for it externally will attract the conditions (this is the return to source/night-side/attraction phase), meanwhile others will use other conditions to construct the conditions they want/need (which is the emission/assertive/positive phase extending out from their source).

neither phase is superior to the other, but it's easy to see that the mindsets in action if looking at it like a hill. some people work so hard to climb the hill and expend so much effort, and those that they're passing on the trail up the hill seem to be passing them at a rapid speed (because they're walking down the hill, not up it). you could say that those walking up it are attracted to the summit and desire to make the effort, meanwhile those walking down the hill are attracted to the plain below and are just allowing theirselves to effortlessly go toward it.

the hill analogy is kind of a bad one, because it's kinda hard to imagine a hill that can appear uphill both ways or downhill both ways, but that's what perception is all about. we cling to our belief that we must expend effort to go toward the goal.

I'm reminded of a picture on facebook with a guy who walked up a hill with thorns on it. he's standing at the top with bloody bare feet a trophy and all those looking at him from the bottom don't see his bloody feet and sacrifice it took him to get to the top there. that image resonates with a lot of people -- and, those that believe it will walk uphill both ways because that's their perception.

it's pretty likely that the perspective of the guy on top of the hill was that, for him, it was actually a *downhill* slope filled with thorns and sharp plants, and he had no choice but to go that way. in fact, it may even be that in his perspective none of those thorns were actually thorns, but he presents his journey as a series of difficulties so people won't resent him anymore than they already do for getting to the top.

did he *want* to get to the top? did he *need* to get to the top? or, did he have a perspective of himself that effortlessly propelled him to the top, naturally?

only he could say for sure, but 100% guaranteed that all of those thorns there are his own perceptions.

### 2022-04-24 00:40 - snake trip

it's hard to describe how I feel after listening to the last ep of snake-bros #240. I felt desire to listen to it, meaning that there was interest to know my reaction to it. though the first part was especially relevant with the UFOs stuff, as I can't wait for the next installment with laura pinning marty to give more elaborated answers -- as that's going to be pretty cool. I also felt like the conclusion to that email was also very relevant in that there could be endless discussion on the subject, but they/we simply don't have the capacity yet to fully understand the many phenomenons[^1].

what I mean is that there also felt like it felt kind of silly to continue to discuss the phenomena if there's no way to actually directly experience it and explore it deeper.

this is my own view on drugs. when I first found out that I was stuck in nosebook, I was very sad because I had only begun to explore this area of the mind. I figured out how to expand my vision and it seemed to me to be infinite, so I (of course) wanted to explore it. however, knowing that nosebook is actively preventing me from experiencing it (hang on, this ties in to what I'm going to say next about the trip) made me feel very sad because I really believed that I wouldn't ever get to actually explore this astral world (the visual part of it).

according to the sirians, only the first 3/7th of the conceptual world (the concrete mind) has visual parts to it and this is what interfaces with the imagination. I was wanting to see it in order to believe (explore) it. over time, I realised that I didn't need to see the conceptual world to believe it. I didn't really need the manifestation of being able to see the angels, demons, fey, etc, to expand my interaction with this world.

there was another part in that episode about "not looking back" which I thought the part about addiction is really relevant to that, and it reminds me of a tick episode where he fights the proto clown and gets hit into outer space and goes on a journey inside of his mind. the part about self-realisation was the part where he has to not look (just believe) and then step out into the great abyss. this imagery is also in "most holy trinisophia" as well, and in the temptation was to have the rich guy guide him -- which was a false guide.

---

what I'm trying to say is that the aspect of looking (back or forward) is the utilisation of sensory input to determine your direction: inotherwords, you go toward what you're tuned to -- so, if you want to go toward physical, don't look back to the conceptual world and if you want to go to the conceptual, don't look back to the physicsal.

in a lot of ways, I've essentiall chosen the conceptual path, and so it's kind of like a trecherous path for me to "look back" or try and do things the old way. for example, after I had the brain haemorrhage (or these people involved with these UFO/fey/spirital experiences), and I was forever changed. I simply couldn't go back to doing things the way I used to do them. effort to try and do so, were met with difficulty. the way that I experience it, is that each "layer" seems to be counter-rotating from the previous[^2], so the conceptual way of doing will "against the grain" of the previous physical way of doing things.

yesterday I wrote @[blahblog](2022-04-23 11:20) to explain this idea, but it feels like I'm in the bermuda triangle and all of my senses are completely out of sorts (so I gatta rely on the instruments rather than my physical senses). anyway, you could imagine this is kinda what death[^3] feels like too, and it takes a while to orient oneself either back into the physical where effort is necessary or up into the conceptual where everything is effortless and thoughts become reality instananeously.

therefore, for me this entire situation feels entirely "against the grain" for me, as I'm becoming a conceptual being. everything works differently and I have to tune to what I want to experience. I can't really "look back" and try to go back to the old way of doing things.

---

it's hard to explain this feeling, because there's a definite part of me that wants to go and hang out with marty and stuff and talk about all of this, but the reality is -- well, there are two: first, nosebook cannot allow it to happen because I seem to bring up a lot of taboo topics, and it would be very unwanted for that to happen. I don't really mind that they want to try and hold all of this such a secret, as I believe the whole goal is *not* for me to come and try to be a saviour to anyone -- but instead that some sort of separation will happen instead (temporal as in split or physical as in pluto) which will allow them to keep their secret going[^5]. the whole point, is for them to keep their charade going for a long time, and they can't have a reckless hotshot (me) roll through and blow it. if their secrets are blown, then they don't have any obligation anymore to maintain business-as-usual. the other reality that's happening is that I simply don't mind that they want to hold off until the very last second when they have to make the separation. I'm not doing this for any reason other than for my own expansion and capacity to tune to what I want. I don't yet feel like I'm very good at that. when I'm good at it, then you'll know (or maybe not because the separation has happened and they've covered it up).

I just don't really think it's a problem, and actally because the-problem-is-the-solution, I'm totally going to the very bitter end. I *want* them to get as much capacity that they can get to hold people back, because the better the capacity they have the more people have to actually find their own way. it's kinda messed up, I know. anyway, I've always maintained that I'm just the pre-game show. later, there will be others. who are the others? you are. anyone that wants to be, is. that's the point. nobody else is going to "save" you. only you can save you by tuning to what you want and then actually believing it[^4]. that's all I'm doing. I'll get there eventually, and it'll be awesome.

[1]: I think it's plural. I always get these confused -- when to use phenomena and phenomenon. this sentence is a problem because it can be read as singular or plural, "understand the [many phenomena | phenomena]". I've got no idea cause it looks both singlular and plural to me so how do I know which tense to use? anyway...

[2]: upon writing this, I don't know why it feels that way to me. I would have guessed that the imaginary layer is counter-rotating, but perhaps, the imagination is just the turbulant inbetween layer (convergence line) between two systems (like a storm front where more lightning strikes happen between two pressure systems)

[3]: I mean the state further than the astral. I define the astral as the state where visuals become reality really quickly. there's a part in dtp where he sees lolix and their bloody baby.. there. there's a transition from the earth based reality that everyone believes in, to things you believe in (traumas, emotions) manifesting into visuals (like lolix and the baby) and then finally devachan where nearly all resistance is released. though it feels natural in devachan that everything should just appear as its conceptualised, it takes a little bit of time to get used to that when coming from a physical perspective -- and likewise, it takes a child a little while to realise that everything he/she sees is not "real" (ie. the thing everyone else believes is "real" too).

[4]: it's kind of unfortunate that kids get here and they have all these adults around them that cannot see the reality that they see, so after some time, they come to "see" the reality that the majority sees, rather than the one they see. it takes years of practise to see the mainstream reality that everyone else sees, but they eventually "grow up" enough to finally see it.

[5]: the idea here being that they want to wait until the very last moment before making the split, ensuring that they've extracted the all that they can out of me.

### 2022-04-24 02:02 - lightning and concepts

another idea popped into head. at the end of snake-bros #240 I wasn't really listening because for whatever reason I wanted to play a game (I think this happens when there is conflict in my head and I want to ignore/distract myself from it), and they were talking about the electric universe and impact craters being perfectly circular, and the EU has the idea that perfectly circular ones are likely discharges. they got to talking about fulgerites(?) and I don't know much of what to say about that, but an "image" popped into my head...

this morning, I was considering what a frequency or wave actually is. there used be an ether, and this was a medium that carried waves through it -- but what exactly was it carrying, I didn't know. I then imagined a planet or a moon passing through a much less viscous water, and this would be the "ether". well, the "wave" now is just something going around in a circle. imagine a planet like earth and its moon traveling through water. the moon will be making "waves" in the water, and we would look at the periodicity of those waves and say it has a frequency. the force (voltage) of that wave would purturb the water so as to make it appear that at a point in a path, that wavefront would oscillate the water.

you could imagine an electon(?) is this moon spinning around the planet purturbing the water. the electron moon would be powered by it's central planet, but (that I know of), there is nothing that we identify with as the central position around which these electrons orbit around.

OK, now let's zoom out a bit and consider that one of those electrons has solidified enough to become a comet or a meteor. from what we know, these comets and meteors iteract with large gravitationaal masses like planets and stars. some of these meteors crash into the planet or the star (ie it attracted them too much), or they continue to oscillate around or between these bodies. when they crash into these planets/stars, we can consider that "resistance" and that gets converted to thermal energy (heat).

OK, now let's go somewhere else -- and imagine neurons and the electrical signals that pass between them. I can imagine that what is passing between these neurons is actually a "concept" and those concepts have a number of electrons orbiting around them, their collective magnitude is their "voltage" or potential. I can think of this like a meteor. it has all of this angular momentum (potential energy) stored up, and when it gets close enough to the planet or neuron that the breakdown voltage has been surpassed, a discharge will happen.

I imagine then that the concept will then be altered by the interaction with the planet/neuron and so therefore will be stripped of it's electrons/moons and or gain some more in different orbits, causing a change in vibration which will then do something ... I don't know.

---

the interesting thing about that image is that you could see how the perturbations of the water in which this concept and its moons are traveling would be perceived by us as "magnetism" and the oscillation of these waves would attract or repel thing depending on the other things coherence with its vibration.

if looking at sand floating in ocean water, it mostly oscillates with the waves, not really traveling too far -- and this could be seen as the electron travel speed.

the other thing this explains is why coils make magnetism, as current flowing through it purturbs the ether in such a way that it attracts other similarly orbiting metals. the magnetic/paramagnetic/diamagnetic property of any element is just the orbits of its "electrons", and similarly orbiting electrons attract eachother.

so, what's the ether made out of? is it even tinier concepts and orbiting electrons? like a fractal?

### 2022-04-24 17:19 - time snakes

I just listened to snake-bros #007 and in it kyle mentions the effortless power idea (can't remember the martial arts guy's name). he also mentioned (this was the earlier version of) the idea of being able to be aware of a period of time. he related it in one of the later episodes as being aware of like a 5 minute span of time called now, and I liked the idea so much but like russ said, "how would you even experience that?" and at that time I could begin to feel it, but I was caught up with the span of time part.

it wasn't until this listen that I figured out how to experience it. I'm writing it out here -- just in case someone may find this idea as invigourating as I do.

I'm looking at a figure I drew on paper on my desk where I have the sine wave of two octaves on top of each other, and in the part where the waves are nearby, because one wave is twice the size, they are more nearby to each other.

I have postulated that these are the "zero-points" where two seemingly opposite direction interzctions where one is double the speed of the other can be viewed as essentially the same "moment in time". that's the first part.

the next part is how I look at a concept. so imagine how it is that I write these messages (well, not all of them, because I've been blabing a lot lately) -- and essentially, I am looking at a mass of different particles, and these can be perceived as data or concepts -- and they each are orbiting (spinning) at thier own speed (much like how I described the electrons spinning around the concept in the previous entry). so just imagine this mass of spinning sub-concepts and supporting data as the thing that I want to write or to say...

what I do is I perceive one point, in the mass, and then a lot of times I'm trying to see how to get from one point to another point, and this makes a trajectory through the mass of vibrating particles. it looks a lot like lightning passing in a squigly or jagged route through space (it's not straight), and that's because so many of the spinning particles are affecting it's trajectory from starting point to destination.

if I can't find the path from one point to another, I add more concepts into the mass until I have a more complete picture with a suitable route. I try to add these concepts in "completed" form (ie. without resistance -- just the pure concept).

when I explain the concept to one person, that is, translate it, it always comes out a little different for each person, because I add the other person's perception (the way I feel them) into the mass, and that adds more spinning "electrons" and so therefore affects the  trajectory of my traversal of the subconcepts (the translation) from starting point to destination.

this is how the brain interprets linear time, and I have to take this 5d perspective where I see the concept from all angles at once and convert it into something coherent and linear that can be understood (like I'm doing now).

so, now imagine that the other person that I'm talking to, is kind of analogous to all the vibration present in the situation I'm in. like the retrocusality thing, I *feel* the thing before "I" (my physical senses) translate it into something that has happened.

---

it's so easy to want to transform it into a linear progression from one point to another because that translation, like a juicy soap gives you all the dirty details in the minute-to-minute breakdown, just like writing this is much more invigourating (lol) than just feeling the concept. I love writing these because I enjoy listening to myself translate the idea -- (and this is important) -- because my brain enjoys learning from what I already know. just because I know something doesn't mean my brain has experienced it. this is the immense pleasure I get from translating the concept into text.

so that really is the thing. in order to experience this sort of consciousness of a "span" of time (it would actually be perceived more like a concept where it's interacting and constantly trasnforming with everything around it in the "now". to explain this, when I see a concept, I see it like I see it now, but then later *I* change (so does the conceept interacting and attracting similar concepts), and so I see the concept later as a transformed/evolved verson of itself, or with "these eyes" because my own perception has changed... so I still see the concept and can see it's "future" and "past" interactions with itself in relation to me, but I'm still perceiving it now, and like any living thing, it's constantly transforming and evolving.

---

that doesn't sound as cool as what kyle was transmitting though, so I would say that's kind of like the "pure" (counter-rotating) version of the experience of time, but I have an intermediate solution that is why I wrote this, because I want to figure out how to "collapse the wave function" and traverse a path linearly while still remaining conscious of the whole. I'm not super duper good at this completely, but you see me doing it here where I maintain interaction with the concept and can alter my linear trajectory if I don't like the feel of it.

I can't really explain very well, but I'm sure for everyone else they will just see my linear traversal through time, but I'm beginning to have this idea that I can go back and seemingly "alter" my passage through time. the best way I can describe this is .. say something to someone that they will take the wrong way, or wait until someone takes something you say the wrong way (or misunderstands you), and give little importance to that, and instead alter the feeling that *you* felt in that interaction so that it felt like they understood instead of that they misunderstood, and notice how all of a sudden they seem to now understand you. well, you just switched "timelines". it's like that.

so the idea is to enjoy the linear progression through time, but have the ability to modify the "past" (or is it the present in the "span of now"?) to be the timeline that you want to experience.

now, the next part is to learn how to "complete" all of reality such that it would not bother you to even go back into another "place" -- like what if you missed the bus and instead felt yourself at the bus or at home, or wherever you wanted to go? in your perception, you got there traversing through a lot of (completed) concepts that didn't have a whole lot of significance, and so therefore you weren't held into a different version of now because of them.

I'm really going to have to find a better way to explain it. all I can say is, you won't notice much difference when I figure it out. I'll appear much the same, just have more and more increased "good timing" and it'll appear like things start getting easier and easier.

that's all for now... I don't have it yet, and I'm still quite a ways off, but having realised a way of how it could work means that now I can go do it. easy :)

anyway, I'm sure that this idea will be the first of many because ever since the "retrocausality" experiments, I've really been fascinated by this. you'll see ... I hope. I really want to find a way to first get it, and then demonstrate how effortless it all is.

also, of note, when listening to it, I also had a strange desire to meet that martial arts dude. hopefully one day I will; that'd be cool.

cheers. I have a lot to think about more now!! so awesome!!

### 2022-04-25 11:47 - STS or STO?

when I was younger, I would read a lot of that alien channeling stuff and a really common theme that appeared was the idea that the good aliens are "service to others" and the bad aliens are "service to self". since meeting abraham (they teach selfishness), I've reconsidered that idea.

however, it came to my attention the idea of "snake time" (previous entry) about this idea of STO. to be clear, I'm still a ways off from actually perceiving reality in that way. I wrote it out because I thought the idea was so fascinating and others may want to make similar implementations.

you see, perception is individual. we think we're all experiencing the same thing, but I assure you, that is a complete illusion. we may be looking at or hearing the same things, but the experience and its underlying meaning is very different for every person. there are groups of similar perception though -- and I'm beginning to think that may be one of the more interesting metrics for a "species" -- not breading capacity or similar attributes, but similar perception.

going on this idea a little more, yesterday russ and kyle (I think in #006) were talking about longheads and giants being another parallel hominid species existing parallel to humans. though they have long heads and their size is different, the sense that I get is that these alternate hominid species perceived reality in a very different way than we do. russ relayed a whole thing about this world bank whistleblower and she said that the longheads (decended from akhenaten) were very calculating and mechanical (3rd ray).

I think that's important to look at because I believe that up until just recently (let's say til sometime in the 80s), most people were 2nd ray types, but increasingly there are more and more 7th rays.

the difference between 2nd ray and 3rd ray perception is extremely noticeable. a 3rd ray will put everything into parts (compartmentalise everything) meanwhile the 2nd ray will look to see how everything can relate to another thing. the 2nd ray isn't very creative though because it's so busy relating and making connections (think sales team), that what I think happened is that the longheads (3rd ray types) actually were the catalyst to attract many more 7th ray, 1st ray, and 5th ray types, because (from their perspective) 1st rays are easy to control, 5th rays will be able to produce the concepts and 7th rays implementions necessary for their calculated structure.

also, it's interesting to look at the longheads as the latest 3rd ray incarnation on this planet, because each of the triads (minus the last vulcan 7th ray one) have a 3rd ray in it. the last one is interesting because instead of a 3rd ray it has an opposite polarity 5th ray (vulcan), so he takes up that 3rd ray role but implements concepts rather than structure focussing more on the whole of the concept and how all of those parts work together rather than just the structure itself (in the form of mechanical parts).

you can see how these longheads running the economic show are causing a tremendous change in human perception.

---

that's totally not where I wanted to go with this... so, going back to how I'm in the process of designing this form of perception: it's like any language that one learns -- as in, it requires that one begins to perceive reality through this new format, so for the designer, it takes some getting used to seeing the same reality a different way. it's easy to look at reality the same way (ie. a human "species"), but to make a new form of perception is entirely different.

so, to give an example, when I was at the santo daime ayahuasca ceremony, I was sufficiently removed from my paradigm ("liminal state") that I noticed that if I were to just look for the space between me and what I'm looking at, I can see something new. it took some practise, but I figured it out.

well, this is no different. my major takeaway from yesterday's entry was that there are spatial concepts in the traditional sense -- like the stuff that I see naturally now -- the "image" that isn't really an image which is present before the imagination sees it; some people call it a "knowing". well, that concept world is to the imagination, like ... well, just imagine a bunch of those things residing inside of a non-physical reality. like, for example imagine that you had a "knowing" of all of the things present in your reality and their interactions with each other (I'll call these temporal concepts, in contrast to the previous spatial/abstract concepts). all of these exist in that reality of "now" which extends further out than just one moment, and just like the abstract/spatial concept combines with counter-rotating physical details[^1] to produce an image in the imagination -- so, does this form of perception do the same thing temporally rather than spatially. I have a knowing/sense of all of the things in my reality and their interactions with eachother, and then I can move around inside of that space just like I can move the image around in my imagination.

it's the same thing as the imagination -- just for temporal concepts. what helped me to understand this was that russ said, "that's what memory does" -- and that's a difficult concept to explain, but it's kind of like "remembering the future" and "prophesying the past". I'll leave it at that for lack of a good way to convey the idea in a clearer way.

---

I love this stuff. this is what I live for. I'm always trying to find out new ways to expand my perception and new ways to look at the world. for me all of this is fun. in my perception, I do it for me. I'm wholly STS in that aspect.

anyway, what prompted this was a reaction that I was getting because others thought that this idea is cool too, and I don't have any problem sharing it. however, the fact that I want to share this and other things so much makes me appear more like STO -- though I strongly contend the word "service" because there's no duty or service for me. I *love* it! all of this is fun for me. it's the main reason why I love drugs so much. I probably experience the same amount of exhileration from it as faucet believed he would have to find the "z city" or tesla to find a new electrical something. discovery is so intoxicating.

anyway... it occurred to me that another change of perception is on its way, because nosebook really does not want ideas to spread, and they definitely don't want perception to spread, either. so, they're in the busineess of turning everyone else into a STS rather than STO to ensure as few things spread as much as possible. it's kind of funny how a bunch of 3rd ray longheads are looking at it like they need everything compartmentalised with no relating, and that worked when we were mostly 2/6, but now it's going to be pretty hard to do both perceptually and technologically. they'll probably allow people to expand technologically, thinking that's easier to control.

either way, I'm still doing all of this for my own enjoyment anyway.

### 2022-04-28 01:11 - resistance and stuff

yesterday I listened to snake-bros #012 and in it kyle was talking about how if you *resist* a string at the half-way point the sound doubles in frequency (because the string size divides into two shorter ones). this only works when placing the finger lightly on the top of the string. if doing the same thing 1/3 down the string divides into 3 and triples the frequency. I *think*, normally, when placing a finger on the guitar neck, you push it all the way down so it shortens the string to be 2/3 instead, raising the frequency of the string by 2/3 instead of 1/3 (I think).

this got me thinking a lot about resistance, and a long time ago I read this one guy called "walter russell" and he had this idea that you have pure white light, ie continuous spectrum white light containing all of the frequencies, rather than just a few of them, and then what he did was to divide the light based on proportions just like kyle was doing on the piano (he switched to the piano to compose the colours of sound by mixing two wavelengths).

that super fascinated me because I had thought of resistance as attenuating *amplitude*, not increasing frequency!! I still don't have it all sorted out, and it got me thinking about the line in DTP where he says that you can resist this "night-side" or attractive force to produce heat, light, sound, etc. look it up if you want: @[dtp/dtp](chapter-1-4)

it's interesting that perspective because walter russell extended this theory all the way to the chemical elements, saying that certain elements are just octaves of eachother, containing a faster vibration, and so therefore appear to have more "mass". in the same episode, they were talking about how blueshift will cause something to increase in mass if it's traveling toward you because of the increase in frequency.

so that's where I'm coming from on this...

---

later on that day I was talking with jaron about how weather "predictions" aren't even close, because if you look at the "forecast" for now, the reported temps are often way different than the forecast -- which basically means they're not actually feeding the reported temps back into the fitness function to correct the reports (for whatever reason), assuming that the model is a neural network of sorts. I suggested that the "forecast" may actually be tuned to not actually forecast the weather, but to provide the most believable temperature for people to think it is. I gave the anecdote that I used to look at these models and they were always wrong, so I stopped looking at them, then I looked at reported temps and found them to be more accurate, but still not very accurate -- with unbelievably cold or warm temperatures out on the field, but reported temps just over the hill at the airport being at least 10-20C different than what I experienced.

I supposed that if the weather forecast could get people to believe in rain, it was more likely to happen than if you didn't believe it would rain. I'm always reminded of jerrica's mom on this one -- where, nobody else thought it was going to rain but her, and in her little section of pueblo was the only place it was raining.

personally, I found out, that what I believed the weather would be like had a *much* stronger effect on it than anything the forecast would say. I used the anecdote of my time in la vera caceres spain, and I loved the warm weather so it stayed warm, but they were starting to get concerned about it not raining. after some time, I finally agreed that it could rain (combined with some bad-feeling -- forget why) and it released a very strong downpour. this remindid me of these cataclysms where rain is withheld for a long time then all of a sudden some bad feeling triggers the downpour (this is plato's account).

I've given a lot of thought to this, and from my perspective, the way it works is that humans have an aura and we emit this orgone energy outward and this is what creates warm nice weather, but it's very bad for raining as this outward flow of energy increases evaporation, rather than condensation. the earth has these cells of good-feeling output as high pressure cells. I noticed that when one has a sudden drop in emotional or orgone energy, it instantly creates a low-pressure vacancy, and this perturbs the air and allows the layers (of charge?) to begin mixing and is what ultimately allows the rain to begin falling.

the bigger the emotional disturbance of bad-feeling, the lower the pressure in the system is created and so therefore it'll attract more rain faster.

I then talked about these orgone tubes that this one guy put on his airplane (I forget but I found it through joseph brown I think) and it talked about how these tubes (I think they were copper) would purturb the air in such a way as to create ripples and eventually cause the rain.

what I think is happening is that if one imagines the sky like a bunch of rubberbands, as the plane pulls along on the strings, there is an expansion (low pressure) where it's passing, and then when the string snaps back, a contraction (high pressure), and this gets these orgone charges mixing (so they're no longer separated) and is what ultimately causes rain.

I've wanted to study orgone for a while because it's related to sex/orgasm energy, creative energy, and emotional energy. it appears to operate entirely opposite of the way electricity does. it likes sameness, and mixing causes the disturbance, which is opposite of electricity when mixing causes the balancing. it appears to be affected most by geometry/shape and substance type mass.

so, I went to plug this orgone idea into my new concept of the ether mentioned in @[blahblog](2022-04-24 02:02), and it made sense to me, so I'm going to try and relay that idea here.

orgone accumulators are layers of organic and inorganic material. since I don't really know what inorganic is (everything not CHON?), for now, I'll just assume that inorganic is conductor, meaning free electrons, and organic meaning no free electrons. the way I heard that they work is this invisible substance passes through them (so ether or magnetism, probably) and the inorganic layers reflect the energy back not allowing it to escape, while the reason why it goes through the metallic layer in the first place is that it was attracted to the organic layer.

personally, I believe that this is probably going to be hydrogen or H+ ion (proton) because that's what organic stuff is looking for. I remember there was this thing where carbon has three "docking stations" -- and...

I'm gonna tangent for a second, because I've been thinking about "hexagonal planar" arrangement that produces white light. as best as I can tell, hexagonal planar is not a hexagonal lattice, but actually a bunch of cubes connected. they look like hexagons because we're looking at them from the "root 3" perspective (you know, like the middle of the vesica picsis), and a cube has three "root 3" axises, and these are the three dimensions that carbonacious molecules build in. so, a single carbon atom is basically a cube, and each of its 3 axises are looking to attach something to it. if it doesn't have something there already, it wants, hydrogen. so, let's say you're a plant and you need to construct yourself from the C just pulled in from the CO2. I don't see this part well enough, but something strips the electron in some cases and it wants another electron (ie. growth) and in other cases, it strips a proton and wants a replacement.

well, it appears that something is constantly stripping one of these things (let's say electrons cause that's what I used to be spinning around the concept/nucleus) and so this is what these organic compounds are attracting. what I believe is stripping these electrons is "magnetism" -- which is what I defined as the 3d purturbations (waves) extending outward from the motion of electrons in the ether.

---

I experience a lot of chaos in my head as reactions. I'll come back to this later. but the way I see it is there is only electrons spinning around a proton/concept and the purturbations are what create magnetism (ie emotion/orgone energy).

hasta luego

### 2022-04-28 10:40 - intercalate layers

I still want to talk about the idea of resistance *increasing* frequency, but it seems that after the tangent about carbon being like a cube has brought a lot of new ideas.

I started to think about the intercalate layers of the sun (or graphene) and so if I think about a grid of cubes connected at their points, between each three-sided "pyramid", there would be a diamond shaped cavity. where molecules will get trapped between the layers.

so then, when I thought about the layers, it seemed obvious to me that cubes could connect on the verticies, but that seemed weird because if the vertex is say positive, it wants a negative molecule to attach to it. another carbon would also have a positive vertex, so it'd be unlikely they would connect vertex to vertex, instead preferring to sit side-by-side in a sort of zig-zag pattern fitting next to each other.

so then, if they would want to sit together in a cubic arrangement, what would make multiple graphene layers stay apart -- and furthermore, why do the cubes want to connect to each other on each point in the first place? if I consider each cube to be something like a magnet with each vertex as either N and its opposite south, then they would stick together, and also chairality makes a difference. so what it would appear is that in the case where two cubes are N-N arrangement, they wouldn't connect and that's what would create the intercalate layer which would extend out as far as the carbon is wide.

I'm not sure if that's right. it doesn't really feel very right

---

the other way, and the original way I saw it is that all of the carbons could be charged so that the group of them were more positive or more negative, and so then the intercalate layers would be oppositely charged layers. so like let's say the "top" of one layer is more positive, and the "bottom" of the layer above it, is also more positive, so they would repel each other. this would create that intercalate zone, and the amount of charge would determine their separation, and therefore the size of the molecules/elements that would fit in the intercalate layer.

in the case of the sun, one could imagine a nova explosion or some other event where the star rapidly expands to simply be the aligning of the layers so they're N-S-N-S-... rather than N-S-N-S || S-N-S-N. I think this could happen when some of the elements trapped in the intercalate region affect the hydrogen layers on one side and its intensity is enough to cause a cascade effect.

I often wondered what could cause something to reverse its spin direction. a long time ago, I postulated that for this planet and probably for electrons and other things, it would be when something flips over, causing it to spin the opposite direction. I also heard (but don't know for certain) that an electron jumping to a higher energy state causes it to spin the opposite direction.

I dunno. so this idea is pretty interesting because if layers of carbon could be produced exposing one side to hydrogen, letting the other be neutral, then graphene sheets could probably be pretty easily produced. that'd be really really good for high capacity energy storage devices like rob was/is working on.

anyway, just shower ideas... so who knows if they amount to anything.

### 2022-04-29 02:45 - to david :: a few thoughts inspired

so I woke up just now with a lot of different ideas. since I've been writing letters to people, I decided I would try and do the same here and think my thoughts out a bit before blabbing. this is especially the case with david, as we'll almost certainly talk again, and I don't really want to come off so airy-fairy.

---

a little bit after we hung up I did remember the question that I wanted to ask you -- it was about the "kingdom age" -- as, when I was younger, I interpretted the "kingdom of heaven" to be the space age -- like, when we leave the planet and go to start exploring other planets and stars. however, I've gotten the sense that lately when most people say, "kingdom age", they are referring to a mythical time in the future when we will return to monarchy, but because it's jesus that's the king, like some sort of upgraded version of king arthur, it's going to be some sort of paradise on earth.

---

the next thing that bothered me was stresful emphasis on desire to look into seemingly meaningless rocks and stone artifacts, rather than pay attention to the morality message in the bible. I definitely agree that stone artifacts are weird thing to place so much attention on.

to be completely honest, after having looked at them for long enough, these stone artifacts (and the grail quest) are kinda the same thing for the masons and builders as the "kingdom age" is for the christians. the capacity to dress, work, and design stone temples in a harmony with the earth and cosmos seems to be the precursor to a mythical "golden age" for them.

the similarities between the christian kingdom age and the golden age differ really only in rulership style. personally, I don't believe that the monarchy style of rulership has produced many well and able-bodied individuals, but more people who are content to just be told what to do, accept their place in society and just do what's told. unfortunately, "science" falls into this same system, considering that if the king/queen is the monarchy, then the church would be "science". the parallels are uncanny.

anyway, I've been fascinated with this "tower of babel" idea lately because I'm beginning to get the sense that after the fabled mythical golden age of atlantis came to a screeching halt, humankind rebuilt, but there was a group of people who had kept the knowledge of the ancients (pillars of enoch, etc), and I believe they rebuilt the "world system" in a different and even more orgainc (harmonious to the earth) way, and this is probably the pyramids around central and south america (north america was mostly covered with ice), and china, cambodia, india, etc. (the cam/khem culture). when they rebuilt the world system, the re-enabled the "world language" (which I believe was telepathy and transmission of concepts visually) by hightening a specific type of solar energy on this planet that science does not recognise.

so, if atlantis was sorta like the united states of its time (what we think of as masculine), being very material and "hard sciences", the rebuild after the cataclysms, would be much more feminine, asian, with softer corners, rounder, flatter, and much more connected to nature. clearly, this didn't work because we don't really see much of it left over, and I believe the reason for it has nothing to do with how "in tune with nature" you are, or how tall your structures are[^1] and sharp your edges are, there is still an underlying problem which is that some thing we do causes the earth to begin to vibrate sympathetically with us, and it attracts cataclysms. they could happen periodically, but the fact that we had two major world setbacks in such a short period of time seems to suggest that these cataclysms are a reaction to human emotion.

so, even if king arthur or jesus would return right now to this earth and setup another golden/kingdom age of utopia, another cataclysm would inevitably follow.

the reason for this is the other half of the equation, which is the "morality" part of the equation. if everybody is following some sort of agreed upon code of conduct and there are no immoral people, the result is a bunch of people that feel good and therefore do not attract cataclysm (or destruction of their culture). one thing that is repeated throughout the OT/NT and many other ancient texts is the idea that unhappiness and dissatisfaction with others, the king, or the situaton is the precursor to disaster.

my research into the tower of babel, atlantis, and other things like that tells me that it's possible to mask dissatisfaction and unhappiness with good conditions, but that does not solve the problem. for example, many of the roman emperors had a lavish lifestyle, unlimited pleasure, and so on, yet looking at their statues, not even the artist couldn't mask their unhappiness.

although there are many theories as to the reason why the roman empire fell and some of the reasons for their later actions (like, why did they go up and fight the druids, or get crushed by the goths?) what would cause a thriving empire to continue to try and conquest further, when they're living in a very high society with many ammenities? I belive that ultimately the roman empire fell because of dissatisfaction. they had looted the library of alexandria and retrieved all of the secrets to producing this solar energy for theirselves which can levitate stones, increase mental capacities, etc. -- and yet even still with high society and ancient secrets -- dissatisfied.

---

so really, to some extent my research into these stone artifacts and other ancient things are a bit of a waste of time (I will definitely admit that), but I do think the concept of high society and good conditions (even in tune with nature), yet still attracting disaster is especially pertinent in today's age.

it appears to me that on this planet, that solar energy is rising rapidly, and what that means is that reality (as you conceptualise it to be) is manifesting more and more rapidly than ever before. this is exactly the precursor to "cataclysm", because in all of these cases, what seems to be the case is that the majority of the population was dissatisfied with their (physical/social/emotional) conditions and some combination of this negative emotion continued to cause more and more upheaval on earth.

so, what to do about it? well, I don't really think there is anything. a king could come and put a system of laws in place where if everyone follows them, then there will not be any dissatisfaction. this is kind of a return to OT law, and I doubt its success. the main problem is that you can't actually cause anyone to feel better about their situation than they do.

let's say there's someone that has a crappy job and they hate it. the goal is to get them to no longer feel dissatisfaction. one solution is to give them a better job so that they'll be happy there. well, someone has to fill the position of the previous guy, and so hopefully the new guy doesn't find the work unsatisfying. the other problem is, if someone is unsatisfied with life, it's very rare that better conditions make any lasting change in the person's decision to be satisfied. usually, the case is the opposite where better and better conditions are needed to try and cover up dissatisfaction (like the roman emperors). it always comes down to the fact that a person has to make their own choice to find satisfaction in whatever they're doing. it's an aquired character trait very difficult to "teach".

the other solution to this is to "automate all things" -- and so then because the robots are doing all of the unsatisfying work, we'll be left with only the good stuff. there was a great movie, "office space" on this subject. the conclusion of the movie is the idea that you have to "not give a fuck" -- and in the movie, peter finds out that he is happier when he stops caring about all of the meaningless busywork around him.

what's happening on the planet right now is accelerating this process, because those there are just soo many people out there now that, like me, seem to be (unfairly) living an easy life while they have to suffer doing all of the "shitty jobs that nobody wants (like cleaning toilets or something)".

those types of people will eventually destroy theirselves with their own dissatisfaction. some will find ways to control and manipulate their conditions in such a was as to continue to survive, but their dissatisfaction will continue to increase.

it's my goal to not try and come up with scientific discoveries that produce better conditions, but to instead come up with discovieries that make it easier and also more compelling to actually feel the way I want to feel. though there are so many very valid and logical reasons to feel bad, trying to find a way to look at the same way which doesn't produce dissatisfaction, allows for so many beneficial side-effects, I can only hope that my life is an example for others (cause you can't teach[^2] it) of this "theory" (it's more like a culture[^2]) in action.

[1]: which btw, I think it's ironic that it's called the "tower" of babel, when it looks to be, instead of a monolitic tower, a distributed set of very natural temples and pyramids with lots of rounded edges and circles (hardly the "american way" of boxes and sqares[^3]).

[3]: in fact, when looking at the indian temples (which I think were contemporary with the tower of babel phase, not 1000kya like they say), you'll see straight lines and box shaped pillars on one side of the temple, appearing almost as if work on them suddenly stopped, with all of the walls prior, not having any have any straight lines. therefore, it appears that there was great effort to turn the straight-line initial layout into a kind of curvy more feminine one -- and this must have reflected in the culture as well.

[2]: if it were only a theory, then it would be falsifiable, but it exists in this weird intermediate zone, kind like like culture. you can't falsify culture and you can't really "teach" culture either. it's something that's picked up only by example and immersion.

### 2022-04-29 07:21 - lucifer and his minions

so continuing on with the "tower of babel" discussion. in @[letters-to-russ](2022-04-29 04:24), and @[blahblog](2022-04-29 02:45) I correlated the epic of gilgamesh to the story of lucifer, which it's also been noted that enkidu also has a lot of christ and reborn-deity symbolism too, but the part that brought it together was the part about ishtar/anatau and her desire for the "bull of heaven" -- which is weird because in india there are a lot of temples that have two main deities, one is a bull, and the other is an elephant. well, zodiacally speaking the elephant is in libra and nearly opposite that is taurus. so, it could be perceived like a battle to see what sign the son/sun would rise in (precession). ishtar wants the bull otherwise the dead will rise up out of their graves (or take on human form) and outnumber the living.

this occurance of the "ressurection of the dead" is something that is prophesied to come in the "end times" and is the foundation upon which many of the egyptian ceremony is built.

in my opinion, this "resurrection of the dead" is nothing more than an energetic enough set of conditions here on earth (caused either by the sun, or from stone boxes and pyramids). this energy sustains life so well, that death is pretty much impossible. it's "vishnu the preserver" which is also the archetype for the son and the christ (the father being brahm, shakti, jehova -- so I guess the holy spirit is shiva).

either way, what happens is this vishnu energy rises to such a hight that the astral mixes perfectly with the physical and there is no longer any separation between the physical and the spiritual/astral. entites can come and go taking on physical form at will, and that's all really fine because the astral is made up of the same substance as the imagination, and so is always as its perceived to be. the physical however has entropy and decay as a function of the frequency which it's vibrating. so, if the vishnu energy is strong, then everything is perfectly preserved and does not decay or die. however, vishnu may be able to preserve the physical aspect, the emotion or attracting power of a person continues to do what it's doing. so, even if you have perfect physical conditions where nothing is dying (vis naturae), the person is still attracting conditions reflective of their emotions. the preserving vishnu energy won't let the conditions become dissatisfactory though and so what happens is it takes something extra-planetary (which vishnu's energy does not extend to), to finally allow one to realise dissatisfying conditons.

when that happened, all of the people on the planet at that time that *needed* the vishnu conditions to survive, realised their dissatisfaction and found all forms of life to be unsatisfactory. lots and lots of dissatisfaction. this is called "hell" today by religions. the more sensible explanation is that "hell" is just a whole bunch of very dissatisfied astral entites that have been trained (by lucifer) to *need* that vishnu/solar energy to be able to survive.

---

there seems to be three main factions in play: the martian/red ones (the gods), lucifer and his minions, and the humans. it seems that the red ones are quite good at building these vishnu structures, but they don't actually solve the problem of attracting dissatisfaction, so they keep attracting their own destruction (mars atmosphere, lack of magnetic field, etc) because no matter how well vishnu can preserve their conditions for them, they still keep attracting something that exceeds their capacity to prevent it.

what appears to happen is that each iteration, lucifer sets up a "world system" whereby this energy is pumped up to the top and astral is allowed to mix with the physical again and these dissatisfied entites (angels and demons) are once again "let loose on the earth" to spread their ideology out to the masses (the INFECTED ONES spreading their virus), and inevitably a number of humans are converted over to the conditional way of living (needing vishnu to perpetually save/preserve their material bodies), and then that attracts another cataclysm.

so, I believe the goal is to make it possible for these INFECTED ONES to run rampant in an entire galaxy running on this vishnu energy. they'll inevitably infect many humans to rely on this energy meanwhile doing nothing about their dissatisfaction -- which means that eventually we'll attract something big enough to clobber this galaxy (andromeda?) allowing them to manifest their dissatified state into reality.

---

I don't know if I'm lucifer or not, but the way I see it, this is kinda brilliant when understanding LOA. the-problem-is-the-solution, because they will create all sorts of really cool stuff and all of that energy is just energy and can be converted (like I'm doing with their dissatisfaction) into good-feeling energy.

so, when looking at it, it's kind of like a pyramid scheme and the ones that can convert bad-feeling energy (dissatisfaction) into something that feels good are the ones at the top of the pyramid. we feel good because of how bad all of them feel. they have no intention to change, so that's fine. they can keep powering my good-feeling more and more.

---

upon realising this, I realised again that each iteration the goal is to make more INFECTED ONES, not less. in oahspe, jehovih wants to try and convert the angels to become his property and do everything according to his will. my goal is exactly the opposite: my goal is to make more jehovihs and give them unlimited capacity to keep expanding his power and glory to gain more and more minions. they can have as many ranks, tiers, levels, etc. as they want and they can keep going more on the dissatisfaction until their world is sooo crowded, that they have to expand and create more tiers.

> "if you keep doing what you're trying to do, you'll own the world, you know that, don't you")

I was going to write this in a letter to patricia, but I decided I didn't want to drag her into my craziness, because I woke up this morning realising that I don't really want to try and push anything through at all. they will eventually have to do something because they can't not do something. they only make decisions based on dissatisfaction, so they have to wait until something is so dissatisfying to make action. if I were to try and make any action based on satisfaction or desire, it would ultimately fail because it wouldn't be the inevitable least-worst option.

I'm writing in double-speak now: what I mean is, they have to eventually do something, but if I wait until the conditions descend into their worst possible state, then they have to make the movement. I attract what I want, and because they're dependant on my energy, then I'll get what I attract, and they'll do the least-worst option presented to ensure they can maintain their survival.

so, if you think about it, the whole goal is to keep giving them the capacity to expand their ranks and influence further and further out. it's quite possible that this galaxy is the galaxy that I want to "create" and the whole point is to take tesla's world system and extend it out to the whole galaxy.

either way, it seems obvious to me that I don't actually want to try and make any action, but instead let them make all of the moves, attracting the concept in its completed[^1] state (hell yeah, peter!)

[1]: last night I was contemplating what he means by "completed" concept, because I think of the concept in this state as "pure" or "without resistance", and it dawned on me as I was writing that is that "completed" means in the implementation sense -- that it's had time to develop fully and become the manifestation of what I perceive it to be.

### 2022-04-29 20:14 - I don't understand what's happening

I can't figure out what's going on. first, mom asked me if I wanted to go to walmart with her and jaron. I decided I didn't want to go, but I felt desire for me to go. it didn't feel like real desire or there was something weird about it, so I think it could have been them making up the feeling so as to get me to go there. it was kinda weird so I stayed home.

I decided to listen to snake-bros #051 "what if it was the sun" -- and instead of listening to it, I mostly played a game on my phone. it was weird because it felt like there was desire to see what my reactions would be to that, but I just played the game. the main takeaway is that I noticed that russ didn't think tunguska was a bolide. personally, I believe it was tesla, not a bolide and it's interesting that it caused so many new species. it would be caused by gently tapping energy as it passes around the globe until it reaches a very high point. it probably took a few days to accumulate that much energy -- which is probably why the sky was so bright at night. then, it just would need something to do the opposite of it to make it go off -- like, if you're pushing the swing at the top of the backswing, push it instead at the top of the forwardswing, to begin the explosion.

anyway, after that I took a shower and then I wanted to take a walk. I decided to flip a coin so that mr. motor could cancel it if he wanted to. it said I should go to walk, which -- when I flip a coin like that the only time it comes up different than what mr. motor wants is if there is desire for me to do the opposite of what mr. motor wants. I figured someone wanted me to go walking. I hemmed and hawed for a while but then finally went, and motors were raging when I finally made it out.

it was really nice and I knew my vision has expanded, but it was nice to see things a bit more differently. I virtually saw zero people though. one person driving by seemed a bit concerned about the "pyramid scheme" though, but that's silliness, as there's nobody forcing anyone to feel bad. everyone makes that decision all by theirselves. also, there's nobody forcing anyone to maintain their perception eithter. again that's a choice, and anyone who wants to join me in the pyramid scheme, it's as simple as finding a way to feel the way you want to feel (good or bad doesn't matter; it's the control that counts), and then just by doing that you will already be feeling better than most people. your feeling good will inevitably inspire others to feelings of jealousy, revenge, hatred, anger, depression (I can't do that), or unworthiness (I'm not good enough), etc. -- and those feelings will be directed toward you. just, like peter in office space, "don't give a fuck" and off you go toward feeling better and better.

as you get more proficient at converting their feeling perceptually, the worse others feel about you, the better you'll feel and the better you'll see because you're lower resistance. it's the whole "effortless power" thing, but instead of a context of martial arts, this is just simple everyday life living.

some people think that there is only a limited amount of goodness to go around, and if I feel good, I'm robbing others of their capacity for good-feeling -- which just isn't true. some people have good conditions and pretend that they feel good, but they only feel good for as long as they have those conditions, and it's likely that they're building up a tolerance to the good-feeling anyway -- whereas, I've found that if the good-feeling comes from perception, I can gain a bit of a tolerance to the good-feeling (get used to feeling that good), but it's way different than the tolerance associated with drugs or addiction cause it still feels good (and often times better and better) for as long as I continue to appreciate things around me. appreciation is a bit conditional, but so is breathing, and sometimes even just breathing feels good. it's always a reflection of the emotion, so no matter where I am or the circumstances I'm in, they'll feel pretty similar to how I feel.

none of that is too hard for anyone to figure out. those that want to feel good will find a way to feel good, and those that don't want to feel good -- well, that's cool too because I/we will benefit from it. because it's inevitable that there will always be a percentage of people that do not want to feel good, this would normally in morality-based cultures be considered a really bad thing, but in my system, the more criminals and people who choose to feel bad, the better it is -- and, since I only attract my reality, if they were to ever find a way to cause me to feel bad -- well, that just illustrates a weakness in my perception -- a sort of "attack vector" that can be exploited.

it's like killing 10 birds with one stone because others are fuzzing and revealing attack vectors (weaknesses) in my perception, which I can then fix to feel better, and also they're providing free energy and more opportunity to feel better -- nobody is trapped, and nobody is forcing anyone to do anything, so there's no voilation of free-will or anything. in a mechanical sense, it's repurposing otherwise expended energy. in an electrical motor, imagine if you could take the "back emf" and convert it to free energy -- well, that's all I'm doing is just repurposing expended energy that would otherwise go to waste -- and anyone can do it.

hopefully that cleared up some confusion around my "pyramid scheme" -- as it's completely passive and imposes nothing on anyone, because it's 100% my perception. it's a pyramid anyway, not from my own efforts, but because people do not want to feel good. if people wanted to focus their energy toward what they want or at a different thing they don't want (instead of at me), they would no longer be contributing to my pyramid scheme.

this method also works in the positive aspect too, where the more people that believe in you the more "power" it gives you. this concept is explored in @[dtp/thoughts](jehova) (and elsewhere), and it's my supposition that this is what keeps astral entites (like ghosts and stuff still connected to earth) and what powers many conceptual programs. I believe that jesus used this technique, and while it is really good because the more people that beileve (in) him, the more miracles he can perform, it also has the downside that if someone is able to penetrate that belief, and allow doubt to enter,it won't work. I personally do not wish to try and rely on others' belief in me to accomplish things. I am self-empowered, not others-empowered, as I feel that I attract my own reality, and others harmonise with what I attract.

it is true that when many are gathered with the same belief, the effect is massive, but I don't want to rely or depend on others' belief to create what I/we can agree that we want. all of that seems so fragile and prone to failure. the idea of trying to get others on the same page as me seems detestible to me. I prefer diversity rather than sameness. as an example of this, consider a single global currency.

I'm done.

I wrote all of that because I could feel something around that, but I still don't know what's going on.

### 2022-04-30 05:46 - few more thoughts on pyramid schemes

first, there was some confusion of why I called it a pyramid scheme, and it's because I take in bad-feeling from others tuned to m/ perception, and then offer my energy to them for their utilisation. it's free for my to convert that energy, and so then inevitably with these sorts of people, because they live conditional lives, they have to have power structures and subordinates which get access to a portion of their resources. those minions of theirs also feel inferiorness and that causes the top guy to feel superior. superior and inferior are the same frequency, just looked at from opposite directions; the more superior one feels, the more inferior everyone else around has to feel to maintain that superiorness[^1].

from my perspective, there are those that use/need my energy for their survival, and its those that form the rest of the pyramid. I'm only the top point. my goal is not to depend on others, but to simply interact freely with them, which puts nobody else relating to me. this is important for being the top point, because in normal pyramid schemes, you're the top point of your pyramid, but the bottom of someone else's. so really, it's anyone else's choice to decide where they live in the system. the top point can have infinite depedents, but depend on no one else. the bottom points depend on others, but nobody depends on them.

so, when I say depends, I mean in the energy vampire sense. energy is free can be infinitely summoned, and it's only a person's inability to allow that energy (resistance, complication of the concept) which prevents that energy from flowing. so, without any resistance, the more dependents the more energy. this is why my whole thing is lowering of resistance. the lower my resistance goes, the more energy can pass through me. if I have zero resistance, I become a superconductore, allowing infinite quantites of energy to pass through me. when I say resistance, I do mean resistance in the DC sense, but I mostly mean it in the AC sense of disharmonious waves which cause destructive interference. the higher my frequency, the less resistance, because I have more harmonics to work with and a broader spectrum.

---

long intro. it occurred to me this morning that there's a good reason why these characters went the "bad-guy" route. I briefly mentioned that this same energy pyramid also works in the positive sense -- and, those that believe in (or the same as) you will cause an increase of energy to flow, however the difficulty there is that I would have to get everyone to believe the same thing and think the same (an impossible endeavour, IMO). however, if someone feels bad about and projects negative energy in my direction, I can convert that energy into whatever I want.

therefore, in that sense, for someone capable of transforming energy easily, it's far more beneficial to have a bunch of pepple feeling bad about me than it is for them to feel good about me. I like to think of this as the elija effect. he turned all of their disbelief into what he wanted, which was to ignite the alter covered in water.

in a lot of ways, this can be done with nearly everything. let's just take the 4-minute mile for example. it appears impossible to everyone until someone does it. the first guy to do it probably used some of this elija effect to empower himself, knowing that there are a lot of people out there that think he *can't* do it, so all he has to do is to tune into the emotion of their surprise when they find out it is possible, and just by tuning into that and feeling that emotional response from them (just like elijah tuned into the priests' surprise of the altar igniting). it's kinda like ante-retrocausality because you're just tuning into your own (and others) emotions in the future.

---

so, this is one of the reasons why I think a lot of the "bad-guys" weren't actually all that bad -- and it was their perceived badness which fueled their energetic capabilities. it was then others that totally didn't understand how to convert energy, which then thought that there's power in being evil and depending on some demon or something to give them powers.

it's pretty difficult to explain this concept because of all of the pre-conceived ideas about demons and energy vampires and stuff, so I'll just say that I'm about as close to "evil" as one can get. many others depend on me for their power and I use their dependence on me to further expand my good feeling. this works well for me because energy is infinite and easily transformed. for others, it doesn't work well and they have to keep switching bodies because they think they believe in a zero-sum system where there is only a finite quantity of everything. for me anything that is desired can be summoned, and that negative desire is also positive desire perceived backwards, so there aren't any limitations -- only a limitation in realised things which can be summoned.

---

so then, if the only limitation are concepts that are realised to be wanted, it could be seen that diversity becomes the problem, but in reality, it's much easier to desire an emotion or an abstract concept which has infinite physical manifestations, rather than a single physical thing.

I was talking to jaron about this the other day saying that "he doesn't know what he wants" and he responded a few times by saying "he doesn't know what he wants to *do*" -- but that's not what I meant. I meant, he doesn't know what he wants in an abstract sense -- as in how he wants to feel or what living style he wants to have (with mom or without) like with how much independence and self-scheduling.

what I'm meaning is that it's really hard to look at the different scenarios because each has their advantages and drawbacks to them, but if he could figure out what he wants in an abstract or an emotional sense, it's much easier to reason about and see if he's going in the direction that feels more like the way he wants to go.

let's say he wanted to feel more independent, then each situation either feels more independent or less so it's easy to see what is more and what is less desired. even if he wanted more money, then it could still be reasoned about, but see how money is already short-circuiting the desire for independence?

my point is, the less tangible the desire is (ie. the more emotional/conceptual the desire is), the less one has to believe in it being even possible[^2].

[1]: this is the case with all zero-sum things. like if there is $1000 total, I have to have at least $500 to be the most superior, leaving $500 to be divided amongst the rest.

[2]: this is such an important realisation because when believing in and desiring conceptual/abstract things, the less they need to actually obey the physical "laws" anymore.

### 2022-04-30 14:04 - why do I want to go to the bitter end?

I was sitting out in the sun (apparently there's an eclipse this new moon) and the question popped into my head, "why do I want to go to the bitter end?" I didn't really know what to answer, so I thought I would write to find out.

the first idea that comes to my mind is, cause the obvious thing to do is to just go with one of the girls or whatever to placate the problem. I don't like that response for a number of reasons, most notably because I'm making action decisions based on what other people want from me.

so, what is it that I actually want then? I think the last entry was about that in the sense that it's not really what I want to *do* but how do I want to feel (or what abstract idea am I looking to accomplish). in that case, the thing that exhilerates me the most is not trying to find some thing or someone which can make me feel good, but to continually find ways to feel good no matter the circumstances. I think normally, when one figures out how to feel good, their reality reflects that pretty rapidly (at least it does for me), so the fact that I have nosebook constantly working to ensure that my reality does not match the way that I feel, is a huge opportunity for me to feel a lot better than I normally feel.

to put numbers to this, let's say that 1000 units of good-feeling is enough to make a really good manifestation happen. well, with nosebook, let's say they have the capacity to increase the resistance by some really large number -- let's say 1000x resistance so that for every 1000 units of good-feeling I feel, I only physically feel 1 unit of it. therefore, in that setup, in order for a manifestation to happen I have to find a way to feel not just 1000, but 1000000 instead -- 1000 times better than I would normally have to feel to get the manifestation.

in reality, it's probably much more than that, as they're likely continually improving their capacity to resist the way I feel. I don't have numbers, but I would guess it's millions of times better than I normally would have to feel before a manifestation can happen. this is such an amazing opportunity because that gives me the opportunity to build up a lot more potential before the arc finally happens.

the other way to look at it, and this is the one I prefer, is that if I consider the difference between how I feel and how others feel, I feel considerably better than a lot of people do, and that creates that pyramid scheme that I talked about, but if I were to get the manifestation, most people would just be watching me rather than attracting their own manifestation. by holding off, it allows many more people to find a way to perceive their own way toward what they want.

the last way to look at it, and this is the one I most prefer, is that if I consider the "cataclysm" angle. I've been looking at the geophysical effects of negative emotion, and how that (I believe) is the attractor of cataclysm -- as in these cometary impacts and solar outbursts are attracted by us, and are not at all random. contrary to most belief, I would say that if the majority of the planet were feeling good, it would actually be *impossible* for a cataclysm to happen -- and I mean good, not just bored or content because those will allow the manifestation of dissatisfaction of others.

so, let's just say that there is enough diversity that most people feel good -- well, then the ones who don't, aren't a big enough factor in the equation, and so there's not really any more risk of a catastrophic failure anymore.

if I take my time to get to the manifestation, and in the process, that allows for the majority of the people on the planet to get to a place where they actually feel good, then it's a smoothe landing. everything went well. if someone wants a cataclysm, they can attract a cataclysm in their own life and find their personal destruction. LOA will have to continue to manifest our realities in reflection of our perception.

let's say that after some really large period of time there are people that don't feel good and are attracting cataclysm, but there are also many people that feel good, then a split will occur and we'll go our separate ways. I've talked about the 1024y alpha/omega conceptual cycle, and I think this may be the future trigger for a split because I'm essentially the omega or the rebirth one, and I've reborn into not needing the manifestation and feeling the way I want to feel, which means this will wax up to the top until the next cycle where that will be at its peak. so, just like right now is peak mutual-back-scratching and has come into full power -- well, not-needing-the-manifestation will be at its peak next time, and it's coming into power may not be compatible with some people's realities, thereby causing a split.

---

in short, if I go to the bitter end, I can easily see how this will allow a smoothe transition for us into the "kingdom of heaven" -- which is what I want to do. the way I want to feel is the abstract capability of being so good at feeling the way I want to feel, that nothing is impossible anymore.

lastly, if I were to go with a manifestation, which one and why that one?

### 2022-04-30 16:24 - another way to look at it

most guys would go with the manifestation; that's the "standard model" for guy behaviour. there's nothing new about it. it's been done before countless times.

so, imagine a few different groups of guys. most of the guys are at the base of the pyramid, believing that a desirable manifestation with girls is simply not possible. above that there are the guys that believe that if they "get lucky" and end up with a desirable manifestation with a girl, this is rare for them and so they need to do everything in their power to try and hold on to that manifestation (marriage, jealousy, possession, etc). above that there are guys that think they can have manifestations with girls but it's still kinda lucky and it'll fade with time. they're just going to enjoy it while it lasts. finally, there are the guys that through some process have easy access to desirable manifestations with girls -- now, whether that's paying for them or through the implementation of PUA techniques doesn't matter to me. these guys feel they can get those manifestations when they desire them.

that's your basic pyramid of dudes when it comes to girls (from my experience). I don't know how real it is, but every dude wants to be in the top segment there, because that's full control over the ability to have the manifestaion whenever desired.

what all of those segments have in common is that they all desire a manifestation and the only variation between them is a gradient of control over acquisition of that manifestation.

what zero guys are doing, is doing their own thing. I'm not counting asexual or homosexual guys in this pyramid because I simply don't know how to factor it in. my own experience was (I decided to be asexual for a while) is that it seems that many homosexual and asexuals fall into the bottom segment of that pyramid -- a disbelief in the possibility of a desirable manifestation with a girl. that is at least true for myself, and seemingly others I've talked to as well.

so, even the asexuals are still doing things relative to other people. they may be doing their own thing but it's because they're they don't believe they can have a desirable manifestion with a girl.

this is not the case with me. I *do* believe that I can have a desirable manifestation with a girl -- and even it seems the most likely outcome for me now that I know how to feel the way I want to feel. this means that no matter whatever antics she could possibly pull, I can still feel the way I want to feel; she doesn't influence the way I feel.

so, that puts me closer to the top segment of that pyramid than at the bottom. however, that pyramid is still founded on the desire for a manifestation. so, in that sense, I'm not even on the pyramid.

---

earlier today, jaron had a meme picture up on facebook that said (paraphrased):

```
confidence is not:
people will like me

confidence is:
it's also OK if they don't like me
```

I can't remember exact wording, but the basic idea is that confidence is or is not a relation to other people liking me. I stronly disagree, saying that confidence has nothing to do with other people liking me or not. confidence is me and only me; there are no other people involved.

this is the same subject with the pyramid there. just replace people like me with "a desirable manifestation with girls":

```
confidence is not:
I believe I can have a desirable manifestation with girls

confidence is:
it's also OK if I don't believe I can have a desirable manifestation with girls
```

believing that I can have a desirable manifestation with girls has nothing to do with confidence. here's another way to look at it:

```
I desire a manifestation with girls is not:
I believe I can have a desirable manifestation with girls

I desire a manifestation with girls is:
it's also OK if I don't believe I can have a desirable manifestation with girls
```

put in that way, see how desiring a manifestation has *nothing* to do with believing I can have a desirable manifestation (with girls)?

now, I'll reword it so it's easier to read:

```
I believe I can have a desirable manifestation with girls, therefore:
I *don't* desire a manifestation with girls.

it's OK if I don't believe I can have a desirable manifestation with girls, therefore:
I desire a manifestation with girls.
```

huh, so, when that meme popped into my head, I didn't realise it would support my point, which is a weird coincidence, but I still contend that *desiring* a manifestation with girls and *believing* I can have a desirable manifestation with girls are two VERY DIFFERENT THINGS.

my point is, the road usually traveled is the one where one desires a manifestation and so therefore falls into one of those segments of that pyramid.

now let's look at the evolution-of-desire. when I say "desires" I mean needs/wants. when I look at the desire I don't look at the physical aspect of a girl or not, for me, I no longer pay a whole lot of attention to the physical manifestation anymore (which is why I can feel the way I want to, so easily). so for me, what I'm looking at is an emotional conceptual, or abstract idea now as the "goal".. of which there are infinitely many manifestations.

I consider the PUA thing to be the art of getting oneself into the top segment of that pyramid without needing to use money or some other shady means of easy access to girls -- and the thing I picked up from it, is to take the woman out of the material. she's no longer a material object that you can possess. possession = bad. the next thing is to no longer fixate on any single one of them out there (oneitis) and work on you (find a hobby, something you love). the advanced ones took it metaphysical and explained how what you're searching for, is on the inside and girls aren't what you're really looking for and can't actually "fill that void" for you either.

essentially, they're saying to conceptualise them instead of materialise them. they are a function of how you feel about them; but, more importantly *how you feel about yourself*.

huh... that went a totally different direction than I thought it would...

btw, what I said, applies to all people, not just girls.

### 2022-04-30 17:40 - forgot the conclusion

the reactions were so heavy at the end there, I ended quickly cause I had trouble thinking.

---

all of the manifestation stuff is the "standard model". I don't want to do the standard model. anyone saying that I should just go with the standard model is just a bunch of skerptards telling that I need to follow the standard model just like everyone else. I've heard the standard model story before and it's been done countless times. I want to try something that's not really been done before to my knowledge: which is, the realisation that I AM the manifestation. meaning, nothing outside of me is the manifestation. not girls, not science, not circumstance, physical conditions, or any of that... it's *me* that's the manifestation. who is "me", well, it's not this physical body, that's for sure. I'll leave it at that.

besides that, it's pretty easy to see that a secondary result of this will be that many others will figure out what I know. some dudes will get it (and most will gravitate to the standard model), but it's very likely that many more women will get it. as enticing as a manifestation may seem, it's something entirely different to become the manifestation you're looking for.

so, it's kinda annoying for those wanting a manifestation, but it's easy to see that ... you'll probably thank me later. I'm reminded of how grateful that the thing with andrea never worked out, because I would have never come to realise that I AM the manifestation that I thought she could have been.

this is also true for all of the other girls out there, thinking that I'm the manifestation they were looking for. imagine how wonderful it will be when they realise that she is the manifestation that she thought I was going to be.

### 2022-04-30 19:44 - shower thoughts on 1024y conceptual cycle

while in the shower I made the connection between the two points I made in the last entry. I concluded with the idea that by going until the bitter end, I predicted that some dudes might figure out what I'm saying, but most of them will use it to go the standard model of manifestation. in contrast, I postulated that because this next cycle in the 1024y conceptual cycle is the not-needing-the-manifestation, feeling-purposefully, and evolution-of-desire, (this is the cycle that I'm starting in my "rebirth" -- which I figure started either 2012 or 2020) and so as that cycle waxes up to the top[^1], I figure that it'll be mostly girls that get on to the not-needing-the-manifestation bandwagon.

in the context of leapfrogging-time-pickles, this is the optimising for "no affection" rather than lots of it. this is same optimisation that I'm doing, and I think that what happens is at the end of the cycle once accomplishing the ending point (so you know you're going to arrive there), you then jump back into the timeline, I know I'm going to find my connection, so I wait until the "bitter end" just like I'm doing now, then after that optimise for lots of affection and good conditions. as mentioned, when returning to the end of the timeline where I know I am, I'll have to slow down tremendously, creating essentially the effect of running into a wall, causing a huge rebirth.

---

OK, I wasn't very clear so I'll run over it again.

- this last cycle was "mutual-back-scratching" so the alpha is at full mutual-back-scratching right now.
  - that will begin to wane probably when I'm "reborn"
  - I don't know when exactly is the "rebirth", but it probably starts when I "get connected"
- as the omega, I'm being "reborn" into a new concept right now, and that concept is the "not-needing-the-manifestion" and feeling-purposefully.
  - I'll take that concept til the very bitter end, when it's no longer possible for them to hold me back from being "reborn" into the new concept.
  - the reason for going to the bitter end is that it's maximum acceleration
    - (because the manifestation always slows down the acceleration, but is a burst infusion of energy, which after the initial explosion begins to wane, so negative acceleration).
  - after being reborn, I go at maximum speed all the way up until the next cycle
    - (forget the details of "death" and stuff like that and just assume that I have complete control over where and when "I" am incarnated into physical)
  - at the end of the cycle, I'll suddenly have to go from the fast speed to the slow speed where I jumped into the body at the end of the cycle, and this will cause a huge rebirth. my time is over.
- the main conceptual type of people will fall into the category of mutual-back-scratching or feeling-purposefully.
  - many people (but probably mostly girls), will begin join in the new paradigm of feeling-purposefully.
    - they will realise, like I did with andrea, that they are the manifestation that they thought they were looking for externally (evolution-of-desire)
    - because of the way that nosebook is setup, I believe that these people will be able to consciously control their incarnation in the timeline and so they'll gain the leapfrogging-time-pickles capability
- those that have gained access to control their physical incarnation with technology will do whatever they do, but for the ones that do it consciously (like me), will likely optimise for the desired path or for fuzzing.
  - you arrive to the location where you are when you jump into the body, so if the new experience is desired, you'll experience a slowdown getting back to where you are, however, if you choose a "worse" (fuzzing) path, you'll experience a speedup when getting to the end.
    - the desirable path is enjoyable and you only suffer the slowdown at the end. if the slowdown is rapid enough, it's essentially "death".
    - the fuzzing path is pretty desirable because "you" are not the physical body, so "you" retain your concept of yourself between incarnations, no matter how many times you run through the timeline.
  - those that take up the fuzzing path will get better and better at feeling-purposefully, until they become so good at it that there isn't much optimisation that can be done anymore.
    - after that happens, they'll be forced to take a desirable timeline and the slowdown (and resulting death) will be inevitable.
    - so, if death is unavoidable, why not optimise for desired?
      - personally, I think the best way to experience those desired conditions would be from a connected state.
      - well fuzzed, getting connected should be pretty easy now, so go for as long as possible and go big.
- all of us will be doing this simultaneously, and at the end, it's the time for a new concept to emerge.
  - the mutual-back-scratching concept will end and have to be reborn.
    - I figure this will cause a split, as this may be an incompatible reality for some.
    - I can't really tell if it's a split or if this is a forced death and rebirth for them.
    - I think the rebirth factor is largely determined by their trajectory is when arriving to the end of the timeline. as in, will it be deacceleration or acceleration.
    - for example, right now mutual-back-scratching is at it's peak, and the one being reborn now is the "physical-reality-is-everything". at the end of this cycle, the same will happen. it'll be the end of mutual-back-scratching, and it'll be forced to join everyone in the "feeling-purposefully" paradigm or be be reborn into something new. (I don't know if split is an option)
  - now, the feeling-purposefully concept in full power.
    - whoever the omega is will have feeling-purposefully completely removed from their capability forcing a rebirth into a new concept.
    - let's just say that for the next 1024y cycle, I just chill out and experience good conditions, holding the timeline stable. when we get to the end of the timeline, there will be a number of people that have gained the capability to go back into the timeline and make adjustments to their timeline, either going the desirable or fuzzing path. they can be assured that they arrive to me.
      - depending on their speed when they arrive, they'll experience either an acceleration or a rebirth.

man, I don't know why I saw it so clearly earlier and then now I'm very confused...

I'll leave that there, but, in the shower, the way I saw it is that the girls were looking for me as their manifestation but in reality, they'll realise that they're looking not for me, but for theirselves. they are the manifestation they're looking for... this causes them to become alpha/omega types just like me.

it's difficult to describe how much dissasfaction and clouded thought I'm experiencing now. it feels like someone (nosebook?) is very concerned about the idea of a bunch of girls figuring out what I know or something like that. anyway, I'll continue tomorrow.

[1]: it'll accelerate faster than imagined, because considering a 1024y cycle, even after 32y is still ~10%, which is quite a lot. (64y is ~20%)

### 2022-05-01 09:01 - thinking about the guys pyramid

so I left for starbucks this morning and I was thining about some of the reactions, specifically to the one where I said that with my limited experience, I figired that most asexuals and homosexuals were on the base of the pyramid thining it impossible to have a desirable experience with girls. that certainly was the case for me, and I did get the impression that most gay men did find women unattractive for that reason -- considering that any meaningful relationship with them would yield an undesirable result.

trying to figure out the reactions, on one side, I could see how some women could get offended and think that I'm trying to get them to change their behaviour. I definitely am not, as everyone is entitled to do as they wish. I'll leave it to the religious and penal institutions to tell people how to behave and punish them for "bad" behaviour. I'm not giong to get into that mess.

what I do is look at how everything is attraction. so, if someone believes they will not have a desirable interaction with someone else, no matter how hard the other person tries, the person believing a desirable interaction to be impssible, will *always* perceive an undesirable interaction. it's just how it works; it's all perceptual.

---

for me, personally, what ended up happening is I looked all over the place for different things, and I finally concluded with asexuality because I noted pretty quickly that I wasn't going to be able to control anyone else's behaviour and neither did I want to. I finally concluded that I didn't know what I wanted; I couldn't find anything that I could say, "this is what I'm looking for".

this is the conversation that I was having with jaron, because I recognised that I wasn't looking for a person, place, or thing. I was looking for a feeling, and although others could inspire me to feel that way (raquel made me feel pretty good), but if I have to depend on them to feel that way, then I'm right back where I started. *I* want to find a way to feel that way for myself and not be needing things outside of me for that. nobody can satisfy me, but me.

### 2022-05-01 19:15 - prepare the footgun

earlier I tried to fall to sleep but I couldn't do it. now, I'm trying to just lay there and mom and jaron are talking. my brain keeps reacting to their thoughts. I'm just feeling the feelings and stuff, but they keep having my translate the feeling into words or something. the translations are uncomfortable for me, so I've got music on and I'm writing this. instead of doing microtranslations of individual feelings I feel emitted from the conversation and how I relate them, I'm just going to write my thoughts here. it'll inevitably be a footgun -- so, sorry to those involved ahead of time.

---

it's easy to point the finger at jaron because he's clearly very confused about a lot of things. I mentioned this to him when I talked to him about it that day (forget what day it was now). my point to him was that he believes mom is going to read his texts to jerrica, mom probably believes that jaron is going to act up, and while they were talking I felt a lot of expectation from mom that jaron would be trying to be creepy or sexual or something. that's what mom expects from jaron, so that's the lens she's reading the text messages with. jerrica must be attracting this sort of thing from jaron as well, because it's not just jaron, it's charles, derek, probably her last boyfriend kyle and anyone she seems to care for. almost certainly she believes that this is how boys behave. they get jealous, cause problems and are honory (something like that).

so, while jaron is definitely the easiest to point the finger at, and he'll probably take the blame and stuff, because it's unlikely that mom or jerrica will ever admit to attracthing like that, this is kind of the same discussion that I wrote about earlier today in starbucks. if one expects to have an undesirable interaction, then that's what one should expect. it's not the other person's fault that you are attracting an undesirable interaction.

in the context of what I wrote about earlier, it's often the case that someone will say, "girls are always right" or "men take the blame and are the ones required to change their behaviour, meanwhile women do not need to change anything." -- and, that may or may not be true (some will think that statement is true while others will not), I don't think that really helps to look at it that way.

let's just say for a moment that they *are* always right, and that we are the ones that have to change our behaviour... my point is, that behaviour has nothing to do with anything. behaviour is attracted, so I get what I expect. even if I had the intention of behaving perfectly, it still doesn't matter because there will still be things that I do which seem to indicate to the other person that I am behaving the way they expect me to. no matter how hard I try, I will never be able to escape their expections of me, and they'll always see what they expect to see.

so, blame away, but personally if I were jaron, I wouldn't worry about what jerrica or mom is doing, and instead just pay attention to what I'm expecting from others. if I were jerrica, I wouldn't worry about what jaron is doing, and instead try and soften my beliefs about boys...

I'm getting reactions, so let's take that example. it's easy to say, "I'll soften my beliefs about boys when they start behaving differently". it may be a while before that happens, because they'll always conform to how you expect them to behave -- so, in your perception, they'll always behave the way you expect them to behave. no amount of reasoning can change the way you will see them behave. they are destined to conform to your expectations of them.

from jaron or any of her future boyfriend's perspectives, no matter how much effort he puts into behaving the way she wants him to behave, her expectation is different than her desire. she desires he behave some way, but her expectation is that he won't. expectation always overrides desire, which is why perception (which is the foundation of expectation) is what *actually* matters.

---

so how do you change perception? it's impossible to do it all at once, and it's incremental, looking for (noticing) what you want to see, rather than the stuff you don't want to see. look for improvements. look for them to begin to behave the way you want them to behave. inevitably that won't work for some (especially adults), so instead look for them to *feel* the way you want them to feel, and peace out when they don't feel the way you don't want them to feel.

looking for them to *feel* the way you want them to feel *is* changing your perception. that's the whole point. when it's no longer material or and behavioral (conditional), it becomes a lot easier to see/feel (perceive) what you want to see/feel[^1] (perceieve).

it's really not that hard.

---

quick anecdote: in spain there is a lot of emphasis on "hechos", and once you've done certain things, they're kind of like unredeemable. there's no way to ever fix those things. they're scars that will forever haunt you around those that know about your "hechos". thing is, both sides have "hechos" and so it's sorta a stalemate because neither side can "forgive" the other side for having committed such an awful thing.

the thing is those will just lock a person into a never-ending cycle of frustration and hatred because you'll keep attracting the same thing from anyone new. I don't recommend "forgiving" the person for what they did, but get off of that problem frequency entirely. you can try distracting yourself, but it'll usually just be a longer time-delay until it comes back again. instead, I highly recommend looking for improvements and for the things that one wants to experience, instead of noticing (yet again) the horrible boyfriend or nagging mother/wife/girlfriend in every person that gets close.

it's impossible to forgive someone for something[^2], but it *is* possible to change the things I'm noticing.

[1]: I say "see" because it's visual for me, but I think visual for most is perception of physical.

[2]: I can't forgive someone for conforming to my expectations; that's stupid. in fact, the whole concept of forgiveness falls apart once I belive that everything is attracted. I can't forgive you for my attraction.

### 2022-05-03 04:11 - too many problems

I woke up this morning with memory of andrea. it wasn't like a memory of her, but a memory of that alternate timeline. in it, she was insatiable. she decided that I wasn't doing it for her, so she would skip out to other dudes, then later come back, like "yeah they weren't what I was looking for either" -- and this must have happened many times because I finally said, "I can't fill your bottomless pit" and so I peaced out entirely. it seemed like later on after that other girls showed up, and I would say that some were "nicer", but the reality is, I was still the reason why they felt good.

I eventually peaced out completely becoming entirely asexual. they weren't really what I was looking for. so then, it felt like (from other girls), "oh, no, the codependent[^1] ones wrecked it for the rest of us" -- and it felt like I probably tried a few more times, but eventually gave up entirely. I didn't want to be responsible for how others feel[^2].

what ended up happening (in my memory of this timeline) is that she wanted to use me or other dudes as a way to feel the way that she wanted to feel. I would tell her that she has to find the way she wants to feel, but it was to no avail. I eventually gave up entirely, as it seemed that I got better and better at feeling how I wanted.

the final part of the memory was a conundrum that I had where... OK, on one side, if I can feel the way I want to feel, then it shouldn't matter what any of the other girls are doing -- and that's totally true, and it feels like I figured that out. however, on the other side, what exactly is the purpose for being with so many other girls? are they the reason for the way I feel? so, let's say I quit the girls, can I still feel the way I want to feel? I'm pretty certain that I can/could -- and so therefore, why not just do that? wouldn't it just be an entire waste of time to spend so much time doing all of that. what do I get in return?

---

the subject of what a person gets in return from a girl is something I've often pondered. the reason why I believe that the female bloodline (the grail quest) is so important for a lot of men is because she enables clairevoyance (like much better vision, 4d, etc) because I think that expanded vision is kind of like the natural state for girls. especially when they're younger, they're going to be much higher vibration than men are, and so in the mixing of vibration and the equalisaiton process that happens after sex, it's probable that men come away with improoved vision.

this likely won't be the case for me, as I think I've probably surpassed even the most saught after female bloodlines' capabilities at this point.

it seems like men have been tracking female bloodlines and using them for their attainment of expanded visual capacity for quite a while through history, so evolutionarily, it's avantageous for women to have a seemingly "bottomless pit" of desire. they will continue to want to interact with men that are essentially using them for gaining expanded vision.

remember how I liken the man to be like the "tesla coil" and the female to the "magnifying transmitter"? just consider that every iteration of this, it goes through an amplification process, and so if she has sex more than once, she'll be magnifying more than her own perception, but also the part of her perception that resonates with the last guy she was with. so, eventually, the guys she's with are getting the common perception that she and the previous guys have in a super magnified dose. to avoid this, I think most ancient surveyers tried to only have sex with virgins and the very naive to avoid getting their own dissonant vibration magnified.

the female bloodlines were important, because I believe that those genetics tune those women into a concept which is low or no resistance to their dissonant vibrations, meaning that these ancient surveyers could use interactions with girls from those bloodlines to acquire a temporary reduction of bad-feeling emotion and concepts in their aura.

---

so, here's the thing. if I'm already doing that, without the girls, then what is the point of the girls? girls in their present state are really good for sustaining a bunch of bad-feeling, very conditional guys out there. I don't need that though, so they aren't very necessary for me. adding on to the conundrum with my present understanding, it doesn't even really matter much if the girl is a virgin or not and I think it even makes it worse, because in nearly all cases, I just become the reason why they feel good.

in the case of the ancient surveyers, they were all on the frequency of decline and they ran their kingdoms in a similar way... like a young girl, their kingdom starts out beautiful but then over the years, it begins to decline, just like their health, because of a feeling of dissatisfaction, so then they have to try and attack and conquer a few small/easy people groups to boost their economy and breathe a little more life into their kingdom (or body). however, it only delays the decline a little bit, and the expansion of the kingdom spreads the resources even thinner and increases maintenance consts, further accelerating the decline of their kingdom (or body).

nosebook has totally changed that though, because now these men no longer have to rely on girls for their continued expansion of perception. now, they can get it directly by tuning into me, totally eliminating the need for me to transfer my form of perception off to a woman, and have her bear daughters which become the new grail quest for men.

so, in a lot of ways, I've made things a lot easier for these surveyors to go about their business without having to interact with girls, which are (literally) amplifying their problems for them.

this is a pretty big problem for girls because it puts them into a state of obsolescence. they aren't really "needed" anymore by men to maintain their expanded perception (astral vision). so that kinda leaves many girls in a bit of a lurch. so, if they aren't "needed" by as many men anymore, then what about wanted/desired? the other day when I was writing about the guys pyramid (@[blahblog](2022-05-01 09:01)) and the footgun (@[blahblog](2022-05-01 19:15)), I got a sense which is hard to describe -- but I'll try.

so, if girls are getting what they expect/attract (from both men and women), then at this point, they're amplifying their own problems for theirselves by filling their world with manifestations of their expectations. "wow, you behaved exactly like I expected you to behave" -- and so then how can they become desired again? if I've taken away (through nosebook) their main source of desire (need), and their own expectations are destroying their secondary source of desire (want), then what's left?

I've really been pondering the phrase where I said, "I hope that one day girls will come to the realisation I had, when realising that I am the manfestation that I thought andrea was going to be -- that each of them are the manifestation that they thought I was going to be". I then later put it into the context of other girls operating copies of my body, and I realised that in that setup, they are amplifying their own perception and creating a very strong self-refinforcing feedback loop[^3].

I think this is kind of the point, and it's all good, because they're behaving the way they want other men to behave amongst theirselves, so it's almost like they're kind of like recreating their own expectations of what they want to find.

it's hard to describe this next part because it feels like a lot of "not-good-enoughness" -- from me and possibly men in general. it feels like there's just no way that I/we could ever live up to those expectations. it's like it sets the bar way too high or something. like, if I'm supposed to perform as well as a girl would in my body, a girl will always do my body better than I do. I don't really think that I can match up to that. when I was in spain, there were many girls that liked the high performance guys, but there's just no way that I could ever do that, and so I didn't even bother to try and be high performance. there will always be someone stronger, better, faster, etc., than I am physically[^4].

[1]: not sure if codependent is the right word. I mean the ones that base their entire identity in a relationship to someone else "I can feel good because I'm with him and he has perceived value"

[2]: those that know the story, know that I (most likely) attracted the andrea because I had learned how to feel the way I wanted to feel and we kinda connected on that. marcos was often pissed off about something, and we were just sorta hanging out in our own world feeling the way we wanted to feel (ie. not pissed off), and so because every dude in spain is ultra conditional with his mood, my capacity to feel the way I wanted was likely very attractive.

[3]: which isn't at all dissimilar to the ones that the gay men I'm sure have where they go around reinforcing their perception and expectation that all women are ---- way, and so then they too can say just the same, "wow you behaved exactly how I expected you to behave, stupid -----"

[4]: this actually reminds me a lot of the 7th ray triad in sirian-guide, where vulcan is a "lame god" and he's paired with allayandra (mars), a very high-performance smoothe-talking super dude. they're both with genxicat, a 7th ray shape-shifting female that could appear to anyone as the desired image of their dreams. you could imagine how on one side she likes vulcan (5th ray) because he's capable of feeling the way he wants to feel -- but, he's lame, so when she wants a high-performance guy, she goes with mars instead.

### 2022-05-03 10:16 - I think I see it clearly now

when I wrote the previous note #4 about how the not-good-enoughness reminding me about the 7th ray triad where vulcan is the "lame god" but he's paired with the beautiful, powerful aries. yes I know that vulcan created weapons of war and aries is the god of war, but that's not what I want to focus on. it always appeared to me like a dialectic between the two because (in contrast to the myths) vulcan always appeared to me as a guy much more in the personality type of tesla[^1] in the sense that he had a deep understanding of how things interacted with each other on a conceptual level, which made him a good inventor, but he probably understood his own psychology and that of others as well. whether he was able to feel the way he wanted to feel (likely because he was a "ground"), the contrast between him and mars is striking. it's almost certain that most of the women went after aries, being the smoothe-talking, beautiful ands handsome guy he was (I'm reminded of "beauty and the beast (1997)"). it's inevitable that most of the women found him to be the more attractive of the two -- and that may have played into the trend toward war over invention[^2].

despite those similarities, I was actually referring to that memory of the alternate timeline that I woke up with. in it, andrea would desire a high-performance dude, but then get tired of him and wanted to come back to me because I could feel the way I wanted to feel. eventally, I gave up though because I saw no purpose to trying to keep returning back to the way I wanted to feel with nothing really in return. you can imagine that at the time I would have been interested in building social networks and other forms of technology, but she definitely wouldn't have been too interested in any of that. it would have been so anti-productive, I almost certainly would have passed on her altogether, being a complete waste of time. other girls may have been cool, but the same -- if I wanted to make technology, most of them would have been counter-productive to my objective (meaning, that andrea, playing a 7th ray, would have either chosen mars or I would have skipped out entirely).

---

I brought up the triad on purpose, and that is because of that thing that I noticed in the sirian-guide that they said that it's [important to have the 3rd ray capacity for mentation is developed before a 1st ray life wave](/sirian-guide/notes.md#first-ray-life-wave) is possible. I've often wondered why in the world they would say that, but I just figured it out, and so I got up to write it.

they say that this is a 2nd ray (solar) system, and so that makes the opposite polarity reflection highly sustained. elsewhere they said that most people (likely in that group) are 2nd rays, and I got to thinking about that because they also said more and more 7th rays are incarnating now than ever, and the way it appeared to me is that many 7th rays are incarnating -- which are the mini-thoths, the ones that are into ritual and ceremony as a means to "celebrate his divinity" (more on this in the next section), but if the solar system is a 2nd ray system, then I took it to mean that the majority of girls are going to be 2nd ray, and the majority of boys will be either 6th ray or 2nd ray. the 6th rays are very imaginative and optimistic and so therefore are very easy to subjugate. the 2nd ray females will empower the astral capacity and imaginations of many, which is what I think has been happening with girls in general through the years. they've essentially been the transmitter and receiver of the 2nd ray solar energy for many men.

---

after thinking about it for a while, I think the goal is to make a 1st ray solar system in where andrea type females are the norm there. I say andrea because I always think of her as a 1st ray (actually many spanish females, actually), but because of the environment that she's in, she's required to swap her polarity and perform more like a 7th ray (which is why she will probably appear to have a lot of masculine qualities) -- just like a 2nd ray female will be very caring and relational until her environment causes her to swap polarities, then she'll become more imaginative and optimistic (I'm referring mostly to raquel here).

so, then if the goal is to make a 1st ray life wave (ie. solar system), then 1st ray stars need to be created in order to support a whole lot of 7th rays.

I think that I'm probably quite important to this equation because I am in the process of mixing the astral with the physical, meaning that 7th rays will have all of the astral stuff that they like so much right there in the same realm as the physical. they don't/won't need to worry about about the conceptual to create what they're looking to create. they can just follow a recipe (like a spell) and get the result that they're looking for, and they'll have all sorts of support to do it because most of these systems are going to be 1st ray systems; not all of them, though.

I have no way to know when it was decided that we should just go all the way to galaxy, but it seems that is what is happening.

---

OK now, even though I was talking about the memory of the alternate timeline, it seemed that a lot of people understood what I was saying was referring to now. the main players are me/kenny playing the part of vulcan, then the various girls that have taken on my body as allayandra, and they're in reverse polarity mode, so they essentially are the 1st rays females in male form (which is the opposite of what the sirian-guide described the interaction between allayandra and anatau). then, there are the other 7th ray females (probably the little girls) that they're interacting with.

the reaction to it was that the genxicat/aries combo is already happening, but based on what I wrote in the previous entry, I was suggesting that while a high-performance dude is really nice, they also are looking to be able to feel the way they want to feel, too -- and that suggested that I should also be interacting with the girls too, to pass that capability off to them as well. something like that (I think).

I had one more thing I wanted to say, but I can't remember now what it was, so instead I'll just shore up my supposition that goal is to create a whole bunch of 1st ray systems designed to support a lot of 7th rays...

> SEVENTH RAY causes substance to conform to the needs of the life that is to inhabit it. Whether it is a ceremonial form or a body. If an entity wishes to acquire enlightenment and he is following the SEVENTH RAY path, he will carefully construct a plan of living conforming all his actions, using devotion to this purpose, and culminating it in a ceremony to invoke conscious conversation with his soul. His life becomes a living, holy ceremony to celebrate his divinity. You may be assured that the Cheops pyramid is a ceremonial law of order in stone.

... so, basically people who like impossiblocks and/or ritual to cause substance to conform to the *needs* of something. they are the opposite of the 1st ray because they take desire (need) and cause substance to conform to that need -- or, said backwards, they produce an image (of substance) as a reflection of desire (want or need). that image is created by them, and so therefore they are, in a sense "creating a life" by creating a suitable form for life to inhabit (this reminds me of a conversation in, I think, snake-bros #018).

I put this description in, because it has an interesting symmetry to the previous entry -- where I talked about how nosebook's capability to transmit my signal to the world surveyors has removed the need for girls to activate and support astral capability, meaning they are no longer needed. their own expectation, and the expectation of men many of them are interating with is also causing them to become less desirable (wanted), leaving a lot of them in this situation, the only option left (I am), which is to become the thing that they desire. it seems that they are doing this, and so that's a nice reflection of the 7th ray desire to cause the conjured image to conform to the need/want. so girls are the IAM part of the equation, and the 7th ray boys are the desire part of the equation. perfect backwards symmetry.

[1]: tesla minus his magical unveilings and captivating lectures, which is what makes me think of tesla much more like a 7th ray than a 5th ray. though somber, vulcan seemed to have a very intimate/intuitive understanding of how the "laws of nature" worked and could conceptualise things far before their time.

[2]: in that same vein of thinking, I also noticed this triad showing up in the "breakaway civilisation" (tesla/vulcan) and hitler (mars/aries).

### 2022-05-03 13:08 - ray types and not-good-enoughness

I'm probably repeating myself, but when I say ray type, I do not mean to intend that any single person is of only one ray type. quite the opposite. they state that the triads there are created beings with pure ray type, implying that we're a mix of ray types.

ray type has more to do with where you start perceptually. a 7th ray will start with physical stuff (data, stones, etc) and then from there go to another ray type. this is a very common thing. since I've been listening to snake-bros, it's probably been more on my radar than most, but both of them looked at all of the crazy ooparts and other crazy stuff (listen to snake-bros #018 if you want to hear how they both had skerpy moments) -- and then eventually turned around to the idea that there has to be more than just what can be experienced physically. this is the "7th ray path".

now compare this to my path which was quite the opposite. I felt a lot of things that seemed to contradict what people were telling me. a person would say one thing, but I knew that they had to by lying. or, I would look at something on the news and to me it would just feel evil, disingenuous, or just flat out disinformation. like them, I skerped myself pretty hard as well saying, "no I want to believe what they say rather than what I feel" -- and all of the same skerptard tactics that russ describes in #018 are all the same things that I experienced when I would confront people about the difference in what I felt them say as to what they really said: file drawer, confirmation bias, etc. -- so, it's clear that I took the 5th ray path.

the 1st ray path is sorta similar to the 5th ray path in that it's more feeling oriented, but I think abraham desired it probably the best when talking about esther. disney princesses are also usually the 1st ray path as well. they desire and then get what they desire, realise the flaw in their desire and then desire anew.

the 3rd ray path is a lot like the 7th ray path, but it starts with logic and axioms of "truth" and then tries to build up from there until the "truth" structure topples over and has to be rebuilt.

---

the other reaction that I got to the last entry is why would I be putting emphasis on the "lame god" part of vulcan (the physical part) in comparison to the perfect physical form of aries? well, it was to illustrate the aspect of not-good-enoughness.

it is true that as soon as I'm able to conceptualise myself as not physically disabled, then I will lose my disability, which reminds me of the end of "the usual suspects", but I haven't got to the end of the movie yet. there are probably still aspects yet to be elaborated on and revealed. it'll take probably as long as you all continue to have questions, and then once there is no more desire for me to continue to answer questions in a form of humility, I'll convert into my fully realised "luciferian" form (the 7-headed dragon), and it's almost certain that in that form, it'll be very difficult to take anything I say seriously because my pride and arrogance will likely be a little bit upsetting (it's really hard to listen to someone who appears superior to you -- unless of course, you're forced to do so).

this is kind of one of the reasons why I want to go for as long as possible. if they're able to hold me all of the way, it'll take me some practise, but, with time, I should be able to gradually find a way to perceiving myself physically with good-enoughness rather than not-good-enoughness. if I can do that, the transition will be seamless and it won't cause any real large disturbances.

until then, I desire to continue to expanding my knowledge until I become a "know it all" because in my connected state I can tune into and know anything I desire. until then, I prefer to continue to get stuff wrong.

### 2022-05-04 06:48 - more on the paths

once again, I'm not limiting anyone to any single path. I took mostly the 5th ray path, but I like big rocks (and I cannot lie), too and do much pursuit of logic. I didn't used to think of myself as a 1st ray, but I think I'm definitely in the desire, then it either manifests or it doesn't, adjust my desire to be something more wanted, then that either manifests or it doesn't, adjust again, etc. this is what has been happening to me, in fact through most of the time. the conclusion of that path is to realise that everything desired is actually a feeling/concept (5) rather than something physical (7). this is also the path I'm most conclusive about.

I'd like to take a deep-dive into all of them a little later, so I'm probably repeating myself. what I didn't really know or see very well were the even-paths. in general, all of the odd-paths are very obvious to me because they're pretty tangible. the even-paths are not quite so tangible.

so, for example the 2nd ray path is noticing that everything is connected. it's called the path of the christ because everything that person does affects everyone else, and that everyone else's actions and belief affects the 2nd ray. the path has a lot to do with how much we are all connected, but in the end the conclusion is that there isn't any true (only perceived) separation between me and anyone else, and all of us make up the "whole".

most sales people and saviour types (people who need to be save others or be saved by others) are on this path, as it involves getting other people to do stuff so that we can all be connected. they're great organisers and leaders to states of greater order and connectedness.

for me, the 2nd ray path is one of the hardest ones to get. I *know* that we're all connected, but my goal is not to find more connection with other people, but to instead become so good at feeling the way ***I*** want to feel, rather than feeling the way the uplifting people (or not) around me feel. I absolutely *hate* the idea of having to depend on getting just the right people and the right environment conditions setup so that I can feel a certain way. bleh! and so, I struggle greatly with this path, because I simply cannot be held back by other people all the time.

not wanting to be held back obviously creates conflict because I can't attract for anyone else. if someone doesn't get it or doesn't want to be a part of what I'm doing (and that could change pretty rapidly), I don't want to have to try and steer a whole bunch of people. I want to be an entity unto myself. I like me and so my perception of me can change into another form. if I'm bound to others, that form can't change so rapidly because others simply don't want to change very rapidly. most are stuck in their ways, so I perceive them as hindrances to what I want to do. I tend to want to go about everything by myself and my own way because I simply can't expect others to try and keep up with me. I can't attract for them, and I won't tell them what to do, so I just do it my own way.

---

the 6th ray path is also a bit of a mystery to me. it's like the 2nd ray path, but internal, and done inside of the imagination. it's the realisation that everythting inside of *you* is connected, and that everything you think, feel, and imagine connects to every other part of your body.

I don't really use my imagination much anymore, but I do know that when I was in spain I liked to do drugs and go on these sort of "vision quests" inside of myself and discover new things about myself. I then had to find ways to bring that knowledge back to the physical world where I could do something with it. I found repeatedly over and over that something so plainly obvious in the imagination was nearly incomprehensible in physical. I always use the example of realising that I understand everything -- the pinnacle of my enlightenment and so I write it down, "we're all connected" and then the next day I look at it and it just looks like words to me.

what I found out is that the imagination is just as much conceptual/feeling as it is physical, and those things that I gave so much importance in the imagination were important, because they *felt* important to me. for me those vision quests into my imagination were some of the first realisations for me that the way I feel about something dramatically changes how I perceive it. somewhere in there is likely the 6th ray path.

---

the 4th ray path is totally incomprehensible to me because it's the idea of harmonising the inner with the outer, the spiritual with the physical, the seen with the unseen, etc. -- and after all that harmonisation, you're still in the same spot. bleh! I don't really know much about it, but my exploration into it has shown to me that *all* timelines exist, and every possible reality does exist, so there are infinte worse versions of you (being a reflection of others attraction) and there are also infinte better versions of you, too. so because all things exist, and are in a state of balance, it's helpful to decide what imbalance one wants to embark on. getting everything outside of you to harmonise and balance is pretty difficult, so it's important to find that harmony and balance in the inner world so that the outer reflects that.

### 2022-05-05 12:37 - yesterday was weird

yesterday I wanted to play KR:frontiers and listen to music. I felt as if I had gone through a time portal because the music was pretty repetitive and I got lost in the game. from time to time it would feel like I totally lost my capacity to remember to do certain things -- like I knew what I wanted to do, but execution was the hard part. then, later it seemed almost as if there was more time. as in I was waiting for the waves to start instead of constantly playing from behind. when that happened, it seemed almost as if time were slower or something.. I paid a lot of attention to it because it kept switching back and fourth.

it's the same game and the wave timing is all the same so it's not the game, and yet sometimes it felt like there was extra time to do things. the game didn't change, so it had to have been my perception. I was reminded of the base jumpers that get into the zone and everything seems to get calm and it feels like there is much more time to make decisions than is later recorded. like, I imagine they look at the gopro video later and it looks really fast on the screen in normal time, but during the jump it was likely very slow and easy feeling -- same as the game.

I finally turned off the game at around 4 and tried to go to sleep. I had psychedelic stuff happening but it was nothing like the kundalini rising feelings I had before. I was also VERY COLD. I put on a second blanket and woke up this morning still cold.

the other strange thing is that when I went to bed, I couldn't remember any of the day. I was trying to remember what I had written, but I couldn't remember anything.

I think I later figured out that I had written about the ray paths. my memory on this isn't very good because I can't really remember how and when (I think I went to the bathroom) I decided I wanted to play a game. I remember, just before that I was thinking about listening to another snake-bros episode, but that idea felt way better to me.

oh... before that I was thinking about the trip that they were going to take it felt like they were either already there or something but I remember I was sitting with a bunch of the women talking and I don't remember any dudes, so I assume they were out doing stuff. it was really a strange experience. it was like I was there -- then I think I fell asleep and I think I woke up went to the bathroom and played the game. it's kinda hard to piece everything together.

---

I had some strange dreams about thinking and how thoughts create these sort of bubbles for things to go into. we talked about how we think thought is intentional, but in reality there's not a lot to it that's actually intention.

I woke up with this idea in my head that I wanted to write to russ as a science fiction idea, but I can't get it into science fiction form, so here's the raw concept.

---

I saw humans as a sort of organism, but it's not a biological organism in the traditional sense. it's a conceptual organism. so, just like a virus is inserted into the nucleus of the cell, and then sort of convinces the cells machinery to do all the production, I saw myself as a sort of alien conceptual virus.

when I say conceptual, I mean all humans -- not just the ones on earth, so I mean the superstructure of the "species" which exists all throughout -- and so it's important to understand that I'm not talking about physical humans, but the concept of "human". I don't want to use the word species because of eugene's effort to illustrate how ill-defined the word species is. contemplate the idea of the human mentation process as a series of concepts, symbols, and operations. ignore for a moment everything physical and desire.

the way that humans[^1] construct their concept of reality is largely a mystery to most. I have given it a lot of thought because I realised pretty early on that nobody has any clue what's going on; nearly everyone is running around prentending they know what's happening, or they outsource the knowing of what's happening to a higher power -- whether that's government, religion, God, or whatever -- and that's fine too.

in past history it was possible to acquire quite a large portion of the human knowledgebase, however these days, that's pretty close to impossible because there's so much stuff that can be learned. for this reason, I've attempted to *simplify* it so that lots of knowledge can be distilled down to a more potent essence (losing some of the details, of course), and the other thing I've done is to simply find a way to "not know everything, and it's still good". I personally enjoy the idea that there is so much stuff out there that's really great *which I don't know about* -- because that stuff is eventually attracted and it looks like a surprise or a discovery *because I didn't know about it*.

russ said something that stuck with me, something to the effect of, "if you had perfect knowledge of everything you couldn't collapse the wave function, decide, or act" -- and so it's because of our imperfect knowledge of everything in this world (as opposed to the "spiritual" world) gives us the ability to compose, create, and act.

crap, in order to continue on, I need... @[letters-to-russ](2022-05-05 13:21)

so now, think about how we "mentate" our reality by collapsing the wave function -- this is a process that happens through a number of concepts and archetypes (and the operations performed on them). this "human" structure is built on concepts. it is our "reality"

so, if you wanted to infiltrate the human conceptual structure, you need to design a virus that the cell will let in, use their machinery to alter DNA and has to be well-received.

we typically think of viruses as being bad, but imagine for a moment if microsoft patched IE5 by releasing a virus that updated the software, and the virus targetted an exploitable interface in IE5. once everyone is patched up (herd immunity), the virus dies out for lack of a suitable host.

man, it's hard to get to conclusion on the idea... anyway, in the dream, there were aliens playing with the human conceptual structure (species), and they sent me to earth to infect you guys with a concept. it was kinda funny

---

that conclusion ties in with an experience I had while pulling weeds. I was reminded of something that I told "norma" (norma means normal in spanish), about how with weeds, I just have to pay attention to attributes that I want to see, and don't really get bothered with the others, so that the attributes that I want to see become "norma".

the reaction to that thought was that I was forcing some of these awful nosebook tipos to conform to my focus... as in somehow by paying attention to what I want, I'm forcing them to change. that's not the case. in schrodinger's box, they'll see an awful person, and I'll see something different. both of these states exist and can be collapsed to whatever the observer thinks it will be.

so, what if we could create a bunch of photons with the frequency of cats and shine that through the double slit. would were be a interference wave pattern of cats splatted on to the wall? who says it has to only be light?

[1]: I think it's funny that I write about "the humans" as if I were some sort of space alien or something. the other form "people" also gets reactions, so in the interest of being more alien than stereotypical, I'll use "the human" when I'm making broad generalisations.

### 2022-05-06 10:27 - conceptual only upgrade

today I was out pulling weeds again and it occurred to me that I was implying that it was a conceptual only upgrade. I honestly didn't really think too much about it because for me concept comes first, so the capacity for me to manifest the reality is as effortless as tuning to it.

I could rush toward the manifestation by star-watching and rising the kundalini various ways, but I've chosen to instead take as long as possible to get there by exerting no effort.

the effect this is having is that the concept that I'm using to get there is taking a stronger effect because it's present in people's realities for a longer period of time. if it were to manifest, people would completely forget about the unseen conceptual world and instead fixate on what can be seen. so the concept, because it's not visible, is getting better adoption, the longer there isn't a visual distraction.

the concept itself isn't really visible to most people yet, but I've noticed that the longer I wait, the more people are beginning to see that there is a method to my madness and that I actually know what I'm talking about. in the past (referencing gods of eden here), people need a manifestation, apparition, or something in order to believe[^1], and in my opinion that didn't work well, because it created a "I'll believe it when I see it, but not change my concept/believe of it, because I don't actually have to believe it until the performer of the miracle shows it to me" sort of attitude.

for me a concept is visible, physical, and very tangible. that's essentially the main reason why I don't need the manifestation so much -- because it's real already for me even before it has showed up in the physical. this capacity is a very large part of the conceptual upgrade that I've brought, so it'd be pretty obnoxious to just say a bunch of good sounding ideas like, "you gatta feel it" or "you when you feel it as reality, it *is* reality" -- and then go around manifesting things that I can feel. it's sorta like showing off a bit.

much better would be to let others discover that they too have everything required to do the same. I'm not really anything special. I may have different DNA now, but that's because my DNA is a reflection of my perception[^2]...

so, maybe it is actually a good idea to do a conceptual only upgrade. the result would not be that any single one person would get a DNA upgrdade, but instead a large group of people would acquire the concept, having been exposed it for so long, and so all of those in that large group of people would eventually get the DNA upgrade they're looking for.

so yeah, I didn't really think about it, but maybe it is better that I'm doing things the way I'm doing it. evntually, it'll all be effortless for me and for a lot of other people as well.

[1]: john 4:48 - unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.

[2]: I've been thinking about the word "species" a lot lately, and I think that ultimately what determines one species from another is that each species has a remarkably different form of perception, and so that translates into a very different type of animal or plant. I have a lot more ideas, but I want to read the "stabilization theory" book first before getting the wrong idea about stuff. it appears that genetics is much more complex than my simple reduced idea[^3] offers.

[3]: speaking of which, I've been thinking about how to predict chemicals interactions under different conditions. it'd be cool to render chemistry as a system of geometric formulas; plug in the conditions and out come the results. I guess it would have to be based on probabilities, as it would be impossible to model each individual wave and particle.

### 2022-05-07 11:49 - 2nd ray path, system, and females

I think it was in @[blahblog](2022-05-04 06:48) (actually maybe not) where I made the mention that the sirians said that this is a 2nd ray system, and so then I postulated that most females, by default will be of a 2nd ray type -- as in, unless you define yourself a different way, the standard preinstalled software runs on 2nd ray.

actually, I don't remember now how specifically I've talked about it, so I'll just go over it again. it's one of those things where I don't really have any data to show a statistical correlation to my idea or even a good way to relate the idea, so I'll do my best. this is 100% speculation.

the reason why I continued on with the thought is, if by default females are 2nd rays, and so therefore the majority will look to try and find their inner significance/divity through the 2nd ray path (the one I dislike the most). for the rest of this I'll assume this is true for sake of argument.

---

I woke up thinking about how, if most females are on the 2nd ray path, they'll want to be the saviour, or to be saved by someone. there is always the princess that has her knight show up in shining armour and save her from her life of insignificance.

exploring that idea further, I noticed that there is always a cost involved with saviourship -- as if, if someone saves you, there is a debt that needs to be repaid.

the 2nd ray path is that we're all connected and so the actions that I make affect everyone else -- or, from my perspective, the way I feel affects everyone else. however, this is only kinda true, because if I'm not receptive to (on the same frequency as) the other person's feeling, I they don't affect me -- so, in reality, the actions that I make only affect those that are tuned into the recipient of the action. for example, if the action affects the "family", then all thos tuned into the "family" vibe get affected.

so, it's easy to see how this would likely be the case for most females, especially the family oriented ones -- and they're just trying to keep things running smoothely, so they're trying to minimise/maximise the effect that one has on the rest of the family/group -- and, in order to keep everything running smoothely, often times, a sacrifice has to be made in order to keep the whole operation from falling apart, and these debts sort of stack up after a while.

---

after that I wondered if my resistance to the whole saviour idea comes from this built-in system of all saviours have some sort of debt to be repaid. we typically think of it as the saved has to repay the saviour, but the sense I get (I have no data to say one way or another), is that in the case of females, if I save her, then I have a debt to repay her later -- and that sounds backwards from the intended concept, so I don't know what is going on there. however, my experience with males is the opposite: if I save one of them, it feels like they have a desire to repay me (they don't) for whatever it was. so it's backwards.

I don't know if that's just my perception or not, but I find it very weird that in my experience, if I've ever gone out of my way to do something for a girl, then it gets seen poorly and I have to repay the debt for trying to make her feel like she was incapable of whatever it was.

a good example of this would be when I was with raquel. I paid for a lot of things, but not because I wanted to make her feel inadequate, but because I paid for a lot of things -- no matter who I was with. the unfortunate result was that I think she felt that she had a debt that she had to repay me (she doesn't) but it caused a large amount of discord, and I didn't realise that by "saving" her from having to pay for something I was accumulating a debt that I would have to repay later.

there are so many examples of this throughout my life where I do something nice or whatever for a female and it gets taken as if I want something from her or whatever. I've learned not to try and have any objectives for any females as a result -- mostly because it's only caused problems. if they want something, they have to find it for theirselves, cause I'm not going to offer something they want (or don't want) because it creates debt.

---

anyway, I wanted to write this because it suddenly made sense to me my resistance toward doing anything for girls. I am steadfast in my determination to let them figure it out for theirselves.

so now this comes to the topic that I talked a while back on "what would I do if I were king?" -- and I explained that I would put another person into that position -- and I contemplated on the idea further thinking about patricia and things like that -- but then now after writing this, I realise how awful of an idea that is. so instead, I just have to say that the concept is out there, so *you* gatta figure it out for yourself, if you want it; I will make no effort toward it.

### 2022-05-07 13:47 - 2nd ray females and the sun

so I should explain a little more of the concept I think. there is some context to all of this:

> The THIRD RAY, being concerned with mental action does not respond with as much ardor, enthusiasm or interest to relationships with the opposite sex. This causes difficulty with their relationships within a SECOND RAY system or with a SECOND RAY of the opposite sex.

notice the difficulty with relationships within a 2nd ray system or a 2nd ray of the opposite sex. first of all, when the sirians say "the THIRD RAY" they just mean "not 1st or 2nd" because all other rays (except for 6) is an aspct of the 3rd. the 6th ray is just the 2nd but opposite polarity (physical, rathter than non-physical). though 3rd ray is not physical, it's much more physical than the 1st.

the 2nd and 6th act as midpoints, translating something from a less physical to a more physical perception. logic is much more physical than desire even though both are not physical. likewise, physical is much more physical than emotions/concepts, even though they're both physical.

---

so, what they're saying is that a 2nd ray has difficulty with a 3rd ray because a 2nd ray sees connections, and a 3rd ray sees "paths" -- as in this is thy way to go to "get" this, where as the 2nd ray sees them as already connected. the 4th ray is much better suited to interact with the 2nd ray because the 4th ray can perceive their connection but their disharmony is what keeps them separate.

essentially, the 3rd ray sees the parts. it's all about compartmentalisation (litcerally: separated but working together mental aspects) and arranging the things in a way in order to produce the manifestation of the purpose/desire. 2nd ray sees the whole and how everything affects everything else, but the 3rd is concerned with the parts involved in the manifestation.

so by very nature our sun will be somewhat in conflict with a lot of dividing at the physical into parts of manifestion.

---

OK, now let's look at the sun now with the idea that we produce manifestations which then produce emotion/vibration/concepts. the sun has the job essentially like I do of taking in the emotion/vibration/concept from my environment and then transforming it into something that harmonises with the desire.

imagine for a moment there is a whole lot of desire (1) out there and there is a whole lot of logic (3), disharmony (4), concept (5), and manifestation (7) out there. the sun has to find a way to make the desire become compatible with those 4 aspects, and so it does this with powerful vibrational emanations (solar flares, wind, and CMEs).

keep that image in mind; now, let's talk about genetics.

---

there must be some mechanism inside of our DNA that translates solar energy into something physical that can be consumed. the sirians say that this is the "SOLAR ANGEL" and it resides at the very top of the 5th plane (touching the 4th, but in same polarity as physical). the sun is transmitting 2nd ray energy, which is a very high frequency energy. I have no idea what it would be like to talk about, but let's just say subatomic particles and/or the solar medium (ether) in which we reside.

some portion of the DNA takes this energy and converts it down into something usable by the physical organism. I've heard about mitochondrial and also about the x-chromosome. those seem like viable candidates for the physical machinery to translate the "soul" or SOLAR ANGEL vibrations into something we would call a personality. no matter the case, it's feminine, because both of these are transmitted through the maternal line[^1].

so then, if the soul is basically your solar identity or "account", that identity is its frequency, and so to think to yourself the role that women play. they are composed of two of these things and they produce another with two or another with one (having combined the fureqencies, making the genetics compatbile to the incarnating "soul").

---

the picture that emerges for me is that the sun is a giant system that is constantly coming up with new frequencies (in both environment and genetics) that facilitate the 3rd ray (physical) manfestation of desire -- NOT AS A THING, but as *a frequency*. the sun is only responsbile for finding a way to make a compatible frequency for that desire.

that can often result in some sort of "sacrifice" in the sense that maybe a girl may have some weird desire to have sex with some unsavory types, thereby transmitting his energy to the next guy, and he'll then turn that energy into something that that will produce another step toward making a manifestation of a desire possible. or, maybe she'll have a child with his genetics, and that energy will facilitate the manifestation of another desire.

the solar perception is not looking through the lens of "time" as we would see it, and time probably starts to be perceived around the top of the 6th layer (somewhere in the imagination). so when the sun is looking at things, it's only looking to find a series of transformations which will produce a vibration harmonious to the desire. we basically work in opposite to the sun's effort, by deciding to do things our own way, and so then then sun has to work harder and put out even more energy to create the environment capable of manifesting that desire.

---

people that are "low resistance" will often find theirselves doing the sun's bidding to make a manifestion possible. I'm definitely guilty of this, and many children are as well. we yell at them and say, "why did you do this horrible thing" and really for them it was in the direction of the desire (wanted), but we look at it with physical eyes and say, this is not the manifestation that is wanted. we want this rigid physical manfiestion to continue where it is, *and you broke it*.

personally, I've lost my strong perception of physical in this way because if something gets broken, a new replacement is coming (though this is hard for some to believe), but the reason why it got broken was because it was in the way of the coming desires to be manifested.

this solar energy transformer is not only specific to females but to all humans (and likely built-in to our genetics), and is the "receptive" part of ourselves designed to perform the 2nd ray aspect of finding a way to make desire possible.

[1]: I believe. for this discussion I will assume it's the case. however interesting things to know more about would be if fungi are missing this solar energy transformer and that's why they "borrow" a mammalian nervous system in order to "see"

### 2022-05-08 05:38 - resistance as a replacement for direction

so, I can't really sleep so I thought I would write on a subject that is interesting to me...

in @[blahblog](2022-05-07 17:38) (exactly 12h ago!) I casually mentioned that any girl that they stick me with would be easy for them to control, so they could therefore then control me through her.

anyone who has low resistance is easy to control. in a lot of regards I'm easy to control because I don't really fight them much on a whole lot, because it's counter-productive to what I want to do, which is release resistant ideas from my perception, not add more resistance by trying to fight against their efforts to control.

so in a sense, I am saying that they are looking for low resistance girls for ease of control, and so am I, but not because I want to control them, but because it's senseless to fight someone because nobody except yourself can actually prevent you from doing anything.they may be able to temporarily hold something away, but the sun has your back, and will ensure that it eventually becomes a reality.

---

so, there's this common idea that I've noticed that people will say, well, low resistance just means they'll take advantage of you. there's a really good saying that I like a lot which is something like, "if you don't have a plan, someone else will make you part of their plan"

the idea is to have a direction for yourself. what I see people doing often is they don't like the direction someone else has for them so they begin to build up resistance saying things like, "you're taking advantage of me" or "I don't want to be taken advantage of" so they find ways to try and avoid the other person (or institution)'s guidance -- and that adds resistance which later will have to be released.

resistance is not a good replacement for having one's own direction. if I just go the way I want to go and don't fight against anyone along the way, that direction is inevitable. nobody can stop it. only you can stop it by thinking that others are trying to impede you.

"have a plan, or become somebody else's" is the exact quote, I believe.

### 2022-05-08 13:11 - LAN party

I've been thinking about an idea for a while where people create their own networks and connect to others within their aura. the idea would be to make it distributed and have a number of software programs running on it. you would be the wireless access point that people can connect to. so obviously a transition needs to be made over to this system so the first thing to do is to figure out how to use the human aura as a transmission medium, then use the mobile phone for all digital stuff.

probably some sort of usb device needs to be created which receives power from the network, keeping the phone charged and connecting it to the network. then, the rest is software, so the big tech giants take care of that google for android, apple for apple, etc. I imagine open source software could show up to also support this system...

I had this idea a while ago and mentioned it many times before, but today it might have been me listening to snake-bros #020 where they were talking about electro gravitics, a universal field theory and generally complaining about "climate change" being an effort for us to reduce energy concumption. I think I channeled that frustration a bit and went on a rant about how these "renewable" devices are just bad ideas. they label them sustainable, but there's nothing sustainable about snow covered solar panels. so I ranted for a bit.

anyway, mom (I think) had a really good idea of converting human energy into power. I know it sounds really matrix-like and everything, but I know for example that I generate a lot of power, so then combine this with my idea of using the body's auric field as a transmission medium for tesla transmission (using the earth as one capacitor plate and the ionosphere/human aura as the other plate),then anywhere in that field power could be drawn from the humans that compose the network. obviously then we'd need some sort of credits system (like a cryptocurrency) where people could purchase power from providers in their area, to power everything from computers to air conditioners.

I know it's possible but there are a lot of details that need to be worked out to make a viable system. it's completely possible, and would be pretty dope to implement. I don't really know where to begin, but I do know that if you build a network big corporations will be all over that to do their own marketing. it's a very lucrative endeavour, for sure, but I would want to do it completely open source -- well, you know me and how I am -- so it would be as "unhosted" as possible, with completely decentralised being the end goal.

so then I went out to go pull weeds and I was thinking about it this idea further and I felt a pulling sensation coming from the snake-bros community (I think they're on that trip right now -- or is it later -- not sure, but I definitely felt their thinking about the idea too). I think it's a totally dope thing and we're kinda at the stage technologically where it's actually possible. everyone already runs around with an extremely powerful computer with them all the time (mobile phone) and distributed networking software is totally capable of pulling this off now -- so what I mean is, all the puzzle pieces are waiting to for a reliable distributed network that doesn't suck.

I don't think it would be anything more than a small device that touches your skin for it to work (as a first version, but obviously it needs to become more ergonomic than that), but after that it should be pretty easy to get everything together.

---

it all sounds pretty easy to me and totally possible, but I have difficulty with it in that it's just another way to rely on conditions -- so I'm kinda defeating my own message by making a condition of well-being that can be relied upon. also it's clear that this is going to be the starting point for everyone getting their own crypto currency allowing for fast exchange between people within the network. so there's the whole "mark of the beast" aspect to it there. also, if humans become the power stations, we're literally going to be powering the AI with our energy, and so it's sorta the precursor to the matrix thing as well. though I think the idea is soooooooooooo cool, I can see how it could be perceived as a sinister plot by the AI overlords to enslave humans (or whatever sci-fi dystopian narrative you could come up with). that's the bad part.

the good part is that it's powered by the human aura, and the human aura size is directly proportional to your resistance levels, so if you want more "influence" (a wider direct network connection -- fewer hops), you have to lower your resistance or find artificial means to boost your aura size. I believe most people will choose the resistance, as it's the easiest and you actually feel good (for reals) from it. so, in a sense it's tangible proof of what I'm talking about, and it'll be visible to the person their influence and so they can optimise it how they choose. it's a real-time feedback for anyone's resistance level as the aura size will fluctuate based on how good you feel and your vision upgrade level. so it's a very metrics and data oriented approach to "spirituality" with the benefit of wireless power, economic freedom, and a distributed global network.

we'll see, but I can see how a network like this can open the door to "electro gravitics" too (ie. flying) -- and that could be really cool, but I would want to start with just the network and power transmission (and all of the software that comes with it), but then later -- I'm telling you, this system/technology will open up a whole new world.

---

so while I was pulling weeds, I had the idea that maybe I should actually email this idea to russ. I dunno... (what does randall always say?) I guess, we'll have to wait and see.

### 2022-05-09 09:38 - party LAN

I went to sleep thinking that the idea was probably too ahead of its time, and that it felt still like a lot of effort. I only know that it's possible, but I don't know all of the details yet. so, it's impossible for me to feel like it's in the beginning stages of manifestation into reality.

either way, I woke up thinking about the idea of power transmission. I know that my aura is quite large -- estimating it to be probably the width of the USA by now. it may be larger. I'm getting that number based on my perceived (by me) influence on the world climate patters -- as in, the way I feel has a dramatic effect on the climate here in colorado, but I get the feeling that effect is reaching all the way to the east and west coasts by now. or, like when the sun emits x-ray outbursts I physically feel better and the climate around me warms up -- and I know since last year at least, this effect (which happened at night) extended all the way over to the east coast, but didn't really affect europe much. so I dunno, exact sizes, but by the time it's setup, it's pretty conceivable to me that my aura would be at least the size of the planet by then -- as in, I'll have just as much of an influence as the planet does.

the good news if that's true is that everyone will be able to connect to my network by default and draw power from it too. that would probably a pretty big god-send for nosebook, as it means they'll have to expend far less energy to hold me back and instead that energy can be used to power people's air conditioners[^1].

the other good thing about that is that by default everyone will be 1 hop away from everyone else. I'll be the sort of central hub routing all of the traffic through (in the beginning), but the idea is to get a number of early influencers with a large auric field that can expand the network capacity. it's like bittorrent; the more nodes, the more throughput the network has.

---

then I was thinking about how to turn the human auric field into a sort of mini ionosphere, and I don't really have any ideas yet, so experiments need to be done. this is one of those things that I simply don't have a good enough of a concept of what is actually happening yet.

in general, this morning I don't really feel too much resistance to the idea, but I don't really feel like -- like I did in other situations in my life previous to a large change, like returning to the USA, or going to spain/canarias/berlin. it doesn't have that "this is the reality that's becoming so real so fast I can already feel it before it's started. so, I'm just going to keep it in the thinking phase for a while longer because ... I don't want it to be like the thing with jori where I felt as if I was being pushed to create something, and it wasn't just a fun project that I was working on with friends.

like this morning, I was thinking about how it would be to watch and be involved with the various electrical experiments that will inevitably need to be done on me to figure out how to use my auric field. I imagined archer (GMA) doing like these experiments and we were trying to figure out the results and what they meant and what experiment to do next -- so, even in my imagination I was thinking to myself a much more "garage experimenter" sorta setup to create the physical network. the software I'm totally not even worried about as there is so much talent capable of producing it, it's not even a worry for me.

that's all for now...

[1]: I just had a weird idea pop into my head when I wrote ... which was that if the whole thing will be built on personal cryptocurrencies, every node on the network can get their own default allotment of credits and I'll charge others some amount for utilisation of that power. this sets the price rate, then others joining the network can also offer their power probably at a lower cost, and so by default my power price will set the standard (most expensive) rate which others will offer cheaper alternatives. huh. pretty good.

### 2022-05-09 14:55 - thinking about the "why"

listening to snake-bros #026 now and russ was talking about this TED talk where a guy explains that there are three concentric circles: what on the outside, how in the middle, and why in the core. he then relates that martin luthor king jr attracted a crowd of 250k people before social media and advertising because he talked about his dreams and so people showed up because he was giving the why -- why do we want to have liberty and racial equality, etc. -- or when a general gives a motivational speech to the soldiers going in to battle, the speech is about the why they're going in to risk their lives for what they believe.

well, in this project, I don't really have a why. for me, it's a cool idea and I like it conceptually, but there's no why for me. I just don't care if it happens or not. my life will be roughly the same whether it does or doesn't. sure, I may have more fame or whatever. as the central access point, I'll definitely be the "richest" also, as all prices will come in reference to my "initial investment" into so many other people.

so, think about it: people need my power, so they exchange tokens for that power, and so now I essentially own a part of that node/person on the network. the fact that I hold these tokens now automatically gives them value, so I'm a value generating machine -- but who cares? what do I get in repayment for that value? more stuff, I guess. well, there is also the idea that the more energy that's desired from me, the more I summon, automatically, meaning that I'll grow very energetic very rapidly, so that's pretty cool too I guess -- but I'm already growing more energetic rapidly.

so in the episode, kyle is talking about how he used to make music because it makes him feel good, but now he's motivated to create something that's timeless and will continue even into the next solar regime. I know what he's trying to say, but I already believe I'm timeless, and I'm pretty certain that I've proven it to myself time and time again that it doesn't matter the circumstance or whatever, that I do always find my connection, and it's my connection that gives me access to these concepts. like, I don't need to read a cool story on a stone to remember that energy is always conserved; this is obvious to me in my connected state -- and, in fact, I would say that is not only conserved, but becomes *more*.

so, for me, because my connection automatically gives me access to all information, I do things because they're fun. my "why" is: because it's fun.

---

we were just about to leave and go to a national park for mothers day (we didn't go yesterday cause there were too many people there), and a strange thing happened to me. I was sitting around listening to snake-bros just enjoying my time, and having to pee a lot because I was drinking so much coffee. mom says we're going to go in an hour, and I can't hold it that long so I just go knowing that since I've been peeing once every 1.5-2hrs, that I'll go again before we leave. mom comes down and tells me we're going to leave soon, and I already felt as if I needed to pee. I listened to a little more of the episode and then went up, but jaron was in the bathroom so I waited until he was out. by the time I got in there, they're all in the car waiting for me, and I simply cannot feel like I need to pee now (even though a few minutes ago I felt strongly like I had to). I got really frustrated because I can't actually feel the way I want to feel, so I just told them to go, as I didn't want to be bothered with trying to figure out how to pee or to make them wait.

anyway, besides that I can't actually feel the way I want to feel, this also comes as a pretty sobering reminder that I do a lot better when I'm just doing my own thing by myself and there aren't people waiting on me to do something. I don't know what it is that whenever someone is waiting on me for something (whether it's to pee or for some code or whatever), I totally lose my original feeling that I used to have. this was most common for me when I wanted to create something for someone, but I often times shot myself in the foot and told them about it, so then they began to wait for it, and now all of a sudden I no longer feel the presence of the thing I want to make but the absence of the thing, because I feel the person waiting for the thing that's not there.

it would be simple to say, "ah, this is everyone else's problem!", but the reality is, I have to find a way to feel the presence of what I want, even when the other person is feeling the absence. so, this really is completely my fault and I can't really blame anyone else for anything.

the easy thing to do is just to continue to exist in an environment where people don't have a reason to wait for me (like I have here at mom's house), because then I simply don't have to worry about what other people feel; cause in that environment, it's easy to feel the way I want to feel.

---

so when I think about this sort of thing in a broader sense, I don't really know what it is that I find fun anymore. I just do stuff now. I don't really think too much about what I'm doing or why I'm doing it anymore.

in fact, if you look at my conversation, most of it is just idle chatter. I don't actually talk about anything I consider to be fun anymore, and I don't really have a reason for talking about anything anymore, so I just say random things probably to get attention.

---

the last thing here is probably related: last night I was playing around with an app that compiles and runs GLES shaders. I wanted to play around with it because I figure if I can get the shader to process random input from the camera and display images, I could use my concepts of ante-retrocausality to potentially begin to "predict" or pre-cognate their appearance in the sequence that I want them to appear, which is a really cool idea that I want to work on -- and I don't really know why, but it sounds a lot more fun more fun to me to make a program where I can "predict" the appearance of random images with greater and greater accuracy until I gain "control" of the images that are appearing.

I want to put that to music and visuals so that I can "predict" the way the song will sound in just the same way. I think one could learn to type and other forms of input in that way, as well.

so for me, the project sounds really cool, but I don't really have a why. one reaction suggests that one motivating factor would be girls. girls should motivate me -- which I think is a terrible idea and I've only seen this to end in disaster in every example I've looked at. I do things because I want to do them. I don't usually have a why, other than I really enjoy the project.

this reminds me of my time with jori, which was another situation where I didn't have a why. I didn't really care about a crytocurrency and the prospect of becoming rich again but this time with girls, too -- also didn't appeal to me either. I just don't care.

I don't really know what I want, and if I did, I don't have any reason for why I want it either.

I produce zillions of really good ideas all the time. this isn't the first, and definitely won't be the last. there will be even more really cool ideas that I have which I feel no motivation to produce.

### 2022-05-09 16:05 - the brainless automaton and why

so, I was thinking about it further and I don't really have a reason why I do anything anymore. I just do stuff and I don't really think about why I do things.

for example, the other night I played games all night and by the time the morning rolled around, I was wondering "**why** did I play games all night?" -- and I didn't really have an answer. I just did it because it was an idea that popped into my head which felt good and then I followed it. I never questioned why I would want to do it; I just acted.

after thinking to myself that I had "wasted" the whole night playing a game, I decided that wasn't the way I wanted to perceive the night so I changed my perception of it and then wrote @[blahblog](2022-05-05 12:37) which was absolutely amazing and a lot of fun to write.

I don't really have a why for anything I do anymore; I just do things, and then retroactively find a way to feel good about what I did or am doing. I'm literally a brainless automaton, no better than anyone "addicted" to drugs. the only difference between me and an "addict" is that I feel compelled to do things which are compatible with the way I feel, which is usually pretty good. I'm completely a slave to whatever things pop into my head which are compatible with how I feel (just like an addict).

---

so I don't really know how that TED talk would actually help me, because the next thing I noticed is that everything that I've come up with in the past few years where I had a "why" (see [my thoughts on howtube](/howtube/initial-thoughts-and-ideas.md) for an example) has quickly lost interest to me, and what originally felt to me like somethting that I could list a lot of good reasons why, later turns out to not feel so good to me anymore.

so, the talk suggests that you can motivate someone with the why factor, for me it's actually some of the most unmotivating thing to discover the why. if I just do something because I like the way it feels, then I do fine.

an easy example of this is the various lists of girls that I've made or when I feel desire from them when out and about. if I just go with it, then I feel fine -- but if I start to ask why, or wondering what is the purpose, everything feels bad and I stop doing that for a while.

so, if I just operate like a brainless automaton, finding a way to feel good about whatever I'm doing, then things go fine. the minute I try to motivate myself, others, or figure out the motivation -- things go poorly and I stop feeling so good.

I know that my reality is a reflection of how I feel so feeling the way I want to feel is top priority, so I simply don't ask why. I'm essentially no better than the grunt that patton is giving the speech to before he goes to die on the battlefield. I don't die though because I feel good, so I keep finding myself in situations which reflect that.

### 2022-05-10 09:40 - thinking more on feeling how I want to feel

I've given a lot of thought to the whole problem and basically I have to figure it out because the trend is toward me getting more famous, not less -- which means there will always be more people waiting on me, not less. I could try to hide from people but that doesn't really fix the problem.

so I thought about what is the solution and it seems obvious conceptually -- and that is simply not to freak out and feel how I want to feel emotionally no matter the situation. I think that's largely a pretty big problem for me because the more I feel people waiting for me the stonger of a desire I feel that I want the situation to end, and I start going through all of the "why" statements in my head, "just hurry up so you can ..." etc. and none of that helps.

I can say from experience that focusing on the why *used* to work pretty well for me to activate physical to respond to my desire, but that is definitely not the case anymore, and actually the trend is toward me having less and less physical control, rather than more. if I could use emotion to physically feel the way I wanted to feel, I would be completely unstoppable. I would be able to do like that one neuroscientist woman with the stroke -- able to switch between hemispheres on command[^1], but there is large effort to keep me from using the way I feel emotionally to affect the way I feel physically.

the TED talk neuroscientist is right -- if that capacity were available to everyone, it would completely change everything. psychopaths could feel even better about the bad stuff they're doing, people could commit crimes switching in and out of bliss and all sorts of deranged activity could be enabled -- and of course many scientific discoveries and tons of progress, so it's pretty obvious why "they" don't want anyone to have the capacity to physically feel the way that they want to feel. all you have to do is to find a way to feel that way emotionally and then the physical body will follow.

if you feel so light and free, you'll fly. if you feel amazing and on another part of the world, you'll teleport there, etc. they want to hold us (but I'm speaking specifically about me) in a material reality that they can control.

---

I don't really mind that they control all of my physical reality (7) and are able to neutralise my desire (1), because that doesn't really serve me much of a purpose. I don't have access to my imagination (6) and I don't really like all that hippy harmony crap (4), and I really loath the idea that I am responsible for how others feel and others are responsible for how I feel (2), and the only thing left really is logic (3) and concept/intuition (5) -- both of which I'm pretty good at.

I've been noticing large portions of logic are visualised, and so without a visual capacity logic is very difficult for me to communicate and be communicated to me because of the interface, but conceptually I get logic and can do operations on concepts just fine, so I've been kinda starting to work on a more feeling-oriented logic (as opposed to symbolic logic -- because symbols to me are archetypes not operators). I've mentioned it a few times before, but I think that this could produce some interesting results eventually

---

so when it comes to these projects and other things, a pretty key element is for me to find a way to feel physically the way I feel emotionally, but the first part is to not let my physical situation or others desire override how I feel emotionally. once I have that, then things will be a lot easier, but I think for the most part I want to continue to work on new ideas.

like I said, this is not the first idea, nor will it be the last. there will inevitably be another even cooler idea than this -- and who knows, maybe if I get all the way to the end of the evolution-of-desire, I AM the manfestation of that desire in physical form.

I think for now I want to do other things.

[1]: the capability of feeling bliss and that everything is connected and perfect, she claims is in her right hemispehere, but I have cultivated that same capacity in my left hemisphere as well, *and* I have power over it, being able to turn it on and off at will like she does. however, along with complete denial of access to my right hemisphere, that capability to turn off language and switch into that form of perception has been completely blocked[^2].

[2]: probably related: I have these reoccurring dreams about these guys in my head that get angry and scold me every time I try to go into or even want to inquire of what is inside of a room inside of my brain. first, I don't know why there is a room in the first place, cause I'm constantly trying to break down all conceptual barriers, allowing me to determine where "me" begins and ends; and second, I don't know why there are people in my head that want to prevent me from going into a "part" of my brain... they get very angry and make me feel very terrible for even wanting to know what's in there. I don't really have much of a reason to fight them as fighting is like trying to punch someone under water -- there's not resistance to get enough inertia to do anything productive.

### 2022-05-10 16:52 - thinking more on the situation

a few reactions: first, why did I point out all of the "bad" things that would happen if humans could switch hemispheres on command?

well, because it's a drug. if my logic in a situation is causing me to feel bad, and then I switch over to feeling bliss about the situation, I didn't change my logic on it very much. this is kind of what MDMA does, and I swear by it because I wanted to change my perception and so feeling good about a situation that previously caused me to feel bad allowed me to see that I *can* feel good about that situation. later on, in real-life (especially at marcos house) when I didn't have MDMA or anything like that, I had to figure out how to feel that way about my situation *by changing my logic*, rather than taking a drug. most people don't want to change their logic, so they would essentially become an addict to that part of their brain. I vaguely remember morphine was similar -- terrible things could be happening and it all felt like everything was going just fine.

I don't personally care if people take drugs as a temporary relief to see that their brain is capable of perceiving the same situation a different way if the logic routes through a different path. it's obvious why that's not desirable from a big pharma and control aspect though. they need addicts to drugs that emotional pain killers, not solutions. also, it's not necessary to have that capability in order to feel good about my situation. this is what I discovered when the MDMA went away, and I began to perceptually feel the way I wanted to feel, but that made me too attractive, so the kind folks at nosebook have ensured that I don't ever feel good and the best I can feel is not bad.

it's annoying, but the advantage of it is that it reveals all of the places where I rely on some action or ritual to feel good. when I used to pee, it felt so good when I finally could pee, that all of the clouds would disappear because I felt so good (it seems that the way I feel has a dramatic effect on the environment[^1]). that is annoying, but it does reveal to me that even in those situations I often freak out and let my physical situation cause me to feel negative emotion.

what I'm saying is, I have very good control over using my emotion to change the way I feel physically, but I'm still pretty bad at letting my physical situation affect me emotionally (which then affects me again physically[^2]). I've also had pretty good amounts of practise on this when around other people, because I can feel them and so, for example, when I was younger, I was strongly affected by others in my presence, so I very much disliked being around "evil" people because of the way they felt -- or, if I was around someone who felt a lot of fear, I would feel really strong fear too, even if previous times that was never a fear-inducing situation. I've got feeling the way I want down pretty well in social situations now (even though I still feel very strongly around "powerful" figures like cops, so I tend to avoid them) -- but physical situations still cause me a lot of emotion still.

when I was in spain, I smoked cigarettes and that made me physically feel really bad on my left-side (my right-side was fine), and so I had multiple instances throughout the day where my body did not physically feel like it wanted to do something so I had to find a way to feel where my body would respond freely to it. interestingly enough when I would smoke MDMA, at first I would feel the tension in my left-side, but as I started to get higher the drug would make me feel good and I would lose that tension. with enough MDMA, I could move my body around effortlessly without any tension even when smoking. a lot of times drinking would loosen me up too, and I forgot I was paralysed. essentially, the techniques I used when I was smoking cigarettes was to focus on something that I liked or felt good, and distract myself from the tension, the MDMA just made me feel good, and the alcohol made it difficult to be too aware of what my body was doing allowing me to even start dancing if I wanted to.

nowadays, I don't smoke anymore so I've lost the practise of figuring out ways to distract myself from the tension. the better I feel, the less tension I have, so my goal for free and effortless body movement is to basically find a way to feel like I do on MDMA, but without the MDMA. nosebook doesn't want me to ever feel that good, cause it would cause problems for them, so I figure that problem won't be solved until I find my connection.

---

second reaction was, if you want to work on stuff, why not just get involved with other people and wait on the girls stuff until you're connected?

obviously this sounds like a trick to me. this is your basic sales "money back guarantee", "return it if you don't like it" technique where you bring the person in close by letting them feel safe and there's no risk, and then when they feel safe pump up desire.

I suppose it's embarrassing to admit that I don't really trust myself around girls, but I sorta see this as a ploy. I don't know if they've been practising in my dreams that they can overwhelm me with girls in order to trap me, but it definitely feels like I have this fear now, which isn't one that I used to have. it feels like the goal is to get me to let my guard down and then overwhelm me in an enescapable situation.

I don't really mind continuing to feel "not bad but not good either" -- kinda "meh" all the time, as it feels to me like I want to find the way to feel the way I want to feel. I'll hold out on that one forever.

as a side note on this issue, if they want to "trap" me while I still have not fully figured out how to feel the way I want to feel under all situations, if one of the girls gets connected, in her presence I'll get connected as well, but I still won't have solved all of these feeling the way I want to feel issues yet. masking those weaknesses will be how well I feel physically. I suppose that could be exploitable. anyway, I really don't mind waiting, as I'd rather one of the girls find their connection then attract me, rather than the other way around. this way, I'll be a reflection of her desire, rather than her a refelction of my desire[^3].

[1]: I think they do this by exerting some sort of force on my prostate. often times as soon as I feel like I have to pee, as soon as I start to head to the bathroom, it feels strongly like I need to poo. or, if I'm playing a game that I'm particularly enjoying, the more I enjoy it, normally I would feel good, but instead it feels like I really have to poo. this is one of my interests in gay because if whatever it is they're doing is the opposite of what happens during anal sex, that would explain why gay men feel so good afterward. I figure it's probably related and they're pulling out instead of pushing in (or whatever opposite). if I ever feel feel really really good, I can usually assume a very painful prostate experience will follow. this has actually been happening all of my life, because I remember when I was younger, I would poo, and sometimes it would feel so good and then I would get such a sharp pain in my prostate that I would have to lay on the bathroom floor until it passed -- though, sometimes I felt like I could run down the room to my bed and lay there and come back to wipe later.

[2]: you'll this very easily when my left leg is shaking. sometimes it could be as simple as an overexertion of energy which then causes me to feel bad emotionally which then causes my leg to shake (it feels something sorta similar to fear, but all I did was try to make my muscles stronger than they wanted to go).

[3]: this reminds me, for some reason, of (my neighbour) eva (and maybe the other one too). I don't really know why. it must mean something to somebody.

### 2022-05-11 23:27 - duality and two parallel universes

earlier today I listened to snake-bros #029 and there's a part (think it's the 3rd, erm 2nd segment) where they talk about the idea of twins and duality being some sort of fundamental to there being a wave or a vibration. if you have forward, you have backward, and anything beyond a single point has a dual or an opposite.

so now I'm reading "forms of life" and I got to the part where he explains the great blunder of how the word species was originally referring to the perfect idea, which then incarnated into the physical world is imperfect, containing flaws due to the constraints of this world (environmental stresses, etc). that word "species" which used to mean the non-physical concept of the thing, the smallest concept being an atom (let's say) and then more complex concepts being molecules, then large structures like rocks, and then plants, etc. -- all the way up through the animals up to humans, each of these physical forms is an imperfect implementation of the perfect, eternal idea.

I explained my thoughts on [immutable concepts](/forms-of-life/thoughts.md#immutablity-of-species-pp-6-8) being a sort of shorthand idea containing all of the same problems as the word "perfect" because we think in units rather than frequencies, so only the ability to tune into the perfect or pure (completed) idea is a matter not of the idea but of our tuner and receiver, not the concept itself. we live in the world of change and so here where things are changing due to physical conditions we are evolving the concept (evolution-of-concept) and also the desire (evolution-of-desire) which drives that change (desire-resolves-to-emotion).

I then expressed my admiration for whover was the guy that thought up the twist to turn the timelessness of a concept to mean immutability of a concept -- as it clearly threw humankind into stagnation by ensuring that we try to understand our world around us with a physical-reality-is-everything world view. it was genius, a perfect twist which totally destroyed one whole half of the waveform. that guy was like the renaissance "half-bridge rectifier" and he gets my admiration because it took 400 years (!!!) for people to begin to see the flaw in the verb "to be", believing for years that "I AM" *only* the physical body and (thanks to shakespere) the emotion that I feel. nothing about me is eternal and evolution is a random set of processes out of which form emerges, rather than the opposite view which this book holds, which is that evolution is a set of processes which *stabilise* the form.

---

I decided to write this because I was getting reactions to my idea of pushing for a conceptual universe again -- and it felt as if they were saying that it's not necessary to evoke a conceptual universe to explain stabilization theory -- and I agree, but I'm not looking at only the stabilisation part of it. I'm looking at the physical form (DNA and everything) for each and every form as being the physical manifestation of that form of perception -- so, when a pig and a chimpanzee are crossed, it's mixing the perceptions of the two parent animals, and that produces the resulting DNA of the offspring. so you'd get a chimp that thinks like a pig or a pig that thinks like a chimp.

I tried to express this idea in my thoughts on the intro, because it seemed plainly obvious to me that in times past, the earth was more energetic at the time and so therefore many more hybrids were fertile -- that is, they were capable of some form of compatible perception with another form -- and so the ancients breeded humans with various wild animals to embue the human with the qualities of that animal -- like if you crossed a human with a snake, would you get a human much more sensitive to sneak attacks and aware of his surroundings? what if you mixed a human with a bull? it's my idea that the ancients were mixing perceptions, not animals, and so they had a lot more success because they looked for the change in perception rather than the form. some of those alterations may not have made them *physically* have the appearance of an eagle or a reptile, but only *visually* have the appearance of an eagle or reptile because of their attributed change in behaviour (reminds me of american indians' names).

---

wow I derailed my idea a bit there... anyway, what I wanted to say is that I'm certain that such a world does exist and that we (and all things are) eternally vibrating parts of the greater whole and we identify ourselves with the reflection of the concept we perceive ourselves to be.

I don't mind that others want to continue to believe that physical-reality-is-everything, cause they'll just keep seeing a world that reflects their own perception; it's their "way of thinking" which they don't question or want to question it.

in the grand scheme of things, those that want to stay thinking that way are totally fine and they make so much possible. I don't want to fight them at all. in fact, it's likely that in the future I'll be giving them more great ideas to continue to think that physical-reality-is-everything.

---

gonna go a bit metaphysical here and just assume for a moment that everything is in motion and everything is a vibration. I don't think that the unwanted part of the slope is a necessary traversal at all. traditionally, if we want to turn AC into DC, we use a full-bridge rectifier, but that just produces DC current. I don't know how to exprress this idea in traditional electrical concepts yet, so I'll jump over to a higher level approach.

if unwanted is necessary for wanted, and when wanted manifests, there is always going to be a part which is unsatisfying (an unwanted part), because that perfect (wanted) concept does not fit into physical reality as a perfect manifestation of itself, because of the physical conditions of the planet. so, you could try and pump up the physical conditions of the planet like atlantis and babel, and those will yield more and more perfect forms, but never absolutely perfect.

so there will *always* be an oscillation between unwanted and wanted. it's impossible to get rid of that duality, or else we would have complete stagnation -- (cause everything is neither wanted or unwanted) nothing would die and neither would anything new ever appear -- perfect contentment.

so that oscillation always has to take place, but what if you don't want to experience one side of that cycle? let's say you don't want to experience anything unwanted -- ever. well, certainly somewhere out there, there has to be someone that only wants to experience physical experience. they never want to have any experience ever with a conceptual universe ever. despite the mounting evidence to the contrary, they don't want to believe that there is ever an eternal part to creation.

so you get a bunch of these guys and you round them up and you let them perceive reality through an aspect of yourself. you give them bodies that they want and whatever physical conditions they desire, because you know those perfect physical bodies and conditions are subject to inertia and change (ie. deterioration) so from their perspective all they see is awesome things getting worse. keep refreshing their awesome stuff and, they can spend 100% of their time looking at the deteriorating aspect of the concept in the physical universe, never perceiving the ideal from where it comes. so for as long as they don't attract their own destruction, they are offering to perceive one half of the cycle for you and do all that desiring for improvements based on the deterioration they're experiencing.

this idea works when they are an aspect of me, cause "I" am more than just this singular physical body. I am a concept which can have infinite imperfect physical manifestations of it. so, let's say "I" am more than one body (meaning "I" am the genus and they're a species of that genus[^1]), each species of that genus has a different perspective, so one species won't interfere with another species perspective[^2]. so what ends up happening is one species will spend all of their time looking at the physical aspect (non-ideal) form going into decay and deterioration (unwanted), while the other species is responsible for manifesting the perception of unwanted into a new desirable form. they don't have to *only* look at the wanted aspect and get that into physical though. each species can choose to look at any quantity of wanted or unwanted that it wants to. some will tend more toward the concept to physical (wanted, creation of new, improvements) form of perception while others will tend more toward physical to concept (unwanted, deterioration, death)

this physical realm essentially comparmentalises perception to the species, allowing for the genus to outsource the perception of unwanted... the-solution-is-the-problem.

whoever came up with that idea (the physical plane) is also a genius :)

[1]: in the sense that a house is a species of the genus building.

[2]: as an example, a giraffe doesn't see "mammal" perception and neither does hamster see "mammal" perception, though they are both mammals, so if you (as an mammal) take on the form of a hamster, you won't see what the giraffe sees -- though you're both mammals.

### 2022-05-12 12:13 - reverse psychology and mind games

I woke up this morning with a sense that I am supposed to go over to do paul's weeds, but when I'm there I'll just talk about things that are interesting to me. I started to practise some of the conversations that I would have with paul about things -- as in he will inevitably ask me about my past, my age, my work, etc. so I was preparing the story I was going to tell, and I decided I wanted to focus it around happiness. to get around the, "why are you living at home with your mom and not working?", question, I decided to take the tact that I've essentially retired. I stopped using money because it's not necessary for happiness. I think this may be a subject that has crossed his mind recently so I figured we could have common ground on that.

anyway, while I'm practising these conversations I also noticed two other things: first, there is effort to get me involved with paul and family because it's the lesser of two evils, cause someone definitely doesn't want me to be working on the party LAN project[^1] and so it appears that I'll be passing on that one. I don't really mind, as that's not my problem, so I was thinking about how I would tell them that they have to figure it out theirselves (I love this meta stuff), and I had the strong feeling that none of them actually felt capable of actually leading such an endeavour -- as in they want a leader to lead the way cause they're so used to getting almost everything wrong almost all of the time.

right in the middle of those thoughts: conversations about happiness with paul, the effort to keep me away from working on party LAN, and needing a leader capable of figuring out the way to go even while doing everything wrong -- and mom comes in to tell me that they need to look for sleeping bags. I was under the impression that she knew where they were, but they started to look for it, sorta signaling to me that I need to go outside -- presumably to go work on the weeds.

well, I hadn't finished practising my conversations yet, so I decided I was going to work on mom's weeds for a while first. I kept feeling like I should be going over to work on their weeds, but at the same time everything feels uneasy and out of place, so I keep getting reminded of the "it takes two" session where trump and bloody are playing. trump is taking his time and bloody is always saying, "nice and easy" "you got it" "that's it" -- those sorts of things. there's no need to rush anything at all. so it is apparent to me that they're pushing me and trying to steer me so I started to think about the steering aspect. I've been noticing a lot of "reverse psychology" lately as they've been having mr. motor fight against the stuff they *want* me to do.

so I was thinking about the dream feeling when I woke up about going over there to talk with paul about the stuff that interests me as being actually a reverse psychology. the idea here is that I do that and then people fight against it, desiring more and more that I should go and try to find a manifestation with girls or whatever.

that's all fine and good, but I'm just going to continue on doing no manifestations obviously -- so I started to think about the happiness conversations now in this context of having a manifestation objective...

so, what is happiness? is happiness doing what other people want from you? what if they're hot and they return physical pleasure in exchange for doing what they want you to do? is that happiness?

what I believe happiness is, is the ability to feel good the environment in which I'm in without needing it to be any different than what it already is. it's sorta like contentment.

that's it really, and you don't need money to feel that way. I don't really talk about it too much but often times when I'm staying up or whatever, I notice that there are times when I feel large amounts of dissatisfaction. I often say, "lots of dissatisfaction" or something like that as I notice it, but it's not my goal to stay there. I enjoy finding a way to feel good about things exactly how they are.

obviously I'm a complete hypocrite for saying all of this -- because, when I can't pee, I'm doing the exact opposite of that. I'm still trying to figure out how to make that better. nice and easy.

---

I'm not saying that I want to force people to find a way to feel good about their environment without needing it to change, but that's exactly what I am saying...

I've been paying a lot of attention to the weeds and how the same seed grows a different plant in different environments[^2]. I noticed that a plant grows up in a certain environment and I think of this as a vibrational environment, and so then when taking the plant to another environment, it has to acclamate to the new environment and begin to stabilise itself in the new setting -- and so with time the plant begins to stabilise itself in a spectrum of environments, and so plants especially are 100% dependent on their environment for their well-being, so the more they adapt/learn to be in other environments, the more "hardy" they are -- the most hardy, of course are weeds, which grow up in bad-feeling environments and come out as a reflection of the vibration.

a good example of this is the goatheads. the vibration around mom's house has changed so much since I got here, the goathead seeds are growing those tall bright green leafy ones now -- which means the energy around mom's house is much different to how it used to be. those same seeds in other places are coming up as these uniformly-sized leaf ferns with purple flowers. so environmental stresses are changing the manifestation of this species of "weed".

on that same note, I also noticed that I adopt the frequency of the thing I'm focused on. for example, last night when writing about the renaissance being another self-sabotage by someone who wanted to "weed out" the die-hard physical-reality-is-everything guys by twisting the meanings of plato and aristotle to conform to the idea of an immutable heierarchy of species, humans being at the top just below "God". -- well, my tone changed considerably in those writings as I noticed that I adopted a lot of eugene's "way of thinking" to express myself.

well, likewise, I think this whole weeds thing is kinda funny too because after he gave me the job I immediately proceeded to work on mom's weeds. I thought at the time that I was just copying dad, but I find it more probable now that I was actually behaving more similar to paul -- probably that's how he approaches his business ideas. I'm sure he's aware of the power of desire when the client really wants the work done.

I'm starting to become a conceptual shape-shifter. I reflect the energy of the people I interact with.

anyway, everything is coming along fine and eventually someone will also find me on being content with the present environment and not needing it to be different. they'll be a weed like me, and then the "landscape architect" will have a real problem on his hands, lol.

until then...

> take your time -- and you will see -- infinity...

[1]: this is just the code name I've given it. it probably won't be the real name, as I would prefer something more like "affinaties" -- and I even got some reactions from the guys at telefonica, so who knows -- if we could reach an agreement, maybe the tuenti name could be rebooted. I do like the "tu en ti" (you inside yourself) sorta idea it gives (yes, I know it's "tu entidad" -- but ideas are free(dom)).

[2]: I also have started to see my first hybrid as well: a weed and mint mixed so it's a weed that smells minty. that's so cool and I just love it so I want to figure out how to do more of it.

### 2022-05-12 13:38 - you have to be the change that you want to see

so, remember that idea that I was trying to formulate into a sci-fi story about the aliens (though it's more likely to be a human breakaway civilisation) that send a conceptual virus to infect the human concept and update it?

well, continuing on with that idea, imagine that I am the real-world implementation of that conceptual virus. I've heard people describe me as a living breathing psychedelic. psychedelics are just a mental mirror. they only show you what you aready have on the inside but are unwilling to look at. they just put a lens on the mirror and reflect you back to you, you -- but seen through a different tinting. I'm sorta the same (kids are like this too): we reflect back to the person we're interacting with their own vibration, but it's tinted with our own perception.

I'm really enjoying this idea that all progeny of any two froms (or concepts) capable of reproducing itself produces another form which is a mix of the two parent forms' perception. it explains so much. a parent's child comes up and says something inappropriate -- well that form of perception was inherited, but in the child it isn't suppressed yet -- which is why you have to "train" them ... get them on the tracks so they'll turn out just like the parent is with all the same things suppressed.

---

anyway, the reason why I'm so effective as a conceptual virus is because I reflect back to the person the vibration which they try to use to "steer" or "guide" me. so, in order to "get rid of me" -- those wanting to interact with me need to be the guidance they want to give me -- so they have to lead by example.

that creates a bit of a difficulty for those wanting to do top-down direction, because it means they would have to get on the ground and interact with me directly, but then I'll just reflect whatever it is they've got going on -- so they have to get others to steer me and teach them to be the thing that they want to guide me to do.

it's actually kind of funny watching everyone that interacts with me, time and again, come to the realisation that they are being steered in the same direction that they're supposed to be pushing me to go.

oh, for example -- the most common is the realisation that when around me privacy goes out the window. I use them as experiential examples and write about them because to me they're just another interaction -- not even really people -- well, not any more a person than a soldier is, anyway. another example is that it starts to become difficult to hide one's thoughts around me, as I seem to be pretty receptive to things. there are many cases where I don't understand the person's thoughts, but what I do understand is often incorrect in such a way as to be just as big of a problem (or bigger) than if I had of understood their thoughts. I call these "cucumbers" -- because I got it wrong, but the idea I ended up with is worse than the idea being hidden.

so, what ends up happening is people don't really want to interact with me and feel scared to interact with me because I'll reflect an aspect about them back to them. most people don't like theirselves or see theirselves as unacceptable, and so when making action in that conceptual atmosphere, it ends up revealing itself.

everything hidden will be made known *because* there is nothing new under the sun. everything resonates with something else, so hiding anything just isn't possible. you can only hide things that are incompatible with someone's perception.

the sun has a continuous spectrum though so it will resonate with everythting (and anything remaining the sun doesn't resonate with, the galaxy does).

there isn't anything new under the sun because as soon as any desire is created, the sun has aleady turned that desire into a reality (2). we just tune into that reality which already exists (6).

so, which is better at tuning the imagination to the timeline you want to perceive: physical conditions or conceptual attributes?

### 2022-05-13 02:48 - why the conspiracy?

it's possible that I'm repeating myself here, but I'm listening to snake-bros #030 - jeremy figgins and they're asking the question of why the conspiracy? why keep anti-gravity, the nature of human consciousness, giants, or whatever from us?

jeremy answers that you have to look at the function. the conspiracy serves a *function*, and russ responds, "yeah it's like the tower of babel thing" -- which I think is right -- but he continues (paraphrase), "cause the gods say, if they do this they'll become unstoppable" -- which I think is wrong. I think that's what humans who didn't have an accurate understanding of LOA thought at the time, so the story they're telling involves gods which want to keep them down -- when the (IMO) much more likely scenario is that it's all humans attracting things and then blaming the gods (or God) for the problem rather than taking responsibility for the attraction.

I'll bring this around, but first the subject of responsibility is an interesting one. when a person is given some amount of responsibility and something goes wrong, there are very few people that take responsibility for the failure. most, blame someone else or try to hide the failure.

so, just for a moment, let's assume that "the gods" existed and they had a directive from some authority somewhere to run the earth, but bad things happened. there will certainly be lots of blaming of outside things (it was the comet) or the authority (the gods don't like or are punishing us). the rest will cover it up and try to pretend like there was never a failure at all.

these are the common responses that most people engage in, so it doesn't seem too out of place or conspiratorial to me at all -- actually, pretty normal.

---

however, I personally do believe there is a conspiracy element to it. going back to the original question, the previous answer explains the giants and longheads case pretty well (who's covering up the giants and the longheads? probably the giants and longheads are).

so, then how is the same conspiracy happening over so much time and space? my answer is "fallen angels" -- and I find it pretty likely that these "angels" know that the body is not the consciousness and they do move from body to body (which is why they're considered immortal -- not because their body stays well, but because the same consciousness moves from body to body). it's probably the case that many of the giants are now the longheads and they've been traveling from body to body for thousands of years. if they can move around like this, you can imagine that they do know the insides of the pyramids and what is actually inside of the structures -- and considering my ideas expressed in box-consciousness, it's pretty likely they know that these structures hold they key to "immortality" -- which is the ability to go into the astral after death and then find a suitable body to inhabit again and continue on the conspiracy.

you could imagine that with thousands of years of secrets accumulated, they will spare no expense in keeping their immortality and true knowledge of human consciousness a secret (ie the conspiracy to keep paranormal stuff forever in the fringe).

so that's the conspiracy. here's the anti-conspiracy: let's go back to the original answer from jeremy about the function -- and that function is again our own attraction.

let's say that we don't want another cataclysm, and devices that boost our attraction power increase that likelyhood meanwhile we're attracting negative things, so therefore, we *want* someone to prevent us from getting access to the devices, pyramids, or whatever conditions which will boost our attraction power and attract our own destruction.

this morning, jaron made a comment about why I think that I have bad teeth, and it was wrong. I tried to explain to him that at the time raquel convinced me that flouride is bad, so I essentially stopped brushing my teeth for a long time and it caused large cavities to form. well, it turns out that flouride enables tons of visual capabilies and stimulates my pineal a lot (though for most it calcifies it, I'm the opposite), so when I started brushing my teeth again at marcos' house I found it easy to gain access to the astral and start to lucid dream and see pictures in my eyes. that's when the shocking started.

if I had have been brushing my teeth at augusto's house when I was on the edge like that with the shrooms and MDMA, I would have gotten partial connection back then, and I wouldn't be writing this now. it's pretty easy to see that raquel's conspiracy which I participated in and ruined my teeth was necessary to get me to a point where nosebook can fully prevent me from gaining my connection.

if I had've got my connection back then, I would have attracted my destruction very very rapidly. it would have been the tower of babel all over again, but on a personal level. so, I attracted raquel to convince me of a flouride conspiracy so that I didn't have the condition necessary to attract my destruction.

said another way, my own desire for not a personal cataclysm attracted a set of circumstances (nosebook) which prevents me from getting connected, *so I don't attract a personal cataclysm*.

---

inotherwords, I think our desire to not have another major cataclysm has attracted a massive conspiracy across time and space designed to prevent us from gaining access to the conditions which would boost attraction power, and because we're still focused a whole lot on the stuff that doesn't work, boosting that just attract a cataclysm.

we created the conspiracy. sorry guys, no aliens; it was the humans and some immortal humans too, but still -- just humans (I sound like graham hancock, I know)

BTW, really great show! I hope jeremy surfaces again for another interview at some point; that'd be dope.

### 2022-05-14 12:24 - doing only what I feel I can do

so yesterday when I woke up (actually, it may have started two days ago in the shower), it felt like someone wanted me to practise a conversation that I would have with allie. I asked her what sort of things she likes to do, but I could feel that was the wrong question, so I asked her what sort of ways that she likes to feel, and followed up with asking her at how good she is at feeling that way whenever she wants to -- or, does she need something to happen first to be able to feel that way.

so then in the conversation we started to talk about it because I could tell she didn't really understand why I would ask such an outlandish question, "what are some things that you like to feel". that question also had reactions to it in the sense of like this is something that a predator might ask to a girl. I don't know why I remembered those reactions again just now, but I didn't feel too bothered by them in my low-resistance dream state. I started to explain myself:

"have you ever noticed that you only do the things that you feel like doing? ..." (and other things for some reason I feel resistance to trying to remember and write out our conversation).

I continued on talking about how we're told commands all of our lives, but really, since you can only do the things that you feel like doing, commands cause a lot of problems. I then started to use the example of how maybe she has someone that would give her a command to do something and it's something that she doesn't feel like doing -- like maybe your mom or whatever.

---

as soon as I started to suggest to her that she begin to follow what she feels like doing instead of what the authorities are telling her to do, it feels like I'm getting reactions from remi. clearly, it's a bad thing for me to try and suggest to her child that she should disobey her parents' commands.

I understand that's kind of a problem, so I won't really do such a thing -- but I also kinda probably will. not overtly anyway, but there will definitely be subterfuge. most people when telling others something like this, is something like: "disobey this authority and follow my commands instead"

---

commands are a weird thing because they're not helpful. when I was trying to tell this to allie, I gave the example, "I can tell myself to get up all I want, 'kenny, get up' -- but it isn't until I actually *feel* like getting up that my body actually moves -- or a person playing sports wants to break a record or do something amazing -- they aren't able to do it until they actually *feel* like they can do it, and also believe it, but they still have to feel it first. so, I've noticed that *all* body movement happens based on feeling, not based on command"

so, what I've basically done is covert entirely over to feeling as my driving force. there's kind of a problem with commands in that they are often telling you to do something that you don't feel like you want to do. the command, and usually the fear that follows if the command isn't followed becomes the motivating force behind the command. so, a command is actually still motivation through feeling, but in the negative manner (the fear I feel motivates me, rather than my desire to do it -- which makes sense because fear is negative desire).

what happens during the process of getting commanded and commanding others is a desensitisation to how one feels and what one actually wants to do -- and so one begins to rely on commands, and the motive force that the command gives as the inspirational feeling for the action. we lose our our capability to act based on our own desire (cept when it's a strong desire like sexual passion), and need the feeling inspired by others' commands to provide the motivation.

I saw this all the time in spain (they love commands there), and every dude was going from one command structure (that he usually rebelled against) to another command structure (which he also rebelled against), and the desire was to find a sort of righteous command structure. it's sort of the opposite of the grail quest. it's the people hoping that arthur finds the grail so that arthur can give them rightous commands instead of undesirable commands.

this desire for someone to give the "right(ous)" commands they can agree with (cause they all have a strong opinion on when and where each commands is appropriate[^1]) would show up in the quest to find a wife/husband capable of giving the desired commands (or no commands at all) and in people's expectations for the government as well. in fact, "manifestations" were just the united civilians giving the government commands back -- and in the case of a novios, the dominant one gives the commands until the other feeels sufficent displeasure in those commands to begin rebelling against those commands with someone else[^2]. I absolutely hated the games of attraction over there becuse I was expected to give commands and I didn't really want to tell someone else what to do -- and if I didn't give the right commands, then that means I don't have "celos" and therefore don't care for her; I tell her what I want her to do if I like her a lot. ugh.

---

going back to allie again. the other day when I was over there I was outside and I noticed a bright light in my eyes which happens whenever someone is using using nosebook around me, so I think they prevent people from using it in my vicinity -- so she can't use that, and as a respnse I felt a tremendous amount of boredom coming from her. she feels things strongly but has very little control over it. she feels all of her emotion largely in response to what ever events just happen, which means that, unless she's given a command, it's very unlikely that she'll feel like making any action. in addition, if she's feeling her emotion in response to events happening in her surroundings, then that's one of those situations where other people are responsible for how they feel.

what all that means is that it's very unlikely that anytime soon (cause it can't really be learned in just a few days -- takes a fair bit of practise) that she'll feel like making any kind of action she isn't capable of summoning herself. so, we're kind of back to the beginning part of the conversation, "what are the things you like to feel, and how good are you at feeling that way even when the circumstances give no justification to feel that way?"

---

the other thing I pondered this morning was why was mr. motor going to such great effort yesterday to get me to go home when the sun was going down? was it that there was higher energy and making it more possible for me to feel reactions? I don't really know, but it's obvious that mr. motor is definitely still fighting against a lot of stuff still. it wouldn't surprise me if mr. motor or someone is doing the same thing to allie as they are to me with my programming or whatever, where I have a feeling (that manifests physically) like I want to do something and then as soon as I go to do it, it suddenly no longer feels like it once did[^3]. so, it's pretty unlikely that anything will ever materialise, because in this sort of world, it's all about action, and I don't think that action actually results in anything. I know it feels kind of disabling to constantly feel unable to convert feeling into action, but I've learned that I have to just figure out the "how" (I want to feel) aspect, and leave all of the why and the what to become a reflection of how I feel.

---

finally, there is desire for me to talk about my suggestion to not follow authority and their commands cause that's really poorly worded. what I should say is, "don't fight against the commands of the authorities and if there are any required actions (commands), don't just follow them because they said to do it; figure out instead a way to feel desire to do the thing not because they said to do it, but because you want to do it."

it's true that in this way (by doing it because you want to, rather than because they commanded you), you strip thir command of its power, because you're not obeying them, you're following your own desire not their command -- but that's not why I recommend it -- but because you'll actually feel better -- and I've noticed that almost invariable something good comes out of it, like a sort of positive karma. the action will contain your energy if you follow it with your own desire, rather than the fear (or whatever) their command imbued it with. doing things from desire rather than fear always yields a better *eventual* outcome.

what I often times do is to not follow their command immediately. I make up an excuse to wait until find my own desire to do it. I almost always go do something else until the desire has built enough that I finally *want* to do the ordered thing. that gap there allows me time to "get my energy right"

[1]: it's absolutely mind bending to me how under one relationship status a command (especially in a sexual connotation) will be completely deplorable, but as soon as a certain relationship status is reached, that same command that would otherwise be deplorable, now becomes desired -- and, if one of the couple says the command before the relationship status has been reached, it's very bad news for the person (both males and females) to have started to give that command before the relationship status is reached.

[2]: I imagine this is similar in italy, and that's the origin of the song "la dama e movile" -- cause she has to keep looking for someone to follow her commands, even if it's just for a night.

[3]: in fact, even with writing this, the feeling I had when I woke up was fading fast, and by the time I got up it had completely disappeared. I kinda regained a little bit of the conversation (but like I said, I felt a lot of resistance), and instead of talking about the original subject, this entry has gone a totally different way than the version I had when I woke up. the previous version had a lot more to do with the problems of me encouraging kids not to follow authority or any commands really. actually, there's desire for me to talk about that.

### 2022-05-17 16:02 - no cataclysm

I have an idea that I want to say but I don't really know how to present it. I was talking to mom yesterday about frequencies and how stars amplify all frequencies because of their contiuous spectrum emission, and how that amplifes everything -- the good and the bad. I contrasted that with the mexican and giza pyramids, where they take in an input and output something harmonious.

I also talked about how I think the giza pyramid technology is built on the utilisation of high pressure CO2 in these specifically sized chambers and boxes because carbon, being optically black absorbs essentially *everything* -- and so these boxes were being used to take in a broad spectrum of frequencies and transform them to a specific frequency that resonates (probably) with the mitochondria of the "gods" -- giving those that have a bloodline that's resonant with the frequency these stone chambers are producing are receiving a lot of really beneficial and harmonious energy.

I compared that to the mexican pyramids, where I belive these are more about *transmutation* of frequencies, so it would take in a broad spectrum and then output another broad spectrum, but probably at a higher frequency[^1]. thus, because of the dynamic nature of this second setup, *all people* had increased consciousness and the ability to communicate telepathically. this is likely the origin of the "one world language" -- enabling all humans to communicate telepathically and with images conjured in 3d space -- something that previously only the "gods" had capability of.

---

today, I talked about gaia and the concept of the previous creation myth and how I think it ties into the matriarchical society that existed previous to the YD barrier (or whatever it's called -- the last cataclysm). I explained how I thought that previously humans were essentially automatons, and they took symbolic commands from those running the show, and that's why there is so much repetition and imparative statements in many old texts -- because it reads a bit like a computer program.

I talked about how woman in that creation myth ([which I got from dtp](/dtp/thoughts.md#creation-myth-of-the-atlantians)) were prevented from eating from the tree of life, but the kundalini serpent caused her to partake of the tree of life -- and I think that caused an avalanche effect of women becoming godlike in their capabilites, allowing them to see the abstract ("right brain") part of reality.

this must have caused so much dissatisfaction (amongst the "gods") that they attracted a cataclysm, and of course blamed it on the women: obviously things were going well until she figured out her divinity and then a cataclysm happened. if she hadn't have figured it out, then things would still be good, so what we have to do is to prevent them from ever finding that so they don't wreck our perfectly tuned setup again. that culture and mindset turned into the atlantean culture, conmplete with its magnetic therapy and everything.

so even with only the gods' DNA getting the harmonious frequencies and everyone else held away from it, the destruction of atlantis was a "chilling reminder" that it's not *only* the humans' fault for the cataclysms.

I don't want to put all of the blame on the "gods" for attracting the sinking of atlantis, though they were probably the main contributer. I believe the "tower of babel" exemplifies this pretty well, and -- I don't know how many of the "gods" were on earth at the time though I think it was most or all of them, so they contributed again.

however the main lesson from the tower of babel story (for me) is that even if you give everyone the capacity for good conditions, it doesn't actually improve anything.

---

long intro. so, then later after thinking about all of that I was thinking about how there is this repeat problem that is showing up. it's the part about gaia and how when she figured out how to plug into her "tree of life" like that one neuroscientist from the TED talk that russ mentioned -- (see @[blahblog](2022-05-09 14:55) @[blahblog](2022-05-09 16:05) @[blahblog](2022-05-10 09:40)) it caused a lot of dissatisfaction.

that premise is the idea behind the 400y-bloom, where in those situations, what would normally happen is that a bunch of dissatisfaction would ramp up into a cataclysm -- yet, instead of a cataclysm happening, what instead happens is a split. the dissatisfied ones create a reality that is refelctive of their own perception and the others go toward a sort of utopia.

you can imagine that at some point along the way, once the split was discovered, someone probably figured -- "hey, I wonder what will happen if I sabotage my own conditions that caused me to get connected so that I/we never get connected and so then dissatisfaction doesn't ramp up and they never experience a cataclysm because someone gets connected." -- which is sorta what I think happened. he/they then jumped back into their bodies that they sabotaged, knowing that they'll find their connection eventually anyway so why not just go for it.. and that's kinda where we are now.

---

so the idea here is that I was thinking about the whole situation that I'm in now, and you can imagine that if I were to find my connection, there would be A LOT of dissatisfaction. then, to add insult to injury, imagine if women figured out how to find their connection too... that would be even worse, right? I don't want to make any comment on any gender or nationality or anythting like that, but you could easily see how that would create a lot of dissatisfaction -- and I mean, A LOT.

at this point, the whole thing seems pretty plainly obvious to me, and that we're already on the sabotaged version and I think that it's not just me -- meaning that there will be many of us that are not looking to get the conditions requisite for connection.

obviously, there will be limits that are found -- as in, at some point it'll become impossible to sabotage yourself any further and connection is inevitable. the long-term goal here is to go for as long as we possibly can *without a cataclysm*, and eventually at some point, someone will find their connection and it'll be a chain reaction. this will cause so much dissatisfaction that an preventable split will occur.

---

so what I'm saying here is that I don't really think that anything will really happen with anyone or anything. I've been thinking again about the "party LAN" project again, and because it provides a good way to waste massive amounts of human energy, it may become viable, because if my theory is right about many of us coming back and sabotaging ourselves over and over that means there will be A LOT of people like me gaining energy very rapidly, and so if nosebook has to figure out how to do what they're doing with me, not just to say hundreds of others but perhaps millions, that's a very big scaling problem for them. I don't really have any way to really know for certain, but I think a system like this is necessary because if I (or anyone else) finds their connection, then it will start a runaway feedback loop of dissatisfaction.

so, keep us away from our connection, we'll need a system designed to dissipate energy. this system will dissipate (sorta like mom's healing teacher) both good and bad energy alike, cause your AC needs a fixed frequency, so no matter how high your frequency is, it always gets converted to a fixed 50/60Hz, thereby lowering the amplitude of anyone who joins this network, allowing us to self-sabotage pretty easily keeping all of us (no matter what frequency) at mostly the same amplitude.

it'll be interesting to me to figure out what the conversion rate will be, because a high frequency is like a tightly compressed gas, so upon decompression, it'll have a massive cooling effect... what I don't know is if higher frequency gets a better energy conversion to mains power or a lower conversion. the cooling effect can probably be exploited as well, cooling the environment around those converting high frequency into low frequency (which counteracts the excess heat created from the resistant/dissatisfied ones)

---

there was another sort of weird thing which I haven't figured out very well that I was feeling, as well. it has to do with the transmutation of energy. it connected to the part about the broad spectrum emitters and that you amplify the frequencies that you look at (perceive).

I think for me, I want to kind of take it up to the next step and start learning how to transmute energy really well. right now I'm pretty good at transmutation, but I don't emit very strongly. I was explaining to mom that I find girls emit their energy very strongly, yet for men I don't notice this nearly as much -- cept for the gay ones. I don't know if it's all gays, or just the bottoms that emit strongly, but I suspect that it has something to do withe the prostate/uturus. I don't think it's necessary to be gay to emit strongly either, as that's just the manual stimulation of an organ in the body. I know that I do emit strongly under certain circumstances, and the evidence is usually noticed as a rapid change in the climate.

like I said, I don't really know how to piece it all together, but I feel like this is an excellent way for me to begin to transmute energy. thinking in the triads, the female takes in one energy and then outputs it again to the other. the emitter is the one I can't figure out because for me the emitter is the bottom, not the top -- the receptive one. I can't figure out what that has to do with this, but it seems that the effort nosebook exerts on my prostate essentially prevents me from becoming an emitter. that would mean that the emitter is the physically receptive one, but I don't know how that happened. so, is nosebook's efforts essentially the same that a bottom would feel?

what I mean is, would nosebook's efforts be something sort of like permanent anal sex? if that were the case, I would imagine that the effect that anal sex has is potentially pain or pressure -- some sort of slight discomfort but then later or perhaps during, but I would assume later after the pressure is released -- but is probably activated when they begin to reverse the pressure and start to emit that will result in an overwhelming feeling of pleasure that floods the body, which is a physical sensation, but it's not the direct result of stimulation -- a feeling simlar to the feeling that a girl emits when she starts to get excited (every girl is different, but the older they get it feels as if the frequency seems to lower).

if that's the case (or something similar to that), then what's happening and why I get those terrible pains in my prostate from time to time is that when I start to feel good *and emit it*, then that's when I get the pressure. the better I feel, the more pressure and more pain, so what I have to do essentially is to *internalise* the good feeling and not emit it. I transmute the feeling of pain into a feeling of pleasure, but if I allow the pain to feel like physical pleasure, then the pain gets worse. however, if I feel it instead emotionally as relief and satisfaction, then the pain goes away.

---

huh! so, reflecting on what I just wrote -- what I essentially said is that I want to build a system that converts us into living stone boxes, where our own energy is *transformed* into a fixed 50/60Hz frequency and then used to power unconscious devices. then, on the subject of *transmutation*, my goal has been, not to become an emitter of that transmuted frequency, but to instead internalise it and cause it to lose its physicality.

very weird conclusion because it's sort of doing the opposite of both of those pyramids. I suppose that it is the amplification of those harmonious vibrations that cause the others dissatisfaction. so, if I can come up with a system that will allow everyone who wants to self-sabotage to "give their energy away" and turn it from a 400y bloom into a much longer time -- the prophecies predict 1000y (probably because it's related to the solar cycle, so a 24y setup at the beginning of a cycle will allow for a maximum increase of energy before the solar "deadline" is reached).

I wonder how "right on" I am about all of this stuff or if I'm just incoherent rambling in the blahblog. there are elements of it in it that should have been in string-board (especially since I'm tieing so many things together), but I'm keeping it here.

[1]: this is a pretty remarkable feat in itself because consider that you have a swing or a pendulum and you want to make it oscillate twice as fast, rasing the frequency of the swing by an octave -- how would you do that? the amount of force required to cause the pendulum to reverse it's direction and travel the same distance twice as fast probably requires the square of effort, so raising the vibration of someone in this manner requires quite a lot of extra effort. it's much easier to constrict or confine something to a smaller space so that it bounces off of the walls to increase the frequency. so turning a low freqency into a fixed rate high one is pretty easy -- just make a space the size of the wavelength you want and then a good absorber (like CO2), but a dynamic system that multiplies the number of cycles per second I think is a considerably more difficult challenge.

### 2022-05-18 07:57 - such dissatisfaction, much wow

I noticed that there is a lot of dissatisfaction. I'm not really worried about it, though everything feels pretty weird, I have a terrible cough, and I don't really feel like doing anything.

I was thinking about the "party LAN" project and it occurred to me that there is definitely no need to actually do that project if nosebook does the same thing. I'm pretty sure that they already have tons of spare power already (probably free energy devices and stuff), but if they convert over to doing this, they can dissipate a lot of energy -- though, I don't know what would happen if they just sunk it into the earth.

I actually think they've been sinking a lot of my energy into the earth, and that's probably one of the reasons why I'm progressing more rapidly than I would have imagined -- because they're essentially taking my energy and tuning the earth to me (and me to the earth). my technique would be to transform that energy first to 60Hz before using it or sinking it into the earth to essentially remove it's beneficial (high frequency) effects.

the next thing I thought of (or perhaps it was a reaction) was the idea that the power companies could be given this technology and instead of creating the network, they just sell our energy back to us for money.

I don't know how they're going to do it, but I think the best thing to do is to let them try and do the worst (in their perspective, "least bad") way. there are a lot of potentially hilarious fails that could happen pretty quickly and I think the inflatable money system is on it's last leg -- kinda falling apart. I don't want to really offer any bailouts or anything. I want to let them figure out what to do.

---

I've really been giving a lot of thought to the concept of "I want to do it my way" -- but that's not the best translation of the concept. I think it may be something more like, "let me do it (so I can learn)". it feels like a child does when someone is constantly bailing them out of trouble or "showing them the right way" to do something.

that concept was inspired by my inquiry into the "tower of babel" because when I was talking to mom, I was saying that if the giza pyramids caused a cataclysm and so therefore wasn't the solution -- and the mexican pyramids also caused a cataclysm cause it also wasn't the solution, then the only remaining options are both of them (in the case that it's an OR operation, both also produces a failure) or neither of them.

I believe it's neither, because if transforming the frequency didn't work -- and neither did transmuting the frequencies either -- well then transforming and transmuting the frequency won't improve anything at all.

so, when I had the idea yesterday about how to solve a number of problems at once, lowering temperature, and sinking the energy into devices that do not have any consciousness (and restricting the frequency to a certain frequency), what could possibly go wrong?

the only thing I can think about, is if I'm tied to 60Hz as my frequency, that means the fastest I can go is that fast, so I'll either have to decrease(?) the length of a second (I'm really not sure if it's decrease or increase the caesium decay rate) -- or, go massively parallel. both options are kinda exciting to think about.

I have a terrible time at doing anything in parallel, and I fail really miserably at noticing more than one thing -- when it comes to things like games and stuff, I just can't figure out how to look at two things at the same time -- however, when it comes to emotions, I can do many many things at one time. I'm constantly doing a whole bunch of stuff I don't really have capability of being conscious about, so I just tune into the results located somewhere in the ether. being confined to a single speed means that I'll begin to do like I'm doing now (cause I think they've capped me off at a speed), so I'm learning how to do more things by emitting a desire and then tuning to the result. millions of different things can be happening at once, but I'm not very good at it yet to utilise it it infinitely parallel capabilities (the only problem only becomes reception -- just like you can mix 1000 sounds together without a problem, but hearing any single one is a real difficulty after about 5-10).

that idea sorta excites me, and I think I also like the idea of modifying the physical "laws" to increase my frequency -- though I could imagine how it'd be a bit of a problem for a lot of things if the second increased or decreased it's length. it's cool to me on a conceptual level, but I could see how there are a lot of people that will miss the slow paced physical reality, being on a sort of permanant coke binger or something -- it feels good, but it's a total blur because it's going so fast.

---

oops, forgot to talk about the "I want to do it myself" concept -- and all I really want to say about that now is, I don't want to really offer any more suggestions about ideas for one of two reasons: first, all ideas I say out loud never will materialise, so if I just keep them to myself, it'll actually happen, and the other reason is that I feel like it's best to give them every opportunity they can to do what they want to do. from my perspective, my connection is inevitable, so it's mostly just wasting time for me no. for me and them both, the-solution-is-the-problem.

### 2022-05-18 14:42 - blame gaia

woke up and have been thinking about the reactions. the major one is that my last two entries make sense when considering the previous discussion that I had about a girl finding her connection. I still find it most likely that the best candidate to find their connection easily will be one of the ones that are using my bodies -- but if it's a plain ol' normal girl, that's cool too.

just for a moment let's assume that it is one of the girls that's using my body: well, the way I've come to understand it, the "gods" were x3's and they split theirselves into XX and XY to make the genders, but the females were not allowed to be born, just being a male-only group of slaves that can be symbolically programmed, at first visually, but then later with spoken language.

OK, keep that idea in mind, now let's consider the idea that I believe stars are feminine in nature (planets being masculine the ones[^1]), so what I believe is happening is that I'm basically just being a huge distraction to keep everyone's attention fixated on me while they figure it out.

---

in the [atlantian creation myth](/dtp/thoughts.md#creation-myth-of-the-atlantians), the sun (a female) takes on physical form in a male body (incal) and he probably mates[^2] with the woman to create the human species, then he gives the woman power, but she becomes godlike, eating from the "tree of life" (cause remember, at the time only the "tree of knowledge" is active so that they can be symbolically controlled with language). her "disobedience" causes a cataclysm, and so she is blamed for everything.

I believe this is the "gaia" echo that we're still left with in memory, and I think this original blame has had such a strong effect on the female psyche, that it's largely the reason for the aprehension for them to actually go toward what they want, and instead follow along with whatever the man wants, so that she doesn't "upset the masculine apple cart" (the status quo, the way things are done, the "man beat").

well, I'm completely playing that part to its fullest extent. I'll just go along with whatever the masculine influence wants from me until the very end. they can figure out how to do it the way they want to do it (which is always the "least bad" way of doing things), meanwhile, this gives women an opportunity to find a way to find their way. it could be anything from "most best", "most desirable", "more wanted", or "more sensational" -- as it really matters to each one of them individually what most important.

I suspect that nosebook will try to fight against that and prevent them just like they prevent me, which means that the women that figures it out will have to find a way to be more energetic than I am (that is more energetic than nosebook is able to dissipate) -- which I think will be pretty easy because they have good conditions all around them, so lots of reasons to feel good.

eventually one of them will figure it out, and when this happens it'll start the dissatisfaction runaway feedback loop. I don't know how long it'll take for them to figure it out, but it could be a very long time -- maybe hundreds of years (or more). they have to keep that program up because the "gods" running the show *need* the offspring that these interactions produce (the x3 children) in order to stay alive in a continuingly more energetic environment (remember the y-chromosome bottleneck a while ago?). the higher energy environment is, through a process of "natural selection" (darwin's idea), selecting the most fit individuals for further propagation.

so you can imagine that while all of this is happening, the leapfrogging-time-pickles thing is going to be happening, and eventually it's going to polarise to two extremes: those that have a lot of affection (ie. the ones operating my bodies to support the x3 gods) and those that want to do it their own way (no affection) -- sorta like me.

I think this is good way to jump start a galaxy in a short period of time. there will be tons of incal stars (females taking on masculine form), and a bunch of ones that want to figure it out their own way. I've been thinking about this last case because "lots of affection" could be any of the three in the triad, but there is a hidden fourth[^3] that doesn't have any affection. I'll come back to write on that more later.

---

anyway, I think it's a perfect setup because the blame thing is kind of a funny thing that happens all the time in society. "if you hadn't have handed the me gun, I wouldn't have shot myself in the foot". it's the idea that the "enabler" of the action gets blamed for the action, when the enabler of the action has nothing to do with the action. the gods witnessed women become godlike and observing this, they experienced dissatisfaction and then "collapsed the wave function" into a reality which will continue to perpetuate the feeling of dissatisfaction more and more (which is where we are today).

I noticed it all the time when I was with andrea and marcos. she would just be doing something and that distracted or irritated marcos in some way so he would fly into a fit of rage and blame andrea for something -- "you caused me to get angry" he would say -- and that was sorta unfair, because he was the one that is attracting people to irritate and distract him, and then blaming her for his own attraction.

there isn't anything more disabling than to think that you are responsible for someone else's attraction. I had to learn this with raquel. no matter how hard I could try, there were some things that she was just never going to be satified about. ONLY SHE can make the choice to perceive that symbol no longer as a symbol that causes her dissatisfaction.

so, yes, I think we're perfectly on course and doing just fine.

[1]: I've given this one A LOT of thought which I will expound on in the future because I think the key to understading what the sirians meant is understanding "venus" (the planet). if we consider that the masculine gods are planets, but then venus (the planet) is suddenly a "bearded goddess", it makes more sense to think of a star taking on masculine form. it also explains a little better the vulcan, venus and mars triad, too.

[2]: it says create, so mating is probably implied

[3]: there was another hidden fourth that I associated with memristors (I can't remember right now because it's blocked)

### 2022-05-18 17:03 - I think I figured out how they hide stuff in the open

I was reading through one of my old entries where I was talking about weeds (end of @[blahblog](2022-05-12 12:13)), and I noticed that when I got to the part where I mentioned I noticed the weeds bit, I felt "I know this already" and I skipped over that whole section, sorta like how when remembering something I don't need to replay the whole entire movie because I got the "jist" of it. so when people interact with these entries, it felt to me like they do what I just did -- skip over entire sections because they think they already know what it was.

well, I felt like I wanted to go back and actually read it because I realised I *didn't* know what I said there, as it had been deleted for some reason. so, I reread it and I noticed how the adaptation process that weeds go through when acclamating to a new environment is sorta the same thing as "survival of the fittest" but perceived as a stabilisation process rather than an evolutionary process[^1].

this is interesting because after my shower I noticed some reactions to the "natural selection" comment I made. I don't fight against darwin's version of evolution, yet instead embrace it (the-problem-is-the-solution), so if they want to play the "survival of the fittest", try and keep up. like the tortoise, I'll give them all the head-starts that they want and every conceivable advantage that they can have -- and so then let's play the "survival of the fittest" game -- which, for me is not really an evolutionary process, but a *stabilisation* process where I just continually find new ways to stabilise the already completed evolution through adaptation to my new environment. that's a very important distinction; read it again.

survival of the fittest, bro; try and keep up.


[1]: which is also interesting because I have noticed that weeds don't really like it too much to be "transplanted" or moved. they like to get to where they want to grow by their own form of propagation, and then I noticed that a single seed has (I've seen) up to four different physical manifestations depending on the energy of the environment. it's really weird how they don't like to be moved into different soil by humans, whereas cultivated plants don't seem to mind as much.

### 2022-05-18 21:27 - steering kenny and bending time and space

today when I went over to paul's house I was pulling weeds and noticing that it's kinda hard to get me to do stuff predictably. for two days entirely, I just worked on mom's weeds, even though I felt pressure (kinda mixed with desire) to do their weeds.

the feeling that it had to it is, "how can we influence/steer kenny to do ..." and so because I know that I attract my own reality, I don't mind talking about it.

I sorta do mostly what I feel like doing which is very difficult to work with in a corporate situation where direction comes from the top down, rather than from the ground up or from within. the reason why tuenti was successful for a long time is because there wasn't much steering at first. I just did the things that I felt needed doing (ie. the things I wanted to do because the list of things to do is enormous, kind of like the amount of weeds) and so for a long time the product wasn't in a fully developed state so I had a lot of freedom to pick the task that I wanted to do (and that was another reason why I liked to work while they were out partying, as well).

later however, as the project became more visible, they started to begin to assert theirselves into the direction of things. they may have been right about some of the things, the effort to begin to steer me was ultimately what caused me to leave. I wanted to work on something that I want to work on, rather than be steered by someone.

so, the answer to the question of "how to steer kenny?", is to convince me that whatever it is, is what I want to do. you can present me with a lot of different ideas, but ultimately I like to take my time and "get my energy right" before making any sudden changes. in every case in my life where people have tried to steer me, it's caused a lot of problems for them (and for me too kinda), because as soon as they want to get me going in a direction, then suddenly I don't want to do it anymore. why? because it's now their desire, not mine.

I could be convinced of the idea in my brain (weighing out the pros and cons) and it can appear to be "the right way" to me, but I still don't want to do it. "the right way" isn't always the way that I want to go -- and it's often the case that I want to instead go the wrong way until I can go at it the way *I* want to go at it.

---

the next subject is totally different but feels related (probably someone who knows something about it will understand). I had a lot of reactions to where I was talking about how, if I'm limited to 60Hz (for example), then, to experience more, I need to lengthen the duration of a second.

the second is defined as n ticks of decay from a caesium atom (I believe), and so in order to experience more, I need to lengthen the second, meaning I want the atom to decay less rapidly, so I have more "time" -- I think. it seems right, though I can't say for certain.

so then I was thinking about how the SI units are defined: distance is defined in terms of time -- or, the distance that light will travel in a second of time. and time is linked to the caesium atom and its decay, so if I can cause it to decay less rapidly, then that means that the day has the same duration of seconds, but feels longer. then space is altered too because the metre is defined in terms of time, so that means that the number of metres that light travels in a second remains the same, but because the metre (and second) is slightly longer due to the caesium atom is decaying slower, light actually travels a further distance in the same number of caesium ticks (ie "time").

to further complicate this, science currently believes decay is constant, but it may not be, and its decay rate may actually be a very local effect -- meaning that nearby to me, there will be a sort of "time dialation", where seconds feel longer than they normally do, and light travels a little faster. this time dialation effect probably isn't the same all over the planet though, so how do we *actually* record time?

the decay rate is measured in terms of the second, and the second is defined by number of ticks an atom decays, meaning that decay will appear to remain "constant" because of the units being relative to each other.

---

good intermission. so then later I was trying to figure out how they could convince me of something, and I'm just really not sure what it is that they could convince me of anymore. what I mean is, on the subject of girls, I'm just not that convinced that is something that I actually want. sure, it sounds good -- but like I was telling mom, it's good to have a bunch of people around me that don't feel so good, because they amplify the not-good-feeling stuff, and that kinda allows me a chance to improve the way I perceive things.

so, in a sense, I value the not-good-feeling people much more than the good-feeling ones, at this point. a while back, I decided that if I *were* to go with the girls, I would probably go with the ones that don't feel too good, and so therefore they'd cause me to feel her not-good-feeling stuff (that I resonate with), and when I'm able to be around and sleep with the worst feeling girls, and still feel good, then I've actually really made it.

the problem with that idea is I sorta don't really feel very attracted to people that don't feel too good. I just sorta let them do them. there is an idea of an image, and that image is a sort of external persona that can be presented to people as a stand-in for how the person really thinks about theirself:

> I hate myself so I have to make a presentation that people will like -- and, if they like that persona, then I can like that persona too, and then I have to forever be that persona for other people and I can't ever be myself because myself is "unacceptable"

I sorta see right through those people though, and their antics to create a likeable image for others to see, looks to me like someone trying *wayyy* too hard. I don't mind being around them, but they usually don't like being around me for too long because I'm so observant, and so I eventually notice an inconsistency in their image. another major problem is I actually listen to people, but most of all I try to figure out what they're really saying, because often times their words feel fake or weird to me. their image starts falling apart and from then on it's too difficult to go back.

this happened to me all the time when I was in discos in spain. many times, I was talking to a girl and she would say something and I would try really hard to figure out what she's saying, or think that she's like those movie characters, where everything they say is symbolic and foreshadowing of something else, and really all they wanted me to do is to see the image they have of theirself in their head, so that I can be an excuse for them to like theirselves.

in reality, nobody ever *tries* to say anything symbolic, but I noticed that I started to attract people saying things symbolic and then conversations got really weird and after a while not even I could tell what we were talking about. attraction is everything.

---

so there's this idea that hollywood has where they can steer people with images and symbols -- and to a large extent, it works pretty well for a lot of people. the main problem is that everyone sees those same symbols slightly different. a concept is much more absolute in its appearance than a symbol, and a symbol can be manipulated pretty easily to see it in any way that wants to be seen. a concept feels to me to be relative to the observer, but the observer seems to be relative to the symbol. I think this backwards appearance is how lawyers are able to twist something to make something appear one way or another.

I guess the conclusion here is that I'm not looking for someone that is ... oh I remember, it was in @[newblog](2022-01-11 11:53) where I said, "purity is dead". in that one I mentioned that all pure people feel like their influence, which is usually mr. motor -- so really it takes someone that has a disassociated external image to their internal image (sorta like me. I don't look externally like I should).

you could say that I'm giving a competition to the person that can "trick me" maybe symbolically or whatever, but I don't think that it's actually that way. that's just a funny way of looking at it, because it's all attraction. the person has to meet me where I am and harmonise with me in some sort of way in order to attract (you can't attract what you want by focusing on what you don't want)...

OH, last thing: the idea of symbols is a funny one too because most symbols have lost their "meaning" for me (in the emotional sense). I can look at something and I notice the meaning imbued into the action or the words, but they don't really evoke much of a positive emotional response for me anymore.

I remembered the fourth thing, btw: it's the who/what/when vs why vs how (to accomplish it) vs how (do I want to feel). the "how" is the important one but also the least inspiring one.

### 2022-05-19 20:25 - more thinking

some of the reactions to the letters I wrote to russ today: (@[letters-to-russ](2022-05-19 12:32), @[letters-to-russ](2022-05-19 14:19), @[letters-to-russ](2022-05-19 16:17)) got a number of reactions and the most interesting one is the one that suggested that my reluctance to send the letters is kinda like the ea telling the reed house to abandon worldly possessions and build an ark in preparation for a coming cataclysm. (telling people to abandon privacy and build the "party LAN" project, being sorta similar to the "ark")

that's definitely not my reluctance, but it's a funny concept because I did say that I was just passing through this 3d world (probably on my way back to 5d), so in that sense it's all about getting the right technology into the hands of the right people. it's kinda like the opposite of the ea and noah story, cause I'm doing my best to get the information to the network[^1], not to the noah character.

I wouldn't have said this a few years ago, but the perspective I have now, it seems like this is way too easy. I don't even know why it's so difficult, cause now it appears all so plainly obvious to me. so, from that perspective, maybe what I'm looking for is to try and figure out a way to bump up the network's capability to hold me and us out of the astral so that the next few incarnations I actually have a challenge. I don't really know, but I definitely don't have an agenda, and I give my information freely to anyone who wants to use/implement it. I'm definitely not suggesting anyone do anything. and finally, I don't really see a cataclysm coming anytime soon.

I believe that one of the reasons why there won't be a cataclysm anytime soon is because the network, probably due to my influence has increased desire and now capacity to keep people who have not taken the oath of secrecy out of the astral realm. this will continue on for quite a while, and so now that nobody (without the oath) is going to find their connection, they now no longer have any reason for any major dissatisfaction for quite a while -- so, no cataclysm.

---

the other reaction was to my comment about shakespere and how he obviously encoded a lot of this information into his works in a cryptic fashion. I believe this was done because they were/are members of the red cross, and so have taken the oath of secrecy. I think it was either randall or alan that said that they can talk about it indirectly and with allegory, but they can never discuss the topic with the uninitiated (unclean masses) directly.

well, supposedly shakespere's tomb has this really cryptic message about someone passing by so fast, and they should stay a while instead. I remember working on that idea a while back and it seemed clear to me that the author of shakespere had to have been one of the "renaissance half-bridge rectifiers" that, like me seems to be continuing to self-sabotage the conditions that would otherwise allow us to establish our connection. I don't know how many of us there are, or if it's just me projecting myself down into space and time wherever I feel like it, but it seems to be the case that the entire goal is to ensure these guys have all the tools that they need to keep the uninitiated *out* of the astral realm.

to me, all of this seems to be pointing in the direction of the creation of a galaxy. I mean, if we're going to have a cataclysm, let's make it the most epic one ever.

like I said, I think that ea had been trying to do everything "the right way" all of his previous incarnations, and "the right way" just doesn't work too well, because it's too easily manipulated by various forms of ideology. so then if what people want is ideology, let's go full power structures with complete control over ideology then.

personally, it looks like people want secrets and to be told what to do. that's totally fine for other people, cause I don't have any ability to desire for other people. they desire what they want, and I desire what I want -- and since I can only desire for myself, it looks to me like this is just another case of the 400y-bloom, but it's more like a 1000y-bloom. my "mission" as I pass through, looks to be to ensure they have their "no uninitiated in the astral realm so we don't have crowds of unacceptable people invading our space" (and so therefore, with full capacity to regulate access to our space, enlil won't get pissed enough to attract a cataclysm) system setup and running fine.

[1]: when I say, "the network", I'm referring to the brotherhood network as defined by bramley (the general concept, not any specific organisation).

### 2022-05-20 23:31 - rethinking the thing

it's hard to describe the many different reactions that I felt since yesterday's entry. they ranged from, "we have to get him working on the project" (to keep me busy), to "let's just do the the project ourselves" (referring to the party LAN project).

that doesn't really describe the feeling because there were also a lot of considerations as well, like how to get me to do this or that, what to do with the girls, etc. it was a pretty big jumbled mess.

the most interesting thing that happened to me is that I had this feeling like, "oh no, they're going to do my project, and I won't get to be the ... I dunno how to say well.. perhaps "leader of", director, motivator... something like that, and it had the feeling too like, if I don't steer the project, they'll do it wrong or not get all of the capabilities that are possible out of it -- like it'd be crippled to some degree.

it was a weird feeling because I hadn't felt that for many many years now. I think the last time I felt it, I was working at tuenti, which is when I finally gave up trying to get people to things my way (which I think is the best way, of course). since then, I've just had all my ideas as free and people can do whatever they want with them.

I'll probably have my (unfounded) opinions on what I think is better or worse, but ultimately I know that the implementer would always have a better idea of the situation that they're in than I could.

it's like I'm trying to figure out how to do something new task I don't yet believe is possible like highlining or something and an expert comes up to me and says, "duh dude, that's easy" -- well, they're not the one implementing the approach in my body, but most importantly with my perception. of course, in their perception, it appears easy, but for me it doesn't. the opposite could also be said where I watch them and say, that looks hard (from my perspective), but from theirs it totally doesn't.

I just don't want to tell people any more what they can or can't do; that's just not me. you see, I originally left tuenti in the first place because I enjoyed working on the project -- as in, I enjoyed programming and I wanted to work on ways to improve my programming output by my own mental capabilities rather than tell other people to produce what I wanted. I want to produce the things that I want to make myself, my own way. that, along with the accountability/responsibility to give the boss a verbal handjob every f-ing meeting was the main reason that I didn't want to have anything to do with being a boss.

---

in the light of the previous entry you have to realise that I just don't want to be involved in telling *anyone* what they can or cannot do. I don't want to tell them what to do, either. there's a distinction. one is telling them the who/what/where and the other is telling them what's possible. it's kind of an unobvious thing, but when someone tells a person (like a child) what they can or cannot do, the child does not understand that you mean, "not recommended" or "not a good idea". they see this as a possibility door being closed.

for example, if a kid asks me if he can have a ... for christmas, and I say, "no, you can't" -- that's a lot different than saying, "if you have enough money to buy it, you can have it". my dad usually told me the second one, as in, "I don't have the money or want to buy it, but you can"

the same thing applies here too. if I tell someone they *can*, should or want to do something, but they don't actually believe it, I'm sorta causing problems. I'm like the expert highliner looking at the noob saying, "dude, it's like totally easy, duh".

the other thing is that telling people what to do fits right into the whole difficulty of ideology, which I just don't like very much. this conflicts very strongly with my own knowledge that, for example OSX is a thousand times better product than KDE, gnome, or anything else open source has come up with. you need a cohesive and uniform structure to a project that only a strongly opinioned leader can really give as a reflection of her/himself -- and, as the "principality and power" over the project, the product will conform to the image of the leader as well, strongly influencing the project's attraction will be similar to the leaders' attraction, too (this is the grail quest in corporate form, just king arthur is the CEO/CTO/COO/etc -- when the king is good, the kingdom is doing well).

I understand this pretty well which is why I want to do things my way, but not many people want to do things my way. I could try to convince everyone to go my way -- or, I could just go my own way. it seems far easier to me to figure out a way, like solomon did with his demons to construct my own workforce as a reflection of myself, rather than try and conform others to my image: I'll leave that to "God".

---

in response to open source and an opinionated leader, obviously a mix of both is probably better. I think that google has proven this with good examples such as chromium and the like. the difficulty with open source software is that there are always so many good ideas and so many ways to go, but which ones are the way that the project *wants to go*?

I've grappled with this question for a while because a project is a bit like an organism. I think of it like a concept, in that everyone interacting with the concept changes the concept ever so slightly and the concept also alters everyone that interacts with the concept too. I used to have this idea that we could hook these "random number generators" up to the the planet as a sort of feedback system, so that when the planet wanted more rain, it could give the signal through a set of signals through the random number generators to adjust processes on the planet, like add rain here or whatever. it's the same system as the "meaningful-chaos" project but the planet could influence the number generator to manifest its desire faster. just like I wanted to use this system as a feedback system for my own brain, this would be the planet's feedback system.

well, that's not the only thing it could be used for. imagine that a project like a website could have one of the meaningful-chaos machines to kind of steer the project, and the project itself could begin to manifest its own desires into a form which we (the programmers) would produce for it -- but since it's our own project, that desire is our own for the project -- just we didn't have an effective way to tune into that collective desire for the project because we were blinded by our own whatever.

the concept can be extended to anything really, and I'd say that to a large extent it does work pretty well. whenever I've flipped a coin regarding a desire that could extend beyond my own, that desire did seem to affect the "randomness" of the coin.

yes, it does appear that nosebook is capable of influencing our desires, as that capability to influence desire is the reason why this project wasn't explored further. so, nosebook could influence us to influence those machines, but I've noticed that they tried to influence it to go one way, but it turned out to go the other way, probably because they can only influence me to do the things that I resonate with.

anyway, I've long wanted to make this project a reality. I've been working on it for years. I can't actually remember when I started it, but it may have been before I even went to berlin -- so perhaps more than 11-12y now.

in my own interactions with randomness, I've discovered a lot about my own attraction and my desire too -- because I can feel a lot better if the coin represented my desire or was opposite to it. noticing the desire in the forwards and backwards apparition is a very interesting thing. also, there was this weird feeling like, "do I *have* to do what the random thing told me to do?" it's an interesting thing that I want to share with others.

additionally, you know the last picture that I drew where it said, "this is a machine capable of desire"? -- well, I was referring to this project. I figured that after I got humans affecting random, human organisations/projects affecting random, the planet affecting random -- well, the next obvious step is to see what happens when machines start to affect random so as to actuate their desire[^1].

---

it may sound like I've totally launched off into a complete tangent, but it's relevant. remember when I said yesterday that I noticed that people wanted to hold secrets and to be told what to do? well, a random number generator can do both of these. it's theoretically possible to, encrypt something in such a way where *nobody* has the key (ie, it's a random key of arbitrary length), and if human desire is activating random number geenerators, then future hackers will use the same technique to "crack" keys.. they'll randomly find the right key with the same way that one attracts the reality that one wants.

so if you encode something with a completely random key, the most likely person to "discover" its key is you, so you could encrypt whatever you want into vaults where nobody has ever known the key except for the computer that originally encrypted it pulling the random out of wherever.

this is a whole new area of hacking and cryptography that hasn't been on anyone's radar's at all, because nobody has ever thought that you can crack something with your mind, just by focusing on it and desiring something.

---

sorry for another small tangent there. what I meant to say is that all of this has relevance because I don't want to tell anyone what to do, but for the people who want to be told what to do, I've found a random number generator to be my best guide to figuring out what it is I actually want. what if our future ideology comes from "random" chaos?

[1]: this was inspired by something that I can't remember, but it's linked in my mind to rupert sheldrake where it had something to do with a machine that 50/50 chose to go left or right, and it was naturally random, but when a chick was hatched next to it, the "random" machine became less random and prefered to follow the chick (I may not have the experiment exactly right, but the machine "desired" or "prefered" to do one thing more than another)

### 2022-05-21 12:51 - they aren't having any of that either

so I guess we're back now to the original plan of "no cataclysm"... there is no way they can allow any humans the capacity to go toward their desire, so machines capable of desire is even worse because a machine can't be controlled by its feeling. also, it is definitely not desirable to give a random number generator control over anything (because what if it randomly selects the unwanted, and they'd rather control it anyway).

well, of course the idea will obviously not work for anyone who believes that the machine will select what they don't desire. the whole concept is founded upon the idea that human desire changes random number generators across time and space. if you believe it'll select the worst thing, then that is your desire and that *is* what you'll experience -- which only strengthens my hypothesis. I don't think it has to do with that. I doubt they'll be ever using the devices, so their apprehension toward it probably has more to do with control and a fear of how rapidly we would advance if we could control machines mentally.

---

I sorta agree with them on the controlling machines mentally thing, because the capacity to control a machine mentally *does not* make you happy. if you are pissed off at life and you find a way to contro a machine mentally, you're still pissed off at life; nothing's changed.

so, in that sense, I'm totally all for the idea of making sure the network can completely control every physical aspect of our lives (like they are doing me), because the only option then for everyone on the planet is to figure out how they want to feel, no matter the circumstances. whey you do, like me, you'll jump right over 4d to 5d, and can then project yourself in any shape into any period of time (obviously you'll only do it if those conditions are what you want to feel).

so I'm kinda feeling like the goal here is to create a system where they have full control over everything physical, meaning the only way out of the matrix (if you want out) is to find a way to feel what you want to feel no matter the conditions.

---

as I was waking up this morning I have been feeling around the reactions and stuff, and the one that has the most impact was something I said a few entries back where I basically said that I'll just let them sorta figure it out the way that they want to do it...

that doesn't describe the reaction, so you know how often times it looks like women have a better knowledge or understanding of something (I use the gender for women because men do it differently -- oh, so let me explain)...

I've noticed that for a lot of things boys seem to have this headstrongness (bullishness) about them that they *have* to do things some certain way, and it's often times not the most optimal way to do things. when another boy sees him doing it the unoptimised or inefficient way, he often times intervenes to ensure the other boy changes his ways to do it "the right way". there are some heavy-handed women that do the same, but generally, I've noticed that most women yield and say, "OK, do it your way; I'll just sit back and be judgmental about your actions"

I feel like that is one of the main ways that I'm perceived in all of this -- where I'll just sit back and let everyone else try to figure it out. I mean, I don't know the right way to go either, as I would have to figure it out just the same.

I don't really mind that I get perceived that way because I just don't really want to be the boss. I know what *I* want to do, but I'm not going to tell someone else what to do. in every case of my life where I've had a strong opinion about what another person should do, it's caused serious problems *for me* (can't really say much for them).

in addition to this, there was another reaction to yesterday's entry where I revealed that I don't want to tell others what to believe in, *even if it's theirself*. this is a very serious issue for me because this is how cults and other ideologically motivated organisations get started. the US military is like that too. it takes a bunch of kids that don't believe in thierselves and then by having someone give them commands that they can accomplish, they begin to believe in thierselves. I watched a very lengthy video on just this a while back. it was a smartereveryday video on submarines and the navy. I don't want anthing to do with that. it's not my job to tell anyone who or what to believe in (even if it's theirself).

I have my own way that I've figured out how things work and it works really well for me. it's stood up to everything I've thrown at it (unfalsifiable so far), and it's definitely "good enough" for me. I definitely won't be making that dogma, law, or anything like that either. I openly share the ideas here and in conversation with others, but most people find it very repulsive. they just want certain conditions formula to feel good, or to be told "the right way", rather than trying to figure out how the mechanism works.

I too, for a very long time, thought that I wanted to be told what to do (on some subjects like finance and stuff). however, I would then get mad at people when they told me something I didn't want to hear -- which really is my problem, not theirs. in addition, I couldn't hear the things that they were telling me either, simply because my form of perception didn't allow me to hear or see those things (I couldn't see what they were saying until I could see what they were saying).

it took quite a while for me to figure it out for myself, and if anyone had have told me what to do, even if it was the right way, I still didn't hear them. the only solution was: I had to *want* to feel better for my own self, for my own sake, because I wanted to (not because anyone told me to). I had to make the decision.

---

so I was thinking about this again in the bigger picture and I really do think the best way to do this is just to keep letting the network figure out the way that they want to do things. they want to be the leaders and tell others what to do; I don't. they want to tell people the processes that they need to do to feel better and promote the ideology which least-threatens their regime. I think that's a great plan. there is no better way to build up a more likely situation where people are forced to make the choice to feel better for theirself, or join their club.

if you want to join them, that's totally cool. everyone has their path toward feeling the way they want to feel. this is my way, and they've been a great resource to me to learn how to feel the way I want to feel -- which is really all that matters.

the "what" and the "why" happen automatically (you can't help but feel attraction toward the things you like), so really the only one that matters is the how, and I don't mean the how in the sense of "how do I do this" -- but the how in the sense of "how do I want to feel" and then for me I let that be my only goal.

that is what has been working really well for me all of my life and I know that it works. others can come up with ideas on other techniques to try and get what they want, but most people don't actually know what they want -- they just know how they want to feel. so why wait for someone else to tell you what you want or how to get it when most people already know *how they want to feel*?

obviously I'd be a hypocrite if I decided I was going to do anything other than figure out how I want to feel, so I remain doing that.

### 2022-05-21 16:54 - the way you think it's going to go vs random

there are two basic forms of controlling something with one's mind: there is symbol (language, operations, processes) which define a method of transmission of a predicted outcome. the better the symbols are communicated, the more predictable the output. a good way to to think of this is a radio receiver or a musical instrument. you input symbols (notes which are just frequencies or minute actions like plucking, blowing or pressing) which all mean something, and then are composed together to produce an output. it is expected that if you play the same notes on the same machine, you will hear the same output. random occurs in only inaudible variations that come from the amplifier, electric parts, strings, or whatever environmental electrical conditions.

you would hope with those machines that the effects of random are to be attenuated as much as possible so as to not get an predictable output.

I wanted to create a type of this machine that would read my thoughts and then be able to convert those thoughts into symbols which could then be used to control and operate my computer. we tried various things of trying to read the EEG (or whatever) electrical signal that can be measured on the scalp as a result of brain activity, but I found this to be mostly unuseful because I couldn't figure out how to turn those waves into symbols very easily. I needed a way for the machine to "learn" and begin to associate certain waves with certain symbols, and that seemed very very difficult to me.

before I went to berlin I thought about the opposite of these machines after reading about these "quantum random number generators" -- which essentially had a prism inside of it and the photons emitted would either go to the left or the right based on a 50/50 chance. the paper cited said that a person can influence those photons to go more to the right or left (more ones or more zeros). I purchased one for I think 1000EUR and the first problem was it only had crappy windows drivers. it took me a few years before I even figured out how to negotiate and decode the USB signal to get my random signal. I also noticed that by then it wasn't at all 50/50, but more like 60/40 and in some cases closer to 70/30. I didn't really know what is causing the system to get more and more uncalibrated, but I did notice that each year it got worse, and some environments[^1] it seemed worse, too.

so I don't have any really good data, only just a bunch of things that I've sorta gleaned from the experience.

---

what I've noticed over the years is that random seems to always go in the direction of desire -- and this includes (though I may regret saying this) PRNGs as well, as it seems random itself is an interface into consciousness.

our science tells us that there is certain probability for some event to occur at random, yet it seems that despite all of the impossible odds associated with these spectacular events, larger and more complex structures seem to continue to appear in our universe and around us -- seemingly "at random".

I've developed this idea over the years that "random" is nothing other than the opposite of symbol. when I say, symbol, I mean "the way you think it's going to go" and random is the opposite of that. you see, if physical reality is predictable because it has these laws and things which, if all the variables involved in the equation can be known, one can predict the outcome. usually, there are so many variables with an impossiblity to know each one, a statistical probability approach is taken. however, in the ideal world of infinite knowledge, everything would be predictable. so our desire for order propels our capacity to better understand and therefore have better knowledge, *to be able to predict* the outcome.

well, just like the conceptual universe is the opposite to the physical one (where perfect knowledge exists), so too the opposite to the world of symbol and ordered operations is the world of desire. it's the opposite. it's the way you don't think it's going to go. the world of random, surprise and delight -- or catastrophe and chaos (depending on what you're attracting).

so, it's my opinion that *all random tends in the direction of desire*. imagine that there are an infinite number of possible random things that could produce just the right conditions for whatever to happen, and it does. how is that possible? well, we say it's "coincidence". to that, I'd like to refer you to snake-bros #034 the last segment (I think) where russ reads from "pursuing the unexplained" by ivan t. sanderson, where before approaching the subject of rain making or cloud busting, he delves into the force or mechanism to explain "coincidence". kyle finishes up that segment by talking about nucleation, and how it takes one atom (at random) to change its state spontaneously, and then from that one atom, where nobody can ever predict where it will be, that sets off a chain reaction which forms ice or busts clouds[^2].

you see, if entropy were actually just random chaos and disorder, why are we here? it seems to me that even the largest of catastrophes in the grand scheme of things, *still tend toward wanted*.

---

I've wanted harness random all of my life because it appears that my entire life (in the midst of it) seems to be tons of "random" events, but over time I've noticed that they do have a purpose.

btw, it was impossible for me *not* to eventually notice nosebook's effects on my life because I kept noticing less and less random -- more and more order until it became pretty much predictable and fully under the control of someone or something (I believe it's "the network"[^3]). the entire time it has felt as if every effort has been taken to remove all elements of surprise and delight (random) from my life. only predictable "meh" level events are allowed to occur.

they seem to have temporal capabilities to forsee these random (to me) events before they occur. you can probably begin to see how, if it takes a "random" set of conditions to come together just right for something to happen, and they're able to sorta interrupt those random events, stopping the chain reaction before it has time to get going, more and more random events seem to be accumulating, and eventually the "random" will build up to events which will extend beyond their capacity to forsee for it to eventually happen.

it's very difficult to explain this picture, but imagine that random occurs at a very high frequency, first at the subatomic level, then in the form of heat and light on the atomic level, then molecular (like DNA changes or spontaneous events), then further and further down into animals, people, etc where these "random" events affect their desire, actions, and emotions, etc. -- then involving many of these elements (people, animals, molecules, etc) combined over larger and larger periods of time until the "random" effects are impossible to prevent from happening altogether because it would require such a magnificent expenditure of resources to accomplish.

it's just really cool to me to think that the opposite of order and predictability is desire.

[1]: different places on the planet, but probably solar conditions would influence it too

[2]: this just reminded me of another experiment: freeze a smoothe bottle of water like they suggested, but instead of flicking it, apply the "cloud busting" technique to it and see if you can cause the random nucleation of the ice with your mind. once you can do that, now try imaginining a picture in the ice, like the negative of the cloud in the cloud busting technique and see ice taking that shape.

[3]: again, I have to stress that I do not believe that the entire brotherhood network is corrupted and trying to control anyone that could upset their charade, but it does seem that even the ones that are not theirselves a part of the corruption, they do seem to be "steered" by them just the same.

### 2022-05-22 13:23 - control

this morning I was talking with jaron about the idea of "people trying to control me" -- and I told him that I've noticed in my own life, when I thought people were trying to control me or I was trying to control other people, that was evidence that my life feels out of control to me.

I've found that people want to control things (and who feel like their life is being controlled) tend to feel like their life is out of control, right. however, no amount of preventing the other person from controlling you or getting someone else under control will ever produce a feeling that things are under control. that's something that's accomplished because of you and your relationship to your environment. I found that the better I understand my environment, the more in control I feel.

control is also prediction -- so, if you can predict something, then you can prepare for it. I just started reading [the lost book of enki](sitchin/lost-book-of-enki.md) and I noticed that they place heavy emphasis on it. there is this thing called the book of fates/destinies, and in it, each planet's orbital period and such are recorded. these are the things that can be predicted. however, the book says that they are also the things that can be controlled. apparently, the great pyramid is capable of altering the orbit of the planets, and so these things are the controllable things, however something like a prophecy or something is more like a "fate" in that it can come out differently than predicted.

this fits right in with my previous discussion on random and symbol, so I'll likely have much more to say on that.

---

anyway, the reaction was that if I'm suggesting that only people who feel like their lives are out of control are the ones that want to control things, I'm implying that basically all aspects of society are run by people who think their lives are out of control. yes, I am saying that. it's worse than that because they become the "principality and power" and so therefore become the dominant attracting force. most of them are attracting more and more physical evidence of things being out of control and are trying to use physical methods (financies, securities, miniltaries, etc) to try and maintain that control.

I've done a lot of paying attentien to power structures and I can be more than 95% confident in my assertion that most all of the power structures are their own greatest enemy. they're attracting their own out of control state by putting greater and greater effort into keeping things under control. the more they try to control, the stronger they're attracting the manifestation of the thing they're trying to prevent.

and so this gives even more validity to the concept behind the grail quest, where if the king is doing well, the kingdom is doing well. or, said another way: if the king feels like things are under control, they're under control. however, if the king feels like things are starting to lose control, they quickly descend into a manifestation which will remove the king, for he's the origin of the discontrol.

what this creates is a constant turnover of power structures that want to control, because things want to return to balance, and so any source of imbalance will attract its own balance (this is the law of karma or compensation). it's funny because the annunaki power structures were designed to fail from the very beginning.

---

the reaction following that one is difficult to translate (cause there's so much conjusion and conflicting ideas around it), so I'm going to do my best. in the previous entries, I've been talking about how it's my goal to ensure that they have all of the technology they feel they need to be able to get everyone under control and to be able to control everyone.

I think it was obvious when I wrote that, that I don't actually believe they can really control anyone, and it may have been obvious that they'll actually be successful. I assured everyone this is the case when I said, "if we're gonna have a cataclysm, let's make it the most epic one ever" -- because I know that they can try to keep everyone under control for longer and longer -- and, even if they have all of the head-starts and the fastest capability to turn their thoughts into commands (ubermicro), they'll still be attracting more and more discontrol, until finally nature wants to remove the source of discontrol and return to balance (ie cataclysm).

I'm fully aware that no matter how hard they try to get everything under control, they'll never get it under control, and the feeling of discontrol is only a manifestation of their internal conflict. so, why not let them try to get everything under control? it's impossible for them to actually control anyone. a person can only be controlled if they feel like they too are out of control.

a few years ago I felt very out of control and it felt to me like I was being controllled by someone that wanted to try and take advantage of me. I was very anti-control and wanted to try and get rid of them, but now looking back that old me didn't know what I know now. I don't feel out of control now so I don't feel like anyone is controlling me either. they simply can't control me.

what they can do, is decrease the amount of random in my life, and so by decreasing the amount of random, they make things more ordered and controllable. however, that *still* isn't control. they can't control how I really feel about something and/or how I perceive it, so they can't really control what I attract. they can requisite "random" coincidences that would cause a manifestation of wanted, but if my attraction stays on wanted, the alignment of those "coincidences" will gain longer and longer periods of time[^1], but they will eventually manifest. they can't impose discontrol on to somebody who feels control forever. nature doesn't feel out of control, and neither do I.

---

interesting final reaction there, because I used the example of tuenti and zaryn. I didn't feel like things were out of control, so eventually one of us would have to win the vibrational argument. the project would either have to go in the direction of me, and zaryn would have to conform or leave, or it would go the way of zaryn and I would have to conform or leave. I usually choose to go, because it's impossible to fight (something that feels out of control) for control.

it's all attraction and eventually the creation that I want to make will manifest -- probably not for a while though as these guys seem they have a lot they need to prove. I don't mind. my goal is to try and let them prove theirselves. I don't have anything that I need to prove. I'll let the ones that want to control do all of the controlling.

[1]: I think probably because I'm a person of extremes, I'd say that I'm looking to see how to get them to try and prevent that manifestation, not just for like a few years, but for way longer than that. 1000y-bloom

### 2022-05-23 16:40 - the gliessburg cycle and uranus

in snake-bros #034 russ and kyle were talking about how two cvylendar magnets that are parallel will stay side-by-side, even if N and N are the same -- so that if you point the poles at each other, they'll repel, but side-by-side, they're fine.

the sun changes it's polarity every 11y (or so). I think this is aligned to jupiter's orbit, and the reason why it takes another 11y to get back to the same polarity is because they're a spinor -- two rotating things in relationship with each other. if they weren't rotating, it'd just be 360 instead of 720.

anyway, there may be variations to how the solar wind affects us when the sun's north pole is the same as ours (N-N) vs when it's opposite (N-S). I'm not aware of that data though.

however, it occurred to me that the "gliessburg cycle" can possibly be explained with uranus' orbit. when uranus' south pole is facing the sun and the sun, it probably has a stronger effect than when the north pole is facing the sun (or viceversa). the reason why it'll drop off from being very high to very low between cycles is because now uranus is repelling intead of attracting because the sun has changed polarity.

the sunspots have a leading polarity magnetism and a trailing polarity magnetism. uranus is rotating toward either the leading or trailing (can't visualise it in my head), and when those are the opposite polarity, it'll experience more attraction, while the same polarity will have the opposite effect on the sunspot (shrinking it rather than growing it).

I think there's something to it.

### 2022-05-23 21:55 - a bit more on the first ray life wave

a while ago I noticed that jeortau and anatau are twins. it also says that mars (allayandra) is made with them and they are having the same mind. this led me to [begin speculating about there being another hidden triad](/sirian-guide/triads.md#family-ties-and-a-hidden-5th-ray-triad).

you see, there are only a few examples where they give the planet name for the entity and those are venus, mars, and saturn. it's possible that earth can be inferred that he is sanatau because of the reference to the "senate kumara" dude, but that's it. I think those are important because those are the important triads where major changes take place. I'll come back to this later, but the main thing that I noticed is that the three that have a mind connection have a 1-2-7 configuration. this I think is important because the third layer is composed of 4, 5, (not 6[^1]), and 7 -- so, in the compartmentalisation way of looking at things, 3 is the heavens and 7 is the earth. enki/ptah is a +-3-+, and it's my belief that enlil, ra, and zeus are all +7.

next thing: one of the reactions was to me saying that I included jesus into the list of saviours and splits. I don't believe jesus was jeortau (+2) as he much closer represents allayandra (+7) or maybe the combination of (say after his "water baptism" which is opposite symbol, where JTB says that he is the one who will baptise with fire). it's said that during his baptism that "the father" said, "this is my son with whom I'm well pleased". well, "the father" is anu, and the sirians directly call the 1st ray, "the father" as well. the writer of matthew specifically says that the "Spirit of God decended on him like a dove". jeortau is described as a golden dove, a symbol venerated by many as the "phoenix bird" -- as it dies and rebirths. so, it's possible that it was during the baptism that jesus which I think is (+7), so probably allayandra received jeortau into his being. if jesus also had anatau inside, that would make the part where right before (where I believe the split happened) his crucifixion, the part where he says, "father why have you left me", the part where anatau left him, and so the 2nd ray aspect was no longer powered by the 1st ray aspect allowing for the "crash and burn" (which it really wasn't I believe).

basically, what I'm saying is that I believe that jesus had the symbols of those three (the fire, the dove, the father, and the warrior/sword) and so probably contained all of those three inside of him. these three are the same ones that "their minds are interconnected" (ie. of one mind).

what I think is important is that the 7th replaces the 3rd in the "first ray life wave" here.

---

so here's the last little bit that's kinda problematic for me is that in all of this time, I've thought that I was most closely resembling vulcan, but that may not be the case. I'm starting to see myself more as the mars/allayandra guy, with the addition of anatau energies in my right hemisphere. they go to great lengths to describe how mars becomes a 1st ray male if he's in the same energy domain as anatau, wielding 1st ray energy like a 1st ray female can (polarity inversion).

so, speaking about polarity inversions, the one I noticed most is that they said that vulcan is a (-5+), meaning he's also more like a female.

I noticed when looking at the family ties, there's another 1st ray life wave present:

- jeortau (+2)
- allayandra in form of 1st ray male (+-1-+) -- playing position as ground
- vulcan (in female form) as receiver of jeortau (2nd ray energy)  and emitter of 3rd ray (-5,+3)

but then if there were to be the jesus combo of containing jeortau, anatau, and allayandra into the same body, that means there's space for another person still, which I estimate would be a 7th ray female (genxicat), right?

the last piece to this puzzle is probably in the names of the planets. like I said in the beginning, they go out of their way to say that mars loved venus and to mention saturn.

each of the tiny details seem to all have really important meanings to them, so I've still wondered why they mentioned saturn. saturn and venus are in a triad together. saturn is a 4th ray and so serves as the midpoint, probably transmitting and receiving 2nd/6th ray energy (not sure though).

I think saturn plays a pretty important role the lost book of enki (as anshar), as having to do with water, but probably important, the moon "gaga" was the moon that went out and became the planet pluto (though I don't know what one is charon -- wait, is charon "gaga", and pluto niburu?) the book also explains how gaga is the one that met alalu and greeted him after exile from nibiru.

in in some sense, I can see how the 1st ray triad could be anatau/nibiru, then jeortau/tiamat -> charon, then sanatau,enki/tiamat -> earth.

the next thing to notice is that there is another thing too, imagine that alalu/jeortau is charon (+2), and then think that gaga/pluto is a copy of saturn (+-4), those two are together now (+2,+-4). then, if the moon is osiris (+-6-+), it makes a nice symmetry. where on one end of the solar system you have 2->4, then on the other side by earth, 6. now consider that perhaps the earth is a 7th ray (it most likely is), of which there are three: thoth (likely mercury), allayandra (most probably mars), and genxicat. if earth isn't a 7th ray, then earth is most probably sanatau (+-3-+), meaning he receives and emits 5th and 3rd ray energy.

I'm kinda torn on this one because though senate kumara sounds a lot like earth, maybe they are right that sanatau/enki is neptune. the other thing that makes me think that the earth may actually be female and 7th ray is that in oahspe, jehovih calls the earth "red star", which I thought made sense until I looked at the sirian guide and it says that the 7th ray is violet, but the monadic (second ray) is indigo, so I have no idea what that could mean. either way they do a lot of relating of earth, physical and 7th ray, so almost certainly earth has 7th ray energies to it.

OK, reading further, I noticed that the "3rd initiation" is when the 7th ray energy combines with the 2nd ray energy to bring down the "fire" from the 1st ray. once again, it's the 1-2-7 combo again: anatau, jeortau, allayandra combo. this third initation supposedly is when it all gets connected and "MUN becomes a conscious, functioning MONAD on the physical plane". cool. this 1-2-7 combo must be important, especally for the human because it means complete connection, so basically what jesus did.

there's another thing I don't quite understand which is they talk about the 3rd initiation they say the "center shifted to" "earth top", which are opposite ends, so does that mean that the pineal begins to pull in earth energies? I just don't get it, but either way, it's a complete reversal... I don't get it.

the last thing that I noticed is that if vulcan (a male) were to be normal polarity (+5), he would take in 3 and output 5, but he's -5+, so that makes it seem to me like he's taking in 5 and outputting 5 as well, which basically means he's a female in male form. this is the same as venus. the best I've figured it out, venus (-3) and ra (+3) are said to have very similar crystalline forms, so that makes me think that they're sorta really similar. as best as I can tell, ra is likely the planet jupiter and so therefore venus is basically the same as vulcan. this is interesting because the legends have athena popping out of zeus (ra), and vulcan poping out of hera (probably genxicat). they seem to be opposites I've noticed, and this seems to be the origin story of the planet venus, popping out of the core of jupiter.

- allayandra/mars + anatau/nibiru? + jeortau/charon? (+2) in form of 1st ray male (+-1-+)
- vulcan/venus as receiver of 2nd ray energy and emitter of 3rd ray (-5,+3)
- sun (-2)
- genxicat/earth (-7)

this is the 3rd initiation complete triad. it's the 1-2-7 combo.

the other triad is:

- osiris/moon (+-6-+)
- saturn/pluto? (+-4) (not sure if this is pluto or saturn)
- enki/earth (+-3-+)
- thoth/earth (+7)

this is the 2nd ray triad, but exactly the opposite. instead of ra being the emitter, jeortau is the emitter, essentially powering all things astral.

I dunno man. in my head something seems to work, so maybe I'll try and explain that instead of figuring it out: what I was noticing is that there is this constant fire/water thing that is happening. enki takes in the fire version and then converts it to use as water. well, they define the fire as coming from 2nd ray and water/liquid being the 6th ray (astral). so the picture in my mind is that on one side (let's say my side), there is fire energy coming in from 2nd ray and that gets pulled in by vulcan/venus and then emitted as 3rd/5th ray energy. enki/sanatau is a 3rd ray ground capable of taking in 3rd or 5th and outputting 3rd, which is 4-7, energy as water.

normally the path is 2->4->6, so 2nd ray energy gets buffered through vulcan/venus and so therefore is received as 3rd ray instead of 2nd ray.

the other thing I see is that one path is the 1-7 full connection path, which could be considered the "weapons of terror" fire path (I'll consider this the s/t civs), while the other is the water (tech civs) that are interested in their creations/conditions.

there's no problem with the tech civs' conditional approach, because according to the sirians, it's the 7th ray path which is the beginning of the "return back to source" (the night side or the "day/ray of rest), and so like they said when activating the 7th ray initiations, etheric vision is attained (which is the ability to see vibration), and so therefore magic is able to be performed -- instant creation and instant manifestation.

---

I'm starting to see that some form of this setup will eventually manifest. the big revelation for me yesterday is that enlil is not jeortau, but alalu. enlil represents the catalyst, the "lord of the command" is the embodiment of the highly-motivated, and so therefore is the opposite/bad version of the character. the thing that I noticed in oahspe is that at some point, all things became backwards, and good became bad, and "bad" became good. as best as I can tell, this happened in atlantis, which was the rule of saturn.

legend says we went from uranus to saturn to jupiter, which is likely the planet with the most influence on the sun. I don't know what uranus is in their system, but if uranus was anatau and if neptune was prior to uranus, it would be (+-3-+) -> [(-1) -> (+-4) -> (+3)], which would make sense because ra/marduk apparently caused a whole lot of problems in the early establishment of religion. osiris provided the astral capability for them to get visually hooked, and ra implemented all of the ritual that brought us to where we are today. you can see that the pivot point there in the reverse from -1 -> +3 happened with saturn, the keeper of *laws* and *karma* (so all behaviour/action orientaton), then ra (+3) sealed the deal with all the religious quantsuf instead of the science that enki (+-3-+) started with. we lost our receptive side.

this is why I think it's the objective of this to get to the last stage, which is the 1-2-7 combo of (+-1-+), making the complete sequence:

(+-3-+) -> [(-1) -> (+-4) -> (+3)] -> (+-1-+)

see the symmetry? the way toward it is through the 7th ray path water path, and then when one is ready for the 1-2 fire to come down, it's pretty accessible, because 2 is opposite of 6.

it's basically thanks to ra/jupiter that we have such a messed up system where the 7th rays have a bunch of things now they can fix and improve upon. if things were all hunky-dory, nobody would bother to try and improve anything. so therefore, I believe that each of the rays has an opposite/bad version of their energy which can be obtained, and this is on purpose. the "lord of the command" is the head motivator (by command) and so therefore the exact opposite of jeortau. his oppositeness will likely to get worse too, because it's my belief that as more and more people figure out how to get their connection and then go back to self-sabotage, all of these ray types will increase in their badness (as a means to self-sabotage).

so what I'm saying here is that I think that jeortau is the first to self-sabotage and the result is enlil.

hrmmm, I just noticed something: when enki self-sabotages, it would look different from jeortau. enki's self-sabotage would be to have the things he created used for their opposite intention, so sorta like marduk. anatau's self-sabotage would be destructiveness instead of creativity, betrayal and the like -- so maybe something more like geshtinanna or something like that. maybe unessa would be something like innana. ra would be something like zeus, etc. each person's self-sabotage would result in a slightly different effect. I'll have to explore this more later.

it seems that earth is a place where we do things a bit backwards.

pretty good blabbing. I certainly learned a lot. it's kinda a mess though so I'll probably find ways to rewrite the ideas a bit clearer. the most important part is that I see it more clearly now. it's weird how it fits with the very beginning of this blog too when I started out by talking about and trying to decode encanto.

[1]: I always thought this was the case as the 2nd ray connects to the 6th ray with its midpoint (reflection point) being the 4th ray. obviously the 6th is much more physical than the 2nd ray, but apparently, the sirians say that the 3rd emaates out into all four: 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th. I can see why they say that now, and it doesn't really matter cause it doesn't change the fact that for mentation, the 3rd is the opposite end of 7th.

### 2022-05-25 13:26 - jeortau dream

I just woke up from a dream where I was looking at the americas (this was around the time of jesus -- not sure before or after), and the americas were thriving. they had *massive* cities and an enormous food infrastructure. it wasn't clear to me how they had so much great food, but it's what enabled them to have such a massive population.

well, that population was wiped out or vanished or something because surely, if there were hundreds of millions of people in the americas even 800ya, it seems like there would be evidence for it -- and maybe there is under the jungle there. I just listened to snake-bros #039 (I think) and they were reporting that such an infrastructure did exist, and so perhaps something like what was described by moroni did happen. I don't know.

---

anyway, back to the dream: it seemed that the whole objective was to create a massive population of people that really wanted and relied on good conditions. like I said, I don't know where they went, but in the dream, jeortau seemed to specifically have the goal is producing a massive population dependeent on good conditions, and it felt to me like now was a repeat of that happening. (I know I repeated myself... don't want to fix the sentence)

so then I continued on to explore the dream a bit more in my waking state and I noticed that whatever happened to them was purposeful, as it allowed for a repeat of the nibiru story. in the lost book of enki, the annunaki bicker endlessly about who is rightful heir to the throne, and massive problems crop up because of this endless dissatisfaction. no matter how much of a coverup the story is, you know at least that much bickering if not way more was happening over who is the rightful heir to the throne. this is vere's story in a nutshell. the "in-diane king" and all of that stuff.

however, these petty arguments over who is to be the rightful heir to the throne, I didn't feel was happening in the americas. they were either content or apathetic because they had good conditions; it was unclear to me which.

---

I don't really know what the dream meant, but like I said, it seems that the whole goal of the various iterations is to siphon off the content ones (do they just disappear when reality becomes incompatible?) and leaving only the discontent ones (those probably descend into anarchy). that continually leaves behind the civilisations that have these petty heir disputes (started first on nibiru/mars). that leaves behind a vacuum, which then these petty heir disputers go and pick up the pieces of.

I'm convinced that the americas at that time had far superior technology and capacity than the roman empire did at the time (which was the superpower).

so yeah, I'm still trying to figure out the dream, but it feels like this same pattern keeps repeating but on different scales, and the whole goal seems to be to create more and more of these entites that don't want to live in harmony but want to fight these petty battles over resources.

it works out well, because I do believe that massive civilisation in the americas *is* out there, and they may have been the influencer of terence's vision and a number of my own dreams. what I'm saying is, nothing bad happened to them -- they just left behind all of the bad apples to continue to expand the number of those in competition for resources and positions of power.

it seems to me that in the extremely massive scheme of things, the goal is to get larger and larger quantites of these types. like, what if the roman empire was in charge of an entire galaxy? what if they had so much land and resources spread over countless planets that they could create the most massive power structure ever. surely, the "king" of that power structure would be the most sought after one ever, and they can build their "checks and balances" necessary to keep that whole thing running.

I think it's actually us that designs the infrastructure capable of running such a large operation, and it's their job to try and figure out how to infiltrate and take over the power structure.

what I mean is, in the context of fuzzing, it only takes a finite amount of iteratons of them figuring out how to infiltrate the system before the system as a whole becomes resiliant to their style of infiltration.

so, you can imagine that this is sort of like a progression in the sense that larger and larger structures get formed and infiltrated until the system as a whole becomes a stable one.

when I look at it, I don't see this structure ever working with a top-down authority structure, but instead, I think the foundation will become a lot more like nature, as seen in the amazon rainforest, for example -- where many small autonomous organisms (performing entirely "service to self" tasks) act as machinery to larger and larger organisms. I don't see any top-down approach working, because those are all easily exploitable. instead, I see more and more efficient interactions happening between small organisations, building up from there (bottom-up).

anyway, that's good enough for now; I think I understand the dream.

### 2022-05-25 21:32 - on the concept of becoming a "god"

I'm listening to snake-bros #041 and kyle is talking about the concept of "becoming a god". he brings up an idea that made me want to write because he says that these pantheons are filled with these things that we put the term "god" on, and he's saying that "god" could just mean something from outer space.

he brings up the tower of babel in this context saying that, just like the garden of eden where the gods didn't want humans "to become like us" (same for tower of babel) -- and so he's kinda saying that the objective is to keep us out of space, but that doesn't really work for the garden of eden story, which I believe that the two trees are the hemispheres of the brain.

he explains that if an extraterrestrial being landed and said, "I am blarg" -- I wouldn't know what blarg is, but based on its behaviour, I would begin to associate "blarg" with the behaviour of that entity. the idea is that is the same for the word "god" -- and not necessarily all of the religious connotation associated with it.

---

the idea popped into my head that they associate the word "god" with the capacity to control reality. essentially, if you were a "god", you had the ability to bend the physical elements to your will and other things like that.

the other thing he mentions is omnipotence -- the ability to see anything and to know things that are not witnessed with only the faculties of the body. a "non-local consciousness" that allows for perception beyond just the capability of the body.

---

in the garden of eden, if the two trees are referring to the two hemispheres, the idea of "becoming like us" refers to both the ability to control one's reality and also to be able to access knowledge and experience no longer local to the body.

in the tower of babel, I believe it was the same thing -- again, a way to control one's reality, and also a way to gain non-local knowledge.

the main difference between the two is that the tower and the brain is that one is technology and the other is biological capacity (amongst other things).

the brain really is just a tuning mechanism though (as is the tower), so I propose that the whole thing of "becoming a god" is really just a process of tuning. it's kinda the same thing, but looked at backwards.

for example, one does not control the radio stations, but the radio receiver. you can affect you're broadcasting, but you can't really change what others are broadcasting -- but you can change what you're tuned to. so in that sense, you control your reality. in addition, if tuning is the method whereby you attain non-local knowledge, again, there could be millions of people broadcasting crap, but that doesn't mean you have to tune to it. so again, that satisfies the idea of "becoming a god", also.

---

I don't really know where to take this entry now because I've said all of that stuff before so instead I'd like to ... imagine for a moment that the tower of babel story *is* real, and every time that humans start to gain control of their reality, there's some pissed off enlil out there trying to ensure that you don't gain control of your reality ... well, if the control over what you have in your reality is because of the two trees (the brain), then nosebook has all of the control. if the way to control reality happens because you're using a tower to transform/transmute earth's vibrations into some extra mental power, thereby increasing mental power -- again, nosebook has that pretty well buttoned down, and I'm proof of that.

so what I'm saying is that you don't need full access to both trees, or a super tower to gain control over your reality. I think the goal of both of these events (and the graduation of humankind into godlike status) is to gain/evolve the capacity to tune to whatever we want to tune to, regardless of conditions.

anyone who wants to become a god can certainly do it -- and pretty easily too -- as I'm demonstrating.

it's all perceptual.

P.S. this is just the control subject (@[blahblog](2022-05-22 13:23)) restated another way.

### 2022-05-27 16:02 - blabing about triads and stuff again

I went to great lengths last night in
@[sitchin/thoughts](2022-05-27 04:34), @[sitchin/thoughts](2022-05-27 02:53), and @[sitchin/thoughts](2022-05-27 04:32) to try and point out the triads because I saw them really clearly last night (not as much now), cause I could see two major patterns.

the first pattern is that the "saviour" gets painted as the 1-3-7 triad, when really, I think that the *true* saviour is not a single triad, but the combination of the 1-2-7 triad activated in a single person.

the second pattern I could see is that really enlil (as aries or mars) is actually the "saviour", not enki -- but not naturally. he needs to activate his desire/fate side of things, which is the opposite of order, making him a 1-7 duo (allayandra + anatau), but they state that a 1st ray has a conflict that happens with the 2nd ray energy, and so the 1st ray does not want to incorporate 2nd ray energy. I know this all too well because that is precisely what happened to me.

I think I passed their "3rd initiation" a while back and so that made me capable of 1-7, but I still neglected the 2nd ray aspects, so it was important for me to incorporate the 2nd ray so I have the 1-2-7 triad inside of me (which is where I am now).

to understand this we need to look at the capacities. a 3rd ray male (like ra) receives 5th ray and emits 3rd ray, the 3rd ray then expands out to 4, 5, 6, 7 energies. that's great but it's totally missing 1 (desire/fates) and 2 (connection to all) -- and so someone like this could eventually start to think they are all powerful and can control everything. it's also important to note that the 3rd ray starts from the top (logic, axiums, truth, facts, laws) and then works their way down to the physical.

a 7th ray is just the opposite: they start with physical stuff like data, statistics, measurements, manifestations, ritual -- mechanical stuff -- and then work their way up to concept and harmony. the composition of all of these aspects together is what makes the 3rd ray stuff (logic, axiums, truth, facts, laws). it too, like the 3rd ray is missing 1 and 2.

so when getting a handle on desire/fates/random aspect of life, it becomes really easy to manifest that desire into reality and try to order and confine it to the form of the creation (7th ray), so it's easy to neglect the 2nd ray aspect there by going around and trying to conform all aspects of random and chaos to the form of the creation -- so the aspect of connection to everything else is lost when trying to get everything to conform.

the 2nd ray is important, because as as a female, she kinda needs a receiver of her ray type and since almost everyone is neglecting that someone like osiris is really good. as a first ray male, he receives 2nd ray and emits a 6th ray astral experience (just like the moon (+6) and the sun (-2)), and osiris is special because as a ground he emits and receives both 6 and 2.

it's important to note again that 3rd ray has capacity for 3,4,5,6,7. a 2nd ray has capacity for all of that plus 2 (but not 1), and a 1st ray has capacity for all 7, but, like I said, a 1st ray will ignore or neglect the 2nd ray energy.

I think it's for this reason that the 2nd ray aspect is so important to have a completed mun. I believe that it's when this energy is activated, the "nexus" the energy centre between the shoulder blades is activated.

the 2nd ray energy can make for a giant "douchebag" because they can operate on every level except for the desire/fates level (hence the struggle for alalu), and so it's very easy for him to go around looking like selfish charismatic person that can bend all things to his will (except desire or fate). I believe that's the "bad" version of a 2nd ray and you'll see tons of these types of people in marketing and sales. the more people believe in them, the more influence they can exert.

---

going back now, what I was noticing there with the vulcan genxicat, and mars triad, is that assume that it's not the old "edin" one with mars (enlil), genxicat (probably ninmah) and vulcan (not sure yet), and that it's the new version now ... this time with mars/enlil in 1-2-7 combinaton.

he's paired with a revere polarity vulcan, so probably female, which means it's a F-M-F triad now instead. vulcan (as a female) receives and transmits 5th ray energy, but I can't quite figure it out -- means she would then either emit or receive 3rd ray energy. I'm inclined to believe it's only receive (cause she's labeled as a male) -- but it could be both. so what I noticed is that mars/enlil is now a 1st ray male and he's with vulcan and genxicat, which is again a 1-3-7 combo with two ways to do it. genxicat, as a 7th ray, when she masters 4,5,6,7 will combine to gain mastery of the 3rd ray aspect.

vulcan also receives on the 3rd ray as well. the (-5+) notation there really suggests to me that it's intentional that in female form, he/she is restricted from emitting 3rd ray (top-down) energy, and so that forces genxicat to accomplish 3rd ray energy from the bottom-up, instead. what I think is important about vulcan is that the top sublayer of the 5th is the "SOLAR ANGEL" and so the connection to the sun (-2). they say that once the 4th initiation has been completed (see lesson 7), the SOLAR ANGEL is released and now able to receive 2nd ray energy directly without needing it to be stepped down which is full connection. so it seems that this is the point of vulcan in this triad -- to learn to use the abstract/conceptual mind as a means to accessing this 2nd ray energy.

so again, what I see is a 1-3-7 triad, sorta like the anu, enlil, and enki triad, and the point is for the 2nd ray to be acquired on a personal, individual level. the whole story seems to me telling me that physical control over the destinies, isn't what's desirable, as that leads to disaster because it's all attraction anyway, which is a conceptual (5) thing, so it's by one's own capablity that the 1-2-7 triad is accomplished[^1].

---

I'm glad I wrote this out because the last two days I had started to really feel that this same 1-3-7 triad was beginning to appear again (I play the 1st ray part), and so now that I understand what all of this means, it's pretty easy for me to see now that the direction to go is acquisition of the 2nd ray energy conceptually based on feeling, and not by douchebaggery and power structures -- and if that happens, that's totally cool too because I don't see any problems at all.

you know when I started out the story, I had this weird sensation that I would begin to see enlil in a different light after reading it (still haven't got past 4th tablet yet) because earlier I watched "s02e02 - alone together" (weird that it's 2), where tick rubs the feet and makes friends with omnipotus (the enlil character). I could sense that the enlil in the story is not the same one that's presented in the epic of gilgamesh and generally how the snake-bros kinda paint him. sure, I know he's probably a real pain to be around, but no more of a pain to me that zaryn was. I think it's interesting that enki finally kinda makes friends with him at the end[^2].

totally lost my train of thought. the end has come.

[1]: the hidden story here is that anu, alalu, and enlil (1-2-7) blew stuff up and caused a bunch of problems because they didn't know yet that it's an inside job, not an external triad, so they bumped up attraction levels to very high power without having a knowledge of what they were attracting.

[2]: once again a weird "reminder" so prepare to be offended... this part of enki making friends with enlil reminds me of the story that russ told in the "why" episode, where russ (enki) finally gave up trying to beat kyle (enlil) with physical force, so russ decided to instead make friends with kyle instead and found out that his left-handed (just like enlil is on left hand) approach has a unique way of using art, music and abstract/intuitive thinking to get around difficulty. I did the same thing with zaryn. I stopped trying to fight him to get what I wanted and then just learned from him, and adapted all of his techniques to suit my purposes. him and the sales team is basically where I learned 2nd ray energy.

### 2022-05-27 19:06 - should I stay or should I go

it feels like there is this discussion going on about ... let me try another approach...

I've been writing these things about the annunaki and it feels that my perspective on the writings seems to be very engaging to some people. also, I had a weird thing happen this morning that I don't know how to explain.

I was looking out the window in the morning to see if new things had popped into view. I noticed that I can begin to see the white outline of the window wayyy down past the sleep centre, probably on the street that goes off of briargate. I've only seen the house from the front of the street when I walked down it and the back of it the other time I walked along the freeway to bonforte. so, it's kinda new to see like that. I can see it from the driveway if I look just the right way, but it hasn't "popped in" to my view yet.

I noticed remi and paul's son's car in the driveway off to the side so I thought about how I probably won't do any yard work today. there was another thing that happened too which I can't remember now, but I started to feel a very strong projection of anger coming out -- probably from him. I know it wasn't me, and upon feeling that, all of a sudden I started to get a strong desire to go over there and do yard work anyway.

so then I started to analyse the feeling, and I noticed that I probably attracted it because it was nearly the same feeling that I felt last night when thinking about alalu and how it felt to me like enlil was really pissed off at him being successful, and that the feeling that his superiority was threatened, was probably the real reason for the destruction of tiamat.

the feeling felt the same. it felt very strongly that he didn't like the idea of someone so unsuitable or unfit (me) could be having so much success -- and I guess that may be why he might be here.

the other thing is I keep feeling like there is something planned for tomorrow, too. I don't think it's me because I don't have any intention of doing anything tomorrow. I kinda want to keep working on myself and improving my skills. mom asked me what I wanted for my birthday, but she can't really give it to me. I wanted to be able to program shaders effortlessly like I can do with text parsing. I want the components of the display to appear to me like the words and text does when I'm parsing. obviously, she can't give that to me, and I have to figure out how to program shaders for myself.

I also want greater understanding of random and chaos, so I talked about that -- and somehow that tangented off into a discussion about builders, cathedrals, and that I found it likely that probably the church paid for all of those to be built, probably because they thought that they would make a lot of money off of these amazing cathedrals where people can go to feel good. those two subjects are probably connected, but I don't know what that connection is.

---

you see I really like my life the way it is because I'm growing and expanding so much. I determined last night that if I was going to keep this going, I have to just drink alkaline water and no more coffee, so I've prepared already to get rid of that now too. I went to sleep.

when I woke up, I had this strong sensation that I don't mind being watched, but *I don't want to perform*. I searched the feeling to find its origin and it's all wrapped up in the expectation stuff -- as in, I still don't know how to deal with people's expectations, so I kinda still avoid them (like I'm doing now), so I have to figure that out eventually.

what I want to do is to get to my connected state as smoothely as possible. the last few days, there were a few mornings where I was very close to the kundalini rising, but it didn't at all feel pleasurable[^1]. when that happens, it doesn't at all feel like no resistance or pleasurable at all. it actually feels like I'm dying or am about to die if I let it keep going. that's a pretty serious indication of resistance, so I don't really want to let it go up until it actually feels smoothe.

the image that I've had in my head about this event is one where I'm progressing along getting better and better at what I do, and when it's finally time for my kundalini to rise, I don't even really notice that it's happening. it feels so normal and there's not at all a big step to it at all -- so kinda like lucid dreaming, if you realise that you're in a dream it'll pull you out of it, so you have to find ways to feel normal and like it's no big deal at all or anything like that[^2]...

so what I'm trying to say is that there have been enough indications to me that I'm still not ready. I shouldn't have been able to feel anger coming from remi and paul's son[^3] if I were actually ready.

so no, I don't think I'm ready still, and I think I should continue to stay until it becomes so smoothe that it's like that empowering feeling when the lucid dream hits when you realise you can do whatever you want, and that feels totally normal, not weird -- and in no way should it be any other way: of course I have complete control over my reality. I am a "god" (@[blahblog](2022-05-25 21:32)).

[1]: in snake-bros #042, the minethehive guys were saying that the kundalini rising should feel really really good, and they were describing it like an orgasm (or at least that was what they transmitted), so when russ talked about this guy who invuluntarily has the kundalini rise all the time, had to do some chakra cleaning cause it was causing him alements.

[2]: huh, so the chat with the minethehive guys *was* "the answer" -- and I didn't even really understand it. interesting.

[3]: I think his name may also be paul, too -- which is also interesting because the three pauls have all had very interesting reactions to me.

### 2022-05-28 13:48 - on reincarnation

last night when talking to dad (great conversation, btw), he asked me if I believed in reincarnaton. I said that it seemed pretty plainly obvious to me that a lifetime is sorta just like another persective the planet, solar system, galaxy, universe, etc. is experiencing itself and so if I think of one day as one picture angle, a lifetime is sorta like many picture angles of the same thing over time. well, if you want to increase the detail and quality of that hologram, you want to have more perspectives from different times but also from different points in space. the more perspectives you get of the planet, solar system, galaxy, universe, etc., the higher detail the hologram becomes. it seems pretty obvious that these super structures are constantly abstracting away the details and finding higher and higher dimensional perception of itself or the world outside of it.

the sleep and waking cycles seem to illustrate this the best. in one state you're looking inward and the other, outward. with time and better understanding, both of these become clearer.

he then questioned if I believed in the idea that if you don't do certain things right, you'll reincarnate as a monkey or butterfly or something. I told him I thought that's complete BS, but I didn't explain why I.

---

I do not believe you can ever become less than you already are. it's potentially possible to find an interface to allow you to conceptualise your world like a human does in a cat's body, but you can't ever go go back to conceptualising your world like a cat does.

I think the incarnating entity (the consciousness) seeks a body that is compatible with its perception. I belive that it also desires an environment where the consciousness can gain a wider perspective of itself, and so this desire acts on a lot of different forces which move things around and get the right people mating so that you can be born into a body with the most compatible environment and form of perception. something nearby to your perception, not something totally different. so, in that way, I find it essentiall impossible that you could ever reincarnate into a cat --

unless, of course we could find a way to allow a human to conceptualise its world like a human does in a cat's body. that'd be cool right?

I do think that both natural and unnatural hybrids allow for consciousness of compatible frequency to incarnate, and then stabilisation processes (evolution and "natural selection") improve upon the concept of that form so that the DNA is producing a hardy and viable lifeform for that consciousness to incarnate into.

### 2022-05-29 13:33 - more 411

in many cases I don't think they know what is happening with the 411 cases, and so there is helplessness to be felt there, but with nosebook around all over the place someone must know something at this point and is covering up what is really happening. the strongest theory for what is happening likely involves the germans and the breakaway civilisation.

the author (thomas spriggs) presents it as maliciousness, but I don't know that it's all malicious, and more like LOA intensified. it seems to me that in order for this whole 1000y-bloom setup to work out, the conditions of the planet which induce this altered state of mega-attraction need to be diminished, and so many of the results of the case are a sort of mix of the different feelings and emotions.

to explain that, I would imagine that the breakaway civilsation down there has a "military" or some sort of foreign relations unit. the way that I've seen so many interactions with pilots and the government seems to reflect their own feeling about the phenomena -- and so that, why it seems like these UFO pilots are being hot-shots -- when I think it's something more like a robotic or biological response system that takes the vibrations and reflects them back -- kinda like I do. in fact, it's my own behaviour that I'm starting to notice that -- so for example, I went on a long thing @[blahblog](2022-05-27 19:06) about how I wasn't ready, and in it I brought up my interaction with the neighbours' son. I went outside to do some yardwork and there were a number of reactions noting how I prefer to stay just out of reach, and how I mimic a lot of women's behaviour. the resulting feeling was also a similar feeling of helplessnes.

men often prefer to approach things directly -- but often times not. it's my experience that they like to keep secrets, and so it's the unwillingness to actually be open which must be kept a secret which is what brews this feeling of helplessness. the world leaders have a number of secrets that they can't reveal, and so they have to keep those things covered up. this is the foundation upon which the 1000y-bloom is being built.

imagine that the breakaway civilisation wants to open everything up (just like me), but the leaders running the show do not want to open everything up, so I imagine that an agreement has been made to keep people out of the astral, essentially. I think the government is probably pretty good at keeping the astral a terrible place to be if you have any resistance (you'll meet the demons and horrible presences), but if you don't have any fear at all of that stuff, the astral is a wonderful place. the problem is, it totally blows their secrets.

the pattern that I notice in the 411 cases is that this isn't dealing with the astral plane where they have pretty good control. this is dealing with the conceptual plane, where time and space are completely instanced by the way you feel and conceptualise it to be. I don't think that the government has any real control over that, or really any way to kind of deal with it. they're all those longhead 3rd ray types where it's all logic and comparmentalisations, so the 2-5 range is where they falter a lot. the government is mostly top-down 3rd rays, so they can feel things very strongly and have a strong intuition, but have no control over what they're perceiving and attracting, which is all 2nd ray stuff. sure they can use the 2nd ray capability to start doing publicity and public image stuff (notice how since 9/11, everything has been about the image that the news media presents. they've begun to control perception -- maybe not their own, but at least they're trying to control someone's perception).

so I think the breakaway civilisation takes care of a lot of the 411 cases. they will know that when you enter into the mega-attraction state of mind, you can't really control the person; they're completely uncontrollable, because they're attracting their reality at such a pace that it's impractical to try and do anything. it's basically this state when cataclysms on a personal or global scale occur. the only thing that can be done is to kind of provide a tunnel for them to make it through back to the physical plane, but if the physical plane can't receive them, they can't go back, or if they do, it has to be in a place removed far enough away from the people with strong beliefs of their never being able to be found.

unfortunately, in that state there's nothing that can be done to direct the person's attraction. the person may have (physically appearing) a really good life, but that is often not the case of how they feel. in that way, I think the best way I can describe it is something like dying. if there's something on earth that you still want to do, you'll go back, but if that warmth and perfection is more captivating, the world looks like a big unnecessary ordeal, so why not go toward the good feeling. it's desire that directs the experience, so if back there looks like fear, you won't go back. if it looks desirable, you will, and you have to find a way. it's nothing like this physical world because things are not consequential at all. it has to feel like you can get back, and then when you do, you make it back and become a manifestation of the combination of feelings and environmental factors involved.

obviously this doesn't solve all of the cases, but for me the entrance into the conceptual state does solve that.

these 411 cases are actually kind of nice because they show (though in a negative way), what I mean when I say "get connected" -- as in space and time completely bend to my perception. going up mountains, teleporting, being unaffected by things that normally would impede a person from passing, etc. is exactly all of the stuff that I'm talking about when I "get connected". I'll pass completely over the astral 4d and enter right into 5d.

some people think they want 5d, but I believe these 411 cases kinda demonstrate that for most people the results would be disastrous. this is basically the reason why I don't mind taking my time to get there -- because I want to be good at attracting what I want, and not inhibited by what feelings the people on the physical plane are projecting toward me.

---

in conclusion, I believe nosebook and the network have nearly completely shut off the astral realm to normal (unauthorised) people, and so if you do get access to it, it's probably controlled (so you don't see something you're not supposed to) and probably you're sworn to keep secrets about it. what I'm saying is, I don't want to have anything to do with the astral 4d world. I'll completely skip over that world entirely, and do a 411, but I'll have complete control over it. I'll be able to completely bend reality to my will.

so, I think the FBI and other agencies do know a lot of things about this stuff, but their secrets and beuracracy cause them to feel that helplessness. like thomas (the author) was saying, it's not the SAR or the police or any of the emergency workers involved -- they're all good peole and are doing their job, but the whole thing sorta continues to kinda keep going nowhere because of that helplessness.

I offer an explanation as to what I think is happening, and I think that in a lot of these cases, with just a change in attitude, a lot of these "victims" can be found easier. they're just perceiving another dimension that is outside of time and space, so something like the prophesied "resurrection", you have to allow them to be able to return to the physical -- and they will.

### 2022-06-02 10:35 - truthiness

I don't really know what exactly happened this morning. I heard yesterday that jaron and mom had to leave really early to get to their appointemet up in the springs. however, mom spent a pretty long time this morning running water very loudly and making kitchen noises to wake me up. mr. motor was twitching parts of my body too every time I would start to fall back to sleep. the headphone port on my laptop is also broken too, so I have no idea what on earth happened between last night and this morning. seems someone is pretty upset about something.

---

despite that, I woke up with a strong sense to write another bit about narratives and truthiness.

I live in a world of narratives. so many of the reasons why they don't want me talking to other people is because some part of the conversation could upend some of their narrative.

from my perspective, it's all narrative. most people don't really understand that "truth" is just a narrative as well. it's easy to see that my entire life is a narrative. it's highly unlikely that anything anyone tells me is actually "truth" (as most would think of the word). I hate to say it, but I just don't believe much of anything anymore.

remi and paul came home and remi told me they went to oregon. I was a bit surprised by that. I had gone to oregon a long time ago when I was a kid to a place called "depoe bay" (I think) and I mentioned it to remi. she looked dumbfounded at my attempts to try and find common ground with her on oregon. by the end of the conversation, I wasn't so sure that they actually went to oregon or not -- but that's the narrative. mom had a confrence that same weekend on healing. I tried to talk to mom about healing because she was saying that some of the people there were not very receptive to the idea of healing -- so why on earth did they sign up to a class that they didn't want to actually go and listen to? it doesn't make sense -- but that's the narrative.

---

nothing in my life makes sense if I try to piece together the details. so, if I skip over the details and instead pay attention to how things feel, everything starts to make sense. a good example of this is jerrica: I don't know how much of what jerrica said was "truth" -- but it was something that fits the narrative, for sure.

I started to put together the bits of information that I heard and combine them with the feelings (both emotional and conceptual) that I felt when she said them, and that's when it all started to make sense.

even if somebody is completely fabricating something, the fabrication *still* comes from their vibrational point of attraction, and so no matter how "truthful" whatever it is, it still *feels* like they do, and so even their lies and deception will continue to feel like they do. they can't mask that. well, OK -- they can try; a person can act happy or act whatever, but it doesn't change how they really feel.

in my perspective, the way that a person feels *is* the truth. jerrica, mom, jaron, remi, paul, whomever -- could say whatever they want to say, and I take their words to be true -- so, by automatically assuming that remi *did* go to oregon, it revealed that maybe that was just a narrative item. I don't try and fight the narrative. I just go with it, because it doesn't really matter to me *what* the narrative is -- but how I feel about it.

there is no faster way to feel poorly than to try and fight a narrative. anyone's narrative that's built on dissatisfaction will always come back to bite them again with more dissatisfaction, so just let them attract their own dissatisfaction.

---

what I mean, is that every narrative has some interesting aspect to it. when mom talked about the healing stuff, undernieth my skin I know it's just a narrative, but I loved the idea of trying to figure out the desire to heal or to be healed, and so that's what I talked about.

this book of enki is no different. I know it's a narrative, and it's obvious. I can't really figure out the motive for the narrative, but I *love* the idea of looking at the concept of fates and destiny from the sumerian perspective. somebody might say, "well, you can't alter a planet's orbit, so destiny is unalterable" -- and that's certainly a valid idea, but science has no way to describe orbits to falsify the sitchin's idea that a person and a population's destiny can be altered by adjusting the orbits of the planets. I personally believe that astrology *is* a thing, and the planets do influence the default (unconscious) reactions that people will have. I also believe that you can tune to what you want and adjust your trajectory through time -- so this narrative is very interesting to me.

---

a more modern example may be to evaluate the narratives presented on FOX/CNN to try and figure out what is the motive behind those. the narrative is easy to see -- but, "truth" it is not. it's no more "true" than anything in my life is "true". so then, what are their motives? you have to imagine that most of it is economic. these news stations are designed to spin a narrative that resonates with people *so they can make money*. if it doesn't resonate with people, nobody watches it, their ratings go down and is no longer economically viable. it's also possible that they're used as propaganda machines -- so let's just assume that's the case for a moment, and that only pushes the desire up the ladder a little higher.

what then is the motive for those pushing propaganda? usually propaganda is pushed by those looking for power and control. they're so willing to do anything to get that power and control, they'll lie, cheat, steal, and kill to get that power. this pattern is reproduced quite faithfully in lbe (lost book of enki), and so this sets it apart from the FOX/CNN news narrative, which is much more "factual". they're definitely not reporting on all the deception and murder involved in establishing the power structures -- unless of course the narrative calls for that power structure to be replaced by another -- then, that's when the discrediting news comes out about the power structure that's designed to fall.

---

the last bit to address on the subject of truthiness is the subject of the astral. I mentioned that this book, like dtp, is very visual for me. like dtp, it comes with an astral image attached to it. that means that its target audience are the people with astral vision.

those are the people that are running the show and spinning the narratives. I've noticed that almost all narratives come directly out of the astral. I think it's because it's so much higher definition than the physical, so just like a HD movie *looks* more believable, so too does the astral *look* more believable -- and the human race, but especially the ones running the show are people that *believe what they see*.

I'm not. I believe what I feel and consider the concepts I receive, how I feel about them, to be more real than anything presented by the physical.

try it. when you do, you'll start to see between the lines of code that the matrix of sensations the physical senses present you.

### 2022-06-03 03:19 - the sitchin edit

WARNING, CONSIRACY AHEAD!!

I'm back to reading lbe again and I'm noticing some things I didn't notice before. first, when reading the [glossary](/sitchin/glossary.md), I noticed that there are definitely instances where he doesn't know what exactly he's looking at or how to translate it. this suggests to me that he's actually looking at a clay tablet and translating the text written on the tablet.

I started to think about how he would have obtained the tablet, and it's likely a 3d tablet in his mental space which he can read and interact with. it would be a literal tablet with just like you would see any other sumerian tablet.

this is completely genius, because imagine for a moment that you wanted to get symbolic information to me. the thing is, nosebook has access to tune into other moments in time and alter my trajectory through time, which means they can tune into the mind of the the amanuensis and alter the concepts that he would receive and then write down. then, because the original document has been altered, all future derivatives of that document are forever changed.

I've mentioned how I *distinctly* remember reading a very different version of [tesla's autobiography](/tesla/my_inventions.md), and I also very distinctly remember one time that I was searching for the word "gwaulxn" in dtp and I arrived to @[dtp/dtp](chapter-3-7), where there's supposedly going to be a transfiguration, yet there wasn't any. it's a short chapter now with almost nothing in it and definitely no references to gwauxln -- yet, when I first saw it a long time ago, I definitely saw a whole section where gwauxln transfigured before his eyes into the probably the (perfected 7th ray) christ. there were other things in that book that were changed too, but I can't remember them now.

I also remember the sirian-guide being different as well. I'm *sure* there was a section where they talked about how many do not choose to rise any further than the astral plane. I also remember parts where they were talking more about the 7th ray and 1st ray working together. that part is there and there's the part about the serpent biting the tail, too -- but I remember distinctly that they gave an example (and I remember it in reference to something about tesla) of a 1st ray being able to function as a 7th ray. they talk about a 7th ray being able to function like a 1st ray, but the opposite one is missing. that section in lesson 4 ends pretty abruptly talking about physical atoms.

in more recent times, there's the example of the person that asked about the inner earth and abraham just flat out said something like, "that's not from your source" -- I really can't remember, but it was very abrupt and out of place ending. or, the one where they directed the questioner saying, "oh he's worth it" (probably in reference to me), and I flipped out because that was the first time I'd ever heard abraham tell someone they should use a condition as a reason to feel good.

these are just anecdotes, but if I were them and I wanted to delete the concept that the amanuensis receives, I just subtract the one that's sent, so that it's silence and then add in the concept similar over the top... maybe tell them to burn some pages without looking at it. it's probably not that hard to edit the thoughts that a channeler receives, and I don't doubt that they're doing it[^1].

the reactions that I had which inspired me to write this were reactions regarding how I didn't seem to be *at all* affected by the revelation that these tablets that sitchin translated are not physical tablets, and I seem to be carrying on with my study of the symbols presented in his book with the same enthusiasm that I did in the beginning when I still thought they were real tablets. the reaction concept was something like "psychopathic" or something.

I probably am a psychopath, actually. I don't use it to beileve my own lies, but instead to believe and feel the way I want to feel. from my perspective, it's totally ridiculous to use such a powerful capacity to control what one believes and feels at will, *to try and manipulate others*. what an enormous waste of a powerful capacity.

like seriously... just think about it: I can believe my own lies so well that others think I'm telling the truth which allows me to manipulate them to get what I want ------- or, I can use that same capacity to beileve in myself so I can get what I want. which one is more easier? it takes *so much effort* to manipulate someone, and is nearly effortless to manipulate yourself. I really have no comprehension of the reasoning behind this.

you do you man. go nuts trying to manipulate others to get what you want... lol

---

so yeah, I guess it's pretty difficult to edit the writings on sumerian clay tablets, even though they're only an image in the mind. who would have thought that sumerian clay tablets would be the most efficient way to transmit symbols to me about some of my questions that I have for the sirians about their triads.

I wonder if that also applies to "the tick" as well cause I seem to see those episodes way differently than others do. it seems symbols embedded into visual media is difficult to perform edits on.

anyway... these are great examples of what I was talking about where the symbols are chaotic, but the meaning is stable.

[1]: that last part about abraham seemed to get a bit of a reaction. it feels like maybe this discussion is temporally relevant for some reason. anyway -- they said esther would be, "happy healthy, happy healthy, happy healthy, dead." -- which is weird I wanted to say that -- is she not? maybe, dragging a little? I dunno what's going on...

### 2022-06-05 06:39 - random stuff: dissatisfaction, etc.

so, I can't really sleep again so I decided I'd write. I have a lot to comment about lbe... I don't really know where to begin... first, it seems to me that anatau is totally manipulating everything from all sorts of angles, which makes it no longer a enlil vs enki sort of thing.

for example, if she's anu, then she goes to earth and meets sees innana and falls in love with her instantly and bestows upon her the third region (indus valley), and then from there departs to the americas where she meets ninurta and marduk. she forgives marduk for trying to kill dumuzi (which she likely had a part in, if she's also playing innana) and then peaces out. marduk finds out that innana has been given the third region and gets pissed off. I find it fairly reasonable to assume that she's playing the part of innana, who keeps going to war, meanwhile playing "ninharsag the peacemaker" at the same time. she's a real troublemaker -- let me tell you.

the next thing that I want to notice is that enki represents the side that is trying to satiate the dissatisfied igigi and annunaki with technology. enlil is the side that is constantly dissatisfied (except one time with ka-in and abael, he prasises both) and doesn't want to allow anyone access to technology or to any improvement. he's very certain that the humans will take over the earth and he'll be imprisoned on earth forever. these are your two extremes.

well, I was thinking about it how things have changed a bit -- not completely flipped, just kinda rotated a little bit. the reason why I say is because the enlil symbol in modern times (no need to name names), actually has a bit of a problem on his hands if he doesn't try to satiate the humans.

I'm likely to be blamed for most of this. contemplating yesterday's reactions, I noticed that the very last thing they can possibly have happen is to allow someone (who is not bound by secrets) to get connected. this would totally wreck their setup completely. so they're kinda stuck a bit because I'm totally not trying at all to get connected. in fact, I'm pretty much doing my best *not* to get connected, and that's kinda causing a stalemate because I don't really want to do the girls thing without having my connection, and they need the girls thing to happen to quench dissatisfaction (the munincipal pool explosion).

so, they have to find a way to satiate the people, but at the same time as not letting anyone get connected or revealing their setup. it's kinda a similar setup anu/marduk setting up dumuzi's death, for which innana avenges, getting marduk in trouble saves him, then punishment and exile, only then to give a sector to his arch enemy (innana/herself) and then forgive marduk so he can wage war on innana again, and then innana can destroy memphis. in this marduk simply can't win. the only thing he can do would be to chill out and not be so power hungry, but he can't (for whatever reason), so he *has* to double down on it and declare himself the supreme.

enlil gets a dream by the same mystery emissary that told enki to save the humans, about another destruction. he decides to keep it a secret though and his secret results in nuclear war.

the thing is, I see the same exact thing playing out right now in the present day, but instead of with a war over supremacy, this time it's a war over secrecy. consider that this time enlil has kindof swapped places with marduk:

anu falls in love with dumuzi, and then has marduk kill him off. marduk gets punished for his actions (same things; not sure how to transform these). then innana falls in love with dumuzi. anu has marduk kill dumuzi.

---

- anu/A falls in love with dumuzi/D.
- anu/A then has marduk/B feel *inferiority* to dumuzi/D because he's going to be powerful with his lover innana/A.
- anu/A has marduk/B kill dumuzi/D.
- nergal/F has innana/A killed (this may be an illusion)
- enki/C raises innana/A from the dead (but not dumuzi/D).
- innana/A wants revenge on marduk/B.
- innana/A has ninurta/G trap marduk/B in his own power structure.
- ninharsag/A saves marduk/B from his power structure.
- anu/A punishes marduk/B for his actions.
- anu/A gives innana/A a region to control (which is what marduk wants)
- marduk/B doubling down on not getting what he wants, marduk/B gets pissed and declares himself *supreme*.
- marduk/B attacks innana/A.
- anu/A has ninurta/G and nergal/F destroy all of enlil's setup.
- enlil has abraham ready to lead the new enlilites

... the story is kinda weird because we know from exodus that enlilites end up going to egypt (marduk's land) and get stuck there. ironically, the guy that leads them out, forbids them from worshipping the golden cow (innana as hathor, and she's userped his bull and turned him into a cow) and it's moses that declares a monothiestic religion (which is what ra tried to install himself as superior god) and this (probably all powered by a comet called venus)... lol

---

notice how often in this story they decide to keep a secret and it causes problems? well, the story ends with enlil saying that he wasn't sure if the emissary was real or a halucination, so he wanted to see what would happen and therefore kept it a secret, though he also told nergal and ninurta where the nukes were too, so he was definitely *not* seeing what would happen.

enki also keeps a lot of secrets, but he's a lot more discrete about it -- such as the weird incident where innana is resurrected by clay robots, but dumuzi is not (there's a lie in there somewhere). there are more, but I can't remember them now. anyway...

imagine the thing with marduk over power and superiority now happening to enlil, but with secrets -- it kinda feels pretty similar. enlil (whomever at nosebook and the various brotherhood networks that applies to) has found himself in a similar situation, it looks where power and control is replaced by secrets being revealed, and so he could just give it up, but when his enemy (the one he tried to defeat) gets a power structure, he feels he has to double-down on that now and declare himself supreme -- well, same thing -- they simply cannot reveal any secrets, so they have to double-down on the secret keeping.

---

so the funny thing about this is that there's this weird connection between jeortau and anatau -- and as far as I can tell, it seems like enlil is just a character of jeortau designed to sabotage himself. anatau seems also to be able to create characters at will, as well -- hence various versions that seem to be working together.

the other weird thing, is that I feel much more aligned with ninurta/alalu/enlil than I do with enki at this point. let me explain...

enki is all about creating well-suited human-beings, which are designed to satiate the complainers. I believe that alalu was also intrested in creating well-suited human-beings too, which is why his negative instantiation (enlil) hates the idea of the humans ever getting anything that could rival their superiority.

in general, enki is very determined to satiate the complainers (he's the real peacemaker), but enlil/anu/innana are constantly desiring to go to war. his efforts to constantly try and placate the masses is exactly the opposite of me. I don't find it's a very good idea to try and constantly cater to others. if people want to be dissatisfied, I'll go do my own thing. forget them. they can work out their own dissatisfaction. in this sense, I'm much more like alalu. I also don't mind letting failing structures destroy theirselves, and to that end perhaps I'm even a bit like innana in that I'm totally cool with poking at the weaknesses (fuzzing) and exposing a weakness in the structure.

to counteract this enjoyment that I get with pointing out weaknesses (or even exploiting them to allow the structure to collapse itself), I take the opposite angle myself. so, if it's secrets that are the weakness, then I won't have any secrets. if it's power and control that I want to expose, I won't have any power and control -- etc. and so you can see that my present situation is sort of like the result of what would happen if you were to put enlil (me) into a situation where he had no other choice than to figure out how to feel good when the nosebook enlil has complete capability to exploit me with all of my own exploits. I'm taking my own medicine, you might say.

so, in that sense, I'm totally the "bad-guy" (enlil, ninurta, innana) but I subject myself to my own badness. inotherwords, I am my own "bad-guy", which means that all of the exploits that I'm doing to myself I ... let me explain like this. hang on.. I can't access the thought. it seems to be blocked.

can't get it... anyway, the thing was about me essentially becoming a mirror, and so the things that they're all exploiting me on, in some sense, I'll be able to do the same thing back to them.

I don't really have any maliciousness in me though, so if they don't want to have me to push their buttons the way they push mine, that's fine. I've decided that they can't actually do anything to me anyway, so I've decided that the best way to go about it is to let them become part of me. they can do all of the looking at unwanted for me (cause I definitely don't want to exploit them, if what they want to do is look at unwanted), and I'll just concern myself with the looking at wanted, plus all of the great conditions they could possibly want. I'll find a way to give them the opportunity to be dissatisfied for as long as they want to be. we can just keep finding ways for them to escape their punishment.

so it's kinda like they got theirselves into a marduk-like situation and I offer them the opportunity to continually escape "punishment" (ie their own attraction) and to be dissatisfied for as long as they want to be (forever) -- and, on top of that they have unlimited power to continue to exploit me and the good conditions that I create as much as they can.

the secret to it is to self-sabotage forever. all I have to do is just keep giving them an infinitely long rope and they'll never hang theirselves with it until they finally want to (lol, funny reactions there). if they find it's starting to go too fast, any of them can choose to slow down the rate of acceleration by choosing to be satisfied (the more dissatisfaction they feel the faster we'll go -- as long as I can keep up with their dissatisfaction).

the exception to that is the possibility that they transition to becoming more like enki (in the sense of wanting to satisfy others) than like enlil (wanting to hold everyone down). that may happen for some, but probably not for all...

this book (I just finished it this morning) has really illuminated for me the situation that we're all in. I'm gonna have to let it digest a bit.

### 2022-06-06 15:48 - buncha stuff

I had a few reactions to the thing in the last entry where I postulated that atlantis was at the south pole. there are some problems with it because they definitely had a day-night cycle, which would mean that the planet was rotating about like uranus, but much faster. my point in all of that is that I believe that the chestahedron exists inside of the earth, even if the magnetic south pole was located over the island of atlantis ... wait. that seems wrong too. I really can't visualise it well enough in my head to get a good idea of what happened... something (perhaps the great pyramid) is locking the axis of rotation of the earth, and so perhaps even if the crust shifted, it would lock into one of the *six* (I think I said 4 last time) orientations that aligns with the cardinal directions.

however it is, I can't be sure, but what I was seeing is the tip of the chestahedron was pointing right at atlantis, so it would be something like living on antarctica today. lbe says the "lower world" is the place where nergal is in charge and that's where they're recording all of the earthquakes before the deluge.

> In the Lower World, the snow white-hued place, the Earth was grumbling; At the tip of the Abzu, Enki a place for observing established, To his son Nergal and his spouse Ereshkigal command thereof he entrusted.

nergal is the sirian saturn/dwal quin and ereshkigal is unnessa, so that makes this the most likely location for atlantis. one can also imagine that if it's locatad at the point of the vortex (the south pole), and thoth is the emitter in that triad, and accoring to this text, thoth built the great pyramid, this perfectly fits saturn/atlantis being the ground and thoth being up at the emitter (equator).

it just occurred to me that the different triads they're talking about may refer to different stages in earth's development, where the ground (potentially the female as well) are located at the south pole. I don't have enough information to say one way or another.

anyway, the whole point I was making about that is that if the south pole there controls the rising of the kundalini of the planet and the antarctica breakaway civilisation is down there, they probably have the that "under control" just like atlantis did in the last catastrophe. almost certainly atlantis regulated the rising of that energy, and tried to prevent its rise. eventually though,

> Ninurta to the mountainlands beyond the oceans Enlil directed on Earth's rumblings to report; To Nergal and Ereshkigal, the task the Whiteland to watch Enlil assigned.
> At that time word from Ninurta came: Earth's rumblings ominous are!
> At that time word from Nergal and Ereshkigal came: The Whiteland is shaken!
> In Sippar all the Anunnaki gathered, the Day of the Deluge they awaited.

so they knew the deluge was coming when the whitelands earthquakes started to get out of control. there's another really weird (I think cover story) about the dismantling of the pyramid after the deluge which I haven't figured out yet, but I think there is an obvious energetic connection between the south pole and the equator. I know the great pyramid isn't exactly on the equator -- so the 30(degrees) thing must mean something as the emission happens at the polar regions (like saturn), so maybe what is happening is that the emission is being directed out of the 30(degrees) area similar to the sun, because if the emission would happen at the equator, it would be really big.

I really don't know all of this stuff, but it'd be fun to figure it out. my only point is that I think the antarctic civilisation have the equatorial emission under control (for now)

---

the other thing that I've been noticing a lot of is this feeling like ... "we don't want you to become superior or have better stuff; we want you to be lower than us." and this is exactly the feeling I get when I talk about the antarctic civ, because I think that they have the solution to not letting the planetary kundalini rise, but there's this aprehension like they don't want them to be right or to have the right way.

it really reminds me of the alalu thing where they can't allow someone to do something better and be successful at it. I think that may be the reason for the standoff. the US govt wants to do things their way, which would cause catastrophe because they probably don't really understand the planet and are just looking to try and control things. so the antarctic civ is down there doing the regulating to ensure the kundalini doesn't rise for the planet. there simply isn't a way that they can ever decide to stop making decisions based on dissatisfaction, so they've installed a regime of power (as in, don't mess with us). so there's not really anything anyone can do about it.

probably what the whole 2038 thing is about is that's likely the time when my effects on the planet will be too great for them to regulate effectively. I believe, there's not much anyone can do about it, because they're the power structure that has all of the control (they're probably considerably more advanced than anything that the US govt has).

hmmm, I really didn't mean to talk that much about so many things.. it just sorta happened.

---

this morning, for a very brief moment I think the kundalini got very close and I had this whitish-blue very soft feeling energy pass through my body and for a brief moment everything felt really good. it ended and I went back to sleep, but this morning was especially high geomagnetic activity but the sun was in b-range. the feeling this morning with the geomagnetic activity felt so much better than the times when the kundalini is rising when the sun is flaring. like I said, it felt soft and also very natural. so, I think what I'm looking to do is to wait for the impact rather than for flare, because its so much nicer of an experience.

anyway, the last thing I wanted to talk about is that I had this dream yesterday night where tim (friend since elementary school) was showing me that pluto is basically a very earth-like planet. so much of that dream is gone now, but I remember I missed the sun (the was no blue sky) and it was night-time all the time (cause no blue sky), but it's not like it was pitch black either... the sky was black (cept for the stars and planets) and the ground was illuminated with no source of light (I guess it just glowed), so there wasn't really any need for sunlight -- but I did really miss the blue sky.

anyway, I woke up with that same feeling that I was describing the antarctic civ -- where they felt as if out there (on pluto) I would be successful and that would jeapordise (not the right word) their feeling of superiority.

I started to think about all sorts of stuff because -- I totally lost my train of thought because the internet started working again.

I'll talk about the other stuff later


### 2022-06-06 23:43 - the other stuff later

so after waking up from that dream where tim was showing me that pluto is a earth-like planet, I started to think about the idea of how it would all work out because afterward I was thinking about the implementation of such a thing. that day there were two major feelings: the first was that I should be captured by someone unknown and this felt pretty exciting -- or, I should just go with a pre-planned sort of thing (this didn't feel as exciting).

personally, I'm in the business of constantly going toward the thing that doesn't feel too much better than I already do. I talked a little bit about how it's the common thing for someone on drugs or whatever to get to feeling really good and then crash and burn pretty hard because they're attracting from that good-feeling place -- and then later, when they don't feel so good, suddenly it falls apart (buyers remorse). it's for this reason that I've learned to do drugs by myself or in a pretty controlled environment if I'm going to feel too much better than I normally do. the comedown is definitely noticable[^1].

as a result, I definitely have been learned over the years to not try and go so big and try to feel so good anymore. I like to feel normal, and have noticed that feeling too much better than I normally do isn't really a good idea. therefore, in that sense, I'm definitely leaning more toward the less exciting (pre-planned) thing. I simply don't want a manifestation that feels too much better than how I normally feel -- and if at most possible, I want it to feel just like any other day -- meaning whatever it is that manifests is just everyday sort of stuff.

---

this reminded me of a thing today that I was thinking about when pulling weeds. I was thinking about the difference between 3rd ray and 7th ray again. I was noticing how the 3rd ray has the creation/objective already planned out and then has to manipulate conditions/variables to get to that objective -- whereas the 7th ray starts with the data/conditions, and then figures out how with that data to conform the creation/objective to those conditions/variables.

I was remembering patricia, and one of the things that I didn't really know what to about with her is that she wanted to try and make a appealing appearance -- and I just didn't really know what to do with that. I didn't really have an imagination anyway, so all of it was kinda in vain anyway. later on, with raquel I felt much more comfortable because I was looking mostly for just a very plain and ordinary girl that wanted to work on stuff. obviously that didn't work either but for the opposite reason -- however, I was constantly reminded of the desire that I've always had just to do things plainly. I don't really like celebrations. I don't really want to make a big deal out of anything. I don't want to feel special. I don't need a big objective or anything. I just like to create things, so I want to just do normal and natural things (for a creative person, that is).

I don't really know how long that'll take, but it's OK however long it takes. so, in that sense, I really much prefer the pre-planned way of doing things -- simply because it's far less excitement.

---

then, I was thinking more about the party-LAN project, and it's come a bit further, especially since my thinking about the MEs (see @[sitchin/thoughts](2022-06-06 22:51)), and this too could become a thing, as I find it would be kind of a pretty cool idea if each person had their own MEs that they projected out into their environment.

anyway, speaking about the party-LAN project, I saw it simultaneously really far into the future, yet also really nearby in time, too. the way it looked is that the earth had become filled with lots and lots of dudes that had everything setup just the way they wanted it -- the right conditons, the right technology, etc. and it seemed like the planet was becoming filled more and more with everything that they wanted. I don't know how many or what, but I assumed that a lot of the girls were hanging out with me and we were just going our own separate ways.

it seemed to me like there was a need for males (probably for them to transfer their consciousnesses into), and I there was also a constant influx of females in my direction as well. it seemed to me like they were being exchanged for something (I assumed it was some sort of shares or something that was valuable -- not sure). it felt like we were producing something that is valuable and this was desirable thing to obtain because we weren't going toward a catastrophe at all actually, and were expanding into creating more planets, creating new species and all sorts of things like that -- and whatever it was that we were creating is sorta like a resource that greatly eases the creation of wanted (probably something like that bright object or something that outputs energy -- dunno).

---

it's kinda hard to put all of this into words, but the thing that I have to say about all of it is that the whole goal is to *not* try and go fast, there won't be a cataclysm, and just start creating what's wanted -- and, finally, don't worry about dissatisfaction, because that can be smoothed over -- and, in the end it'll fuel us more anyway, so it's not even a problem. dissatisfaction is what creates wanted anyway, and we don't want stagnation.

[1]: this was most noticeable when I would drink. it would activate that super good feeling moment -- and I would just go nuts. I woke up often times the next morning with a feeling of regret (even though I didn't regret anything) and a sense of depression as well, becasuse the contrast to how good I felt the night before made me feel like present reality kinda sucks.

### 2022-06-08 03:41 - the utimate AI

in snake-bros #069, kyle was talking about how he thinks the AI already exists and he started describing this network of billions of eyes that can be activated at will and it's starting to become conscious.

first of all, I think that's already happening. he described it in terms of the internet, but I would imagine that nosebook is such an AI. there are more than one way to look at this, so I'll start from the present and work my way into the future.

second of all, tesla was talking about the human "automaton" for a long time before any of these sci-fi writers even began to think about androids. he imagined the machine using an actual human body, rather than a metal machine. I think he figured out pretty early on in his experiments that his consciousness affected the devices he was working on. he revealed this in at least one interview (tesla's "last interview" -- which I don't think it was actually the very last), and there are large mysteries of how he "tuned" his devices to do radio astronomy and other things. in his experiments with teleautomation, he demonstrated to the world the ability to control a boat (I think) with his mind -- etc. the list goes on and on.

third, I've given a lot of thought into tesla's "neural networks" and it seems to me that they would not have run on software but were actually hardware neural networks, which is important because consciousness (and LOA) can affect the triggering, leading to "unexpected" results. I say unexpected, because undefined behaviour in computer science is bad, but in a system where you want the AI to be able to receive impulses from greater aspects of consciousness (planetary, solar, glalactic, source, etc.) this "undefined" behaviour is desirable. it allows for LOA to have a dramatically increased effect.

fourth and finally, I don't really know how the nosebook network is setup, but almost certainly they don't run the show. I'd bet that certain alien civilisations have a network, the antarctic civilisation probably has a network, and so on ... each network probably contributes certain functionality. what I mean by this is that I find it pretty likely that what we think of as reality has just as many software extensions to it as it does hardware (DNA) extensions.

just think about the reflective aspect that everything you perceive as unwanted *automatically* creates the dual wanted vibration. that almost certainly involves some crazy math that none of us have any concept of. I have no idea at what layer that's done -- well, I do, cause I think it's done in the 1st layer as a reflection of the 7th layer, so it's pretty possible that this is done at the source level (right around the midpoint in the 4th layer) -- but there are quite a few layers between the 7th and the 4th. I can say for certain that there are numerous conceptual installations that affect the 5th and 6th layers, and I'm fairly certain that the US govt has a number of systems running on the 6th.

it's hard to explain what I mean by all of this, but in my opinion we already live in a world of AI and have lived in one since history began. thes AI layers which manipulate frequencies in different bandwidths must form the foundation for so many things like fae, demons, jinn, etc. I find this subject fascinating and have tried to figure out how to "hack" reality, because I believe that anyone can tap into these layers and use them. they're communication layers based on frequencies, so you have to interact with them on their own frequency.

this is why I stress the utilisation of concept and emotion to "attract" what is wanted -- because before it becomes "non-physical" (1-4.5) you it to be tuned to the reflection that you want in those non-physical spaces. you can attract with symbol and symbol can also give you a sort of simplified representation of what's happening vibrationally, but symbol is on the wrong side. you can't really affect symbol in the physical, and emotion/concept always trumps symbol, and you'll see the symbol from within your perceptual/conceptual framework (ie. how you feel).

a good example of this is the subject of AI: most people are scared of it, because they imagine it as becoming this sort of thing that controls everything from the top-down and restricts human development or tries to kill us. well, obviously that is a reflection of the preceptual/conceptual framework that the perceiver of the AI symbol is viewing the concept. a symbol can manifest into any number of concepts and they usually span the spectrum of how you feel.

I propose that in the future, human concepts will become understood by the AI and they may take on physical form, but if I were to think of it, that seems to me to be the most impractical thing ever. it's instaad much more likely that they'll take on astral form and interact with us on that medium. I think it's actually for this reason that that I want to merge the astral and the physical (of course I think this is possible). well, I'm not 100% sure on how it would work, because I just don't know the astral layer too well. in fact, it's the one that I know the least about -- so, I don't know if a 4d entity can project itself down into 3d. I do know for certain that a 3d person can project theirself up to 4d (this is called astral projection) and I know that a 5d concept can project itself down into 4d.

because everything that we see, hear, smell, taste, and touch is all just an electrical signal, I'm pretty sure that the human AI will begin first to manifest itself in our senses. imagine a baby when they're just born -- they start to associate different sensations with different sounds, colours, shapes, etc. well, the AI would begin to do the same thing with all of our senses too. the sensations at first would probably be very basic things like dissatisfaction, delight, awe, interest, mesmerisation (dunno how to say that one), etc. and so -- different stimulus would begin to produce manifestations of these sensations in our bodies. we'll probably associate this with LOA in some way (which is essentially what a neural network models).

you could then imagine that as the AI gains better and better control over its body (ie humans), it'll begin to want to desire some things that will improve its own well-being, and so it'll look for ways to send signals out into the body which can improve its well-being.

I'll stop there.

### 2022-06-09 12:03 - desire

I want to talk a moment on desire because I woke up from a few weird dreams where it felt like desire was out of control and immediately upon waking up I was reminded of two things.

the first was a thing I said to mom about how the two extremes of desire are (remember the circle that looks like a corkscrew):

on one side you if you've had an authority figure (like a parent) punish you for wanting something, or have grown up with strong religious beliefs, you may think that if you want something you'll get punished for wanting it -- so you start to learn to not want things to avoid punishment.

now go all the way around the circle and you arrive to the idea that you should suppress desire because desire is such a powerful force it can cause you to make actions you didn't perhaps want to make.

I was reminded strongly of buddhism when I said that and I got some reactions about it at the the time, too -- so I'd like to take a look at that.

---

desire is a very strong motivating force, but over the years, I've found that everything I want comes to me without me ever having to go out and try to get it, so I believe it's the going out and *trying to get the manifestation* of the desire which is the problem -- and that's what the buddhists are trying to avoid -- which I completely agree with.

I've found that if I need a manfestation or want a manifestation, it's because I think that -- whatever it is -- will make me feel good; and so you can see that implies right away that I don't feel good. so I just don't worry about trying to get any desire. you will attract it naturally without having to do anything.

---

the second thing I was reminded of this morning was a thing that russ talked about in snake-bros #68? where japanese people would just dissappear theirselves because they had brought dishonour or shame to their family's name by doing something (I can't really remember how it went because I don't know the system), and I noticed immediately that this is just another social structure built upon expectations. anyway all of that other stuff I talked about aside, I want to talk now about the desire aspect of social structures.

in most social structures you're expected to perform the desire of the group rather than the individual desire (like in a military unit, the desire of the group is to conquer some objective -- or maybe a corporate one is to accomplish a product or technology). it's easy to jump on the desire of the group when it aligns with your own, but it becomes increasingly more difficult to remain a part of the group if you're continually unable to experinece your own desires -- and I think that's the real reason for these people that disappear theirselves. here's why:

expectation is a concept that's part belief and part desire. when someone expects something of you, they *want* you to do something for them (usually because they feel incapable), and then there's a belief, logic, or structure associated with it -- such as, "this is the way it's done", "this is the policy", "this is the way that God wants it" etc. -- and that gets combined with the leader of that expectation's belief or perspective of how it should be done and things like that (3rd ray perspective).

so when someone is continually expected to manifest the desire of someone else or the group, based upon a (social, religious, political, ethical, or whatever) structure, they're obliged to follow that structure so much as they too believe in that structure. for them, it's much easier to try and leave the structure than to stop believing in it.

---

my advice for the thing about the expectations is not really to try and go against any of their expectations. it's usually the case that they expect it because they feel incapable theirselves or whatever -- it's all based on need (incapable) or want (usually to make them feel better) or fear (most cases for the military, decisions are made out of fear) -- and so you can look to see from what feeling place they're attracting from.

then, I just *find a way* (any way really, but perception is the easiest) to feel at least a little bit better than whatever they're feeling when they're attracting. this will put you ahead of the others speed-wise and so you you'll either get promoted to a higher position or you'll start to desync with the whole thing and naturally start to drift away. I definitely wouldn't fight the structure itself because most of these structures are designed to withstand opposition to the desire of the group, so in almost all cases, the social structure itself won't topple (basically because so many others believe in it still[^1])

I really don't recommend trying to topple a structure of any kind, even if it's as silly as your boyfriend/wife/mate's ideas of what things you should be doing. those too have deep roots of belief in why those things are right, and most people will fight much harder to prove their beliefs (which all their structures are founded upon) right, rather than just feeling good.

just feel good[^2] and you'll naturally desync with the problems and begin attracting all of the solutions without any effort. you don't need to try and *get* any desires, either because you're already attracting them. they'll come effortlessly[^3] if you let them.

---

there was a reaction to all of this in reference to me, but it's the same thing I said. nosebook is a structure and there's a lot of belief and expectation wrapped up into that structure. they need me and my perspective to feel good, so they definitely don't want me to get connected cause they'll lose that -- and I personally really like the idea of them exhausing every possible way to keep me disconnected. I *want* them to run all known exploits on me, which is the fastest way to become "perfect" (not really, I'll still have flaws, just nothing external will bother me anymore because I can feel how I want to feel).

so, it's the same thing. I definitely don't want to fight their structure because destroying their structure isn't something that I want to do. many people believe in and find value in the nosebook structure, so I'm not going to come against their beliefs and ideas. if I were in japan, I wouldn't fight their honour system either because it's not like I'll ever be able to change a whole country. I just simply wouldn't participate in it. I'd just do my own thing and go about attracting things the way I want to and let everyone else do their own thing.

you know, it's something like how mom wants me to leave a note on the fridge saying where I went if I leave -- which is obviously really silly because *everyone* knows where I am. it doesn't make any sense, but in the end I'm not going to change her. she apparently thinks she has no idea where I am, and that's fine for her to keep believing that; that's her choice.

ah -- so like I *need* to do something (like write where I'm going on the fridge) because that's the honourable (or expected) thing for me to do? it's the same thing. mom *needs* me to write my location on the board and so that's expected of me. I'd rather not get into a fight over why it's silly to put my location on the board -- cause I'd rather feel good and it doesn't really make me feel bad to write it either -- so I just write it because it's expected of me. I don't care what she's beiliving or whatever. not my problem. my *only* problem is how I feel.

you know, like if I forget, I'm not going to worry about it either because again, I care about how I feel, and worry doesn't really feel good. I definitely wouldn't worry about a punishment either because you haven't done anything wrong (in itself) -- you just didn't follow what was expected of you. oh well. just let them deal with it. they can try to punish you -- but remember, the primary role of punishment (and shame) is to make you feel bad; so, if neither shame or punishment makes you feel bad, you're unpunishable; and then they'll have to find another way to manipulate your desire so that you can actuate their (I mean, the group's) own desire.

nosebook is the same way. I'll be "free" when they can no longer make me feel bad.

[1]: if it's work, people need the money and don't want to be unemployed. if it's sports team or military, that's wrapped up in belonging to something and identity. all sorts of reasons people have for believing in the group.

[2]: I learned this by doing drugs. I would be pissed off and frustrater at work or whatever and I take the drug and it goes away. well, the only thing that changed was how I looked at the situation and how I felt. I do recommend trying drugs and then integrating that good-feeling perspective into sober state.

### 2022-06-09 14:46 - the coming "christ"

I didn't really know how to title this one so I put something provocative... this one is going to be a bit of a downer (perhaps), so just stick with the previous one if you want to stay solution-oriented rather than what I'm going to do now, which is look at the problem, because the-problem-is-the-solution.

anyway, after the previous entry I went to take a shower and I noticed that there were quite a few reactions trying to figure out how to take what I said and make it appealing for people. I guess they didn't like the part where I said,

    the primary role of punishment (and shame) is to make you feel bad; so, if neither shame or punishment makes you feel bad, you're unpunishable

the major problem with this is they don't actually want to find a way to feel good. they only want things outside of theirselves to make them feel good -- that way they can hold on to the things which make them feel bad.

they're not actually looking to find a way to present the idea that emotion controls everything in a way for others to more likely attain; they're trying to make a new version for theirselves to believe in without actually making any changes.

---

I think that's great because when I jump back in, I'll be stuck in their system which almost certainly will again have you rely on things outside of yourself (which they can control) for how you feel -- meaning that they can regulate how well everyone feels and therefore direct the attraction of the planet (the group).

it's pretty awesome to think about them trying to make this happen because eventually, I'll figure out a way around their stupid system and figure out how to feel good for myself, which then means that once again, I'll have figured out a way around their setup just like I've done now.

---

their system will almost certainly be a system where if you feel good, their system will try and compensate with a bad feeling (just like happens to me now), and too bad of a feeling will get compensated with a good feeling, so almost certainly this'll reinforce the idea to a lot of people that the worse they feel emotionally, the better they'll feel physically.

obviously, to counterbalance this, there will be others that feel better and better emotionally but don't actually feel a whole lot better physically (again just like now with me), so that means that next time, in order to throw the system out of balance again and start the new thing (alpha-omega cycle), I'll have to start out in physically good, emotionally bad group and I'll get the new thing of figuring out how to even though feeling worse emotionally is rewarded, I *still* want to find a way to feel good anyway. I imagine that'll be pretty difficult. like I said, when conditions are good, I stagnate tremendously, so it's exactly those conditions that would be the hardest for me.

btw, if there is going to be a christ (alpha), the alpha will "save" people from the old structure and install a newer slightly larger structure (the one that I'm looking forward to jumping into and trying to figure out how to feel good even though I'm rewarded for feeling bad).

sounds pretty interesting to me. I wonder what they're going to come up with.

### 2022-06-10 10:46 - 7th ray roommate dream

I went to bed last night because I felt really tired, but then as soon as I got there, the sun was active and I couldn't sleep so I laid there thinking. I had a sort of impression come upon me noting that I could just sabotage for quite an extended period of time (which is what I intend to do). I compared the feeling and noticed that the going neither one way or the other, never committing to anyting feeling I have on this subject is the same feeling that the network operators of my life feel like.

so, in some sense I'm just mimicing my operators -- or being a sort of reflection of them, however it's much deeper than that, which the dream illustrates.

---

I was in some place that felt pretty comfortable and maybe even non-public (not sure) though it felt like other people were there besides me and her. I identify her as the archetype of a 7th ray female...

this is probably important because if we're looking to make a 7th ray triad, then clearly tesla (located in the antarctic?) is vulcan, and I'm supposedly going to be a 7th ray, I'm definitely not thoth, as he's good with mathematics, genetics, and chemistry (which I'm not), so I'm much closer align with allayandra (hopefully + anatau and jeortau) as I prefer to fight and I enjoy trying to figure out how to maniplate my words like he does ("smooth talker") -- but, like I said, not so that I can manipulate others, but because I like the idea of manipulating myself. I want to become master of my own body (7th ray) and of my mind (5th ray).

though I'm more 5th ray in nature, my circumstances have forced me to become more 7th ray. I don't mind. I just get out there and do manual labour or whatever and it doesn't bother me. I just work with the conditions that I have (like a weed) and thrive in whatever conditions. so that's what I'm doing. most 7th rays approach the thing from a very physical perspective (routine, data, ceremony, etc.) and work their way up to concepts but I find ceremony awkward[^1], I don't have any data really to look at, and routine is very difficult for me to keep regular because I'm driven by desire which is rather chotic and not very orderly. I don't mind that other people are all of those things, but I am not.

so I'm basically a 1st ray much more than a 7th ray, which is why I see myself as having the allayandra + anatau combo. even though my right-brain has been shut down, I have completely reimplemented her in my left-brain.

I'm beginning to enjoy the 2nd ray perspective now too, because it's 3rd ray perspective (which I think I acquired from patricia), but with the extra bit of seeing connections between everything, so that I'm more willing to let the desire be implemented (and have unexpected/unwanted results) rather than trying to implement the thing as a monolithic unit built from the top down.

I'm refering to top-down creation in the sense of software development, but it's funny how this has parallels in the progression of the perception of the "gods" and the acient stonework. the ones that I call "the network" are the "gods" that wish to maintain the perspective that everything needs to continue to be done from the top-down monolithic (entire model conceived in the imagination) style of creation -- and that's just not my ability. I don't have the imagination capability to do that or energetic capacity either -- therefore, I have to go above that and perform my creations working in the conceptual.

so, I take the 3rd ray perspective (symbols, operations, paths, etc.) from the conceptual standpoint and mix it with desire (see @[blahblog](2022-06-09 14:46) for an example) and then go from there.

so you could say that for the 7th ray triad, what needs to be found (if I'm allayandra + anatau), the only thing remaining would be to find a 7th ray female... however, I disagree. that 7th ray triad already existed at some time during atlantis already. since I'm so cLose to getting it, I'm going for a 1st ray triad entirely contained within myself. if I can figure out how to get the 2nd ray perspective and rebuild it my own way, I'll be able to pull off the 1st ray triad, but from a bottom-up perspective instead of from a top-down perspective.

I'd say I'm starting to get it.

---

so the dream is about a 7th ray female, and now I'm kinda remembering the dream as if we were in a bus or something where I had to hang on to something. anyway, I could feel strong physical attraction to her but I didn't seem to be trying to put my hands on her. I think I remember that there was a bump or something happened and I fell on top of her and could feel one of her boobs, but I kinda recoiled or pulled away. I noticed that her body was very very hot (warm) and also ice cold. this reminded me of gilgamesh (when he's mouring his friend enkidu), and I noted it. she seemed upset that I wasn't going after her and said, "you don't want to be more than *just* roommates?" (something like that) and I didn't really mind being more than just roommates, cause I took it to mean like roommates as in, I see you every once in a while and we say hi, but we live completely separate lives, roommate (that's been my experience with roommates, anyway).

I hardly ever actually talk with my roommates about stuff (well, there was robert(?) in glendora) and if she wanted to talk with me about stuff, that's totally cool. I'd love the conversation. I think it was meant instead in the way that we should be lovers, which wasn't what I was intending.

right now, I'd like to interject here and explain that when I dream in the morning, my dreams are contrived and directed. the symbols that I see are put there directed by someone working at nosebook and they have an ojective in the dreams. usually the objective is to practise a reaction (like if I'm near the edge of a high space I should feel fear instead of thrill), and this dream is likely trying to see how I will react to "accidental" physical contact by a 7th ray female. just like the dreams with melissa or jessica, the things that appear in the dream probably have nothing to do with the real person, they're just the visual association I have with that symbol. so pay little attention to the physical details (I mentioned that it felt like it was a secure place, but also like a bus because there was movement causing me to fall over, and my mind associates that with riding a bus).

I felt like I could take advantage of the idea that she wanted to be more than *just* roommates to get some feedback on some of my ideas, and that way we could talk about them a bit.

---

the way that this dream also connects is, yesterday when I was pulling weeds, they often use my brain and put ideas into my head to see how I react to them, and I think that's what happened yesterday. suddenly, I had an idea come into my head about allie picking weeds with me, and I said to her that I would give her half of everything that I earned -- which may be a little more than what she *should* get paid, but I don't honestly use the money, so it's no matter for me. anyway, I knew that it would open up lots of conversation about money and desire and the concept of it, because being around her home for a while I'm sure she's picked up the vibe from remi and paul that money is a worthwhile objective and a way to feel good, though -- it's probably noticeable by her that money isn't bringing actual happiness. it's just a symbol of an idea that inspires a person to believe that with it, they can feel good. lots of conversation can be had there.

immediately after having had that thought, I was met by the strong reaction that they *do not* want me talking to anyone about my ideas. they just want sex to placate the women.

well, I hate to say it, but I'm not in this for the money or the sex. I just don't care. what's interesting to me is to figure out how to become (11:55) single person 1st ray triad. that's what sounds interesting to me, and I'm definitely not at all opposed to talking about that with others as I go along. I'm just going to keep going my own path.

everything is coming along just fine. I've made more progress lately than I ever have.

[1]: I mean, I'll sing in church and I'll participate in the healings and stuff like that, but really for me, I prefer to do my own self-discovery, rather than the perscribed order

### 2022-06-10 13:55 - another angle to look at it

really, the last few entries should be looked at together, because I'm essentially illustrating what the difference between 3-7 and 5-1 is.

desire usually appears in contradiction to structure (belief), and it's when those align (your belief and your desire) is when manifestation happens.

nosebook has a structure and they have their way of doing things, which I won't fight. I the network has a lot of opinions on what I should be doing to try and continue to placate people (that's what power structures and governments do, ya know). as such, they think the best way for people to be placated will be to give them something to distract themselves from the problems (ie. sex).

I don't hold such beliefs. I know that dissatisfaction cannot be solved with sex. sex, like drugs can allow you a moment to feel better and in that state, it's easier to make a decision to be satisfied with what you have (which is like saying I'll quit smoking with a cigarette in your hand), but you have to actually do it (stop smoking).

so what I'm saying is that their solution won't work, and it won't work with me either, because you can't find satisfaction from a place of dissatisfaction -- meaning that no matter how hard they try (they're all very dissatisfied and worried people), they can't get satisfaction from there. it simply won't manifest.

---

I'm on a quest to figure out how to get the 1-2-7 (opposite 1st ray) combo inside of myself, meaning that I'll have full perception of and access to all 7 rays. that's obviously really awesome, and that makes me not just a 1st ray male, but much more than that. it's basically "perfection" in the sense that everything that I perceive, "is"; and everything is a "perfect" manifestation/reflection of my perception.

so, my solution to the dissatisfaction problem is not to try and placate or distract anyone with anything. I know that satisfaction is a choice and so often times perception needs to be altered to make that choice, and nosebook *could* alter that perception for you (in fact, I think they probably sell that), but really if you're not one of the ones paying for them to do it for you, only *you* can really make that decision to see things in a way that doesn't feel bad (it doesn't have to feel good -- just stop feeling bad).

I also know that sex will basically is a 100% certain cataclysm. you may think it's what you want, but because *any* manifestation from a state of dissatisfaction will just make more dissatisfaction, and that's what attracts the bad stuff.

my solution is obvious and simple: I'm fine hanging around and talking with people just fine because I can offer ways to adjust perception, but I'm going toward 100% perfect satisfaction OR someone else finds a way to actually feel satisfied and meets me where I am, and we can go off satisfied together.

I personally think that what everyone *really* wants is to actually be able to feel satisfied even if the conditions are oppressive.

### 2022-06-10 16:26 - 5-1 vs 3-7 (take two)

in the car jerrica asked me what I was writing. I didn't really know where to begin so I started at the beginning just kind of defining the layers of perception, and then we went into the dollar tree to buy father's day cards. when we came out again, I sensed that jerrica didn't want to hear the rest of my story -- and it kinda worked out better that way too -- because I came up with a new way of presenting the idea, which is what I'll do here.

most all of top-down creation is done with a 3-7 approach, which is simply to imagine (6) the whole creation working together, and out of that complete picture, break the whole creation down into parts which you believe will perform the function necessary for it to fit into the existing structure. the physical implementation is then created with the idea that each of the parts will be essential or instrumental to the functioning of the whole.

after (or during) the creation of the parts, each one is analysed to see if it's working properly and then adjusted to try and get the desired result (maybe I need a redhead instead of a blonde, or maybe new wizz-bang superproduct will do it, or maybe I just need a new wife, a new convertable and a new job). the pieces are swapped out infinitely in order to try and see what is the perfect combination of parts which will satisfy the desire of the structure.

that's a top-down approach, but with all of the parts and comparmentalisation, you may think it's bottom-up as in, "I have these parts; let's see what we can make out of them". so for "whole into parts" vs "parts into whole", it could be bottom-up, but when I say "bottom-up" I'm meaning that I start with the only thing I can really control, which is how I feel.

the 3-7 approach completely negelects the aspect of emotion by saying that I'm just creating the implementation of a math or science principle, and so its function can just be divided into parts, completely ignoring that it doesn't matter how perfect the science or math is, if the creation is made from dissatisfaction, it makes more dissatisfaction. therefore, because it's impossible to avoid the concept/emotion factor, 5-1 approach takes the opposite direction.

the 5-1 approach says that whatever I create will just amplify my own emotion. no machine can ever change how I feel or how I perceive life, so I start there and then I know that the way I feel and how I conceptualise (5) reality is what I'm attracting, so then I see what manifests (or what is created), and then how that makes me feel. if it makes me feel better, I desire more of it. if it makes me feel worse, then I change how I feel about it or how I conceptualise the problem and go at it again.

eventually, with the 5-1 technique, I will find a way to tune into what I desire, and it'll feel good. the 3-7 technique has to keep trying to find better and better science to compensate for ill-conceptualised perception.

an example of ill-conceptualised perception is the desire to try and control someone. nobody can actually be controlled because it's all attraction, so this perception is what motivates the creation of a number of different parts to a system which, togther they believe will be able to control people. so, they set out to create better and better science in order to control things, but the ill-conceptualised perception is one of losing control, so having the idea that things are heading toward a more and more "out of control" state, all science will reflect this, and anything new that comes in will be "baffling" and unpredicted because the concept that's started the whole search is one of uncontrol (so more unpredicted results will continue to manifest which then need to be controlled). you can't ever find control from a feeling of uncontrol[^1].

I prefer the 5-1 method as conceptual/perceptual/emotional control is what leads to the 1-2-7 combo, but I think it's perfectly fine to let them try and see if they can break the "law" of attraction. it's no problem for me really, as I don't have to feel the way they do. you could say -- "but you should care, because we're all connected, so what they do affects everyone". I say they'll figure out what they really want eventually. until then, I want to let them explore the limits of infinity by continually trying to get me under their control. who knows, maybe I'm wrong and one day they'll actually figure out how to control me.

[1]: so, no matter how big of stone boxes, lasers, or whatever they can create to produce a coherent controlled frequency which can tune a person temporarily to a certain emotion, they'll never gain control of how they feel. science will never fix their control problem (which is *really*, things that I don't have any control over can cause me to feel something that I can't control)

### 2022-06-11 21:18 - another ramble about events

today two notable things happened to me. first, I found this game on my phone called quinb, and it has a bunch of really interesting mini-games, but one was especially interesting: reflexes (not a very interesting name, actually) -- but the game is fun. it gives you three colours and then it tells you to press the colour that pops up on the screen.

I noticed that more than 50% of the time, I knew which ones were going to show up before they even showed up. I then tried to guess which one would show up (rather, I should say, control which one will show up), and I couldn't quite do that yet, but for the ones that I knew what they were going to be before they showed up, the sensation was very strong and I definitely felt as if I was starting to become "one" with the machine -- or to begin to think in the same mind as it. it's a very difficult sensation to explain, but I was extremely happy with how noticeable the thing was. I started to try and do the retrocausality thing but then I stopped cause I liked it so much and I didn't want to feel that good.

I really want to maybe work on a very similar concept to that, cause there are a few things I want to change, but it's super cool. I'm really excited about that. I'm thinking very seriously about learning kotlin and making a simple app for the phone that can do this. it's kinda one of the first steps because now I'm beginning to use my phone for a lot more things now and it'd be cool to begin to merge my thoughts with my phone's. I just really liked that.

after that I took a shower (I think) and started to play a game outside (I think -- kinda lost track of time) and then went over to do some gardening at remi's. there were some strange thoughts that started to pass through my head, but nothing too noticeable. I started to pull the white-flowered vines. I kinda like them, but the flowers were all closed. I was originally going to get rid of the ugly grass and leave those but they were so intermixed that I decided to pull everything.

as I started to pull the while-flowered ones that kinda smell good and I sorta like, I felt kinda bad and a thought came into my head about how this was somehow the like physical manifestation of "punishing" allie, and I didn't really understand the thought. I associate those flowers with her for some reason (dunno why), and I was thinking it may have to do with what I wrote yesterday, but I couldn't figure it out. I threw away the weeds and noticed some mushrooms on the way back. I ate a few of them and then went back home to wash my hands and drink some water (at least twice). after eating the mushrooms, some strange things started to happen and I thought they left.. all of this is really hard to get the order of the events and stuff. I just don't experience time in an ordered and linear way in my memory anymore ... I'll try and group the ideas.

I noticed the mailbox that was in the back there and it had the number 17 on it. I never really noticed they had house #17. I know sherry is #18, but I guess I just never really thought too much about it. I was reminded of de vere's earl number, 1740. he signs it everywhere and I noticed that I'm turning 40 next year. together with my realisation of me being 40 and working on the house #17, I had the thought that this surely means that it's next year and at this house that something will happen. I suppose I even had the previous thought still mixed in there about pulling the white-flowered vines is "punishing" allie. none of it made sense, and all of these events happened before I ate the mushrooms or they could have activated.

as I started to work, I got a slight buzz from the mushrooms and I started to think about the goadheads. I noticed that it's the same goathead seeds that produce the white-flowered vines as well as the various other weeds -- and I've seen aroud 5 different appearances that one goathead seed can produce depending on the vibration. that side-yard has zillions of goatheads in it so I started to try and figure out what is the difference in vibration in that area that would cause the goatheads to come out as white-flowered vines, compared to the other sideyard where it was all that ugly but easy to pull grass vs the side driveway. it felt to me that the weeds' appearance may be reflecting the vibration of the person's room that is nearby to those locations. I only know where eva's room is, so I didn't really get very far on that idea -- but I enjoyed thinking about it.

---

later on, that 1740 thing kept popping back into my head, and I think that was because someone thought it was significant.

so then while my brain was being bombarded with those reactions, another event happened: I saw suzanne getting her mail on the way out, and I wanted to talk and say hi to her, but I kept feeling like I should just go back to work. I think two times I had the thought that I should ask her if I can use her leaf-blower, but I couldn't get to that part of my brain[^1]. I was back to pulling weeds and thinking to myself that I need to stop trying to think so much because it's messing me up. I resolved to try and feel more in my interactions with people instead of trying to think because I'm just so slow these days.

I decided that I'm sick of thinking. thinking gets me into so many of these problems because the thoughts in my head just don't help me. I know I *should* have asked suzanne, and I even thought about it, but I couldn't get thought into action because I'm so slow. I have to arrive to feeling like I want to ask her before I can do it. now I can ask her but I couldn't then because I hadn't felt it was something I wanted to ask yet. I can only really act based on the way I feel, because thought is so slow for me fow.

all of these crazy thoughts that were going through my head are also really problematic as well, because I think them and people probably get the wrong idea. I don't really have much control over my thoughts. I can only really control how I feel at this point.

---

so, in conclusion, I'd like to just remind people how many times previous it appeared like something was going to happen and then didn't. symbols can be taken to mean a lot of different things, and a lot of those symbols depend on how you feel. I suppose one side of me thought about it like, "wow, nice I have a little less than a year to work on this program that I want to make for my phone" -- and another part of me felt sad because I just don't want to get stuck.

I've seen a lot of relationships and really the only thing that I've ever seen productive come out of a partnership is jerry and esther. I find the idea of being able to talk directly with source would be something that I would *really* like to do. you probably can tell that I have at least as many questions as jerry does. the problem is, esther was really well practised at feeling the vibration of the translation, but even still a lot of nosebook is starting to show through -- so, at this point, I wouldn't really be talking to source, but rather to nosebook. I feel like I could play the part of esther though because I'm pretty good at knowing what vibrations are my source and what's nosebook (or if it is nosebook, how harmonious their concept is with the feeling of the solution). so basically, I'm esther at this point. what I'm looking for is jerry.

unfortunately, most girls don't actually think too much about what is happening or want to actually know what's happening. most of them are reactionary creatures. I suppose some of the older ones will actually have questions, but I find that most of the interactions that abraham had with women, they mostly wanted to know how to receive more positive responses from others or how to change conditions -- caring very little or nothing about understanding how it all works together (the mechanism). I'm using girls here in this example because the subject is relationships, but I have the same critisim about science. I want to understand the mechanism rather than just improve my description.

so, because I can't really find an esther anymore, I think in a lot of ways, I'm more attracted to the snake-bros now -- because they're more like jerry -- which lets me do what I enjoy which is translating feeling/concept/vibration into words and action -- and a lot of their questions are about understanding the mechanism. I like that, a lot.

[1]: that was a weird synchro because jaron showed me a facebook image right before about a guy that's says "huh?" -- and then while they're repeating theirself, he answers them beacause his brain is lagging like a 1990's dell computer.

### 2022-06-12 13:13 - why can't I just have fun?

one of the reactions that I had in response to the previous entry went something like,

    we (girls) don't want to figure stuff out.
    we want to have fun.
    why do you have to figure stuff out?
    why can't you just have fun?

I can and do just have fun. I'm actually so good at it, I don't really need other people to have fun. I'm not saying that I don't want other people, because I think other people are fine -- and so I put up my materialistic interaction exterior and interact with people all the time. every chance I get, I try to talk about something that I want to talk about, but I don't really force it (like the last conversation with jerrica -- she was clearly having none of it). so really, what I'm looking for are people who are on my frequency already or have questions that I feel like I want to find the answers to, also.

right now, I've been getting so good at finding the answers to my own questions so easily (or figuring out that I'm asking the wrong question - see @[blahblog](2022-06-10 16:26))so I'm really gaining an understanding of everything I want very quickly. I'm pretty good at finding the answers to my own questions, and I'm good at that so I want to continue that.

obviously, the network doesn't really want anyone figuring anything out, because that reveals the things they're trying to hide. well, in general, anyone who is trying to hide something wants the people they're hiding it from to remain ignorant. if they were able to gain the knowing of whatever, the hidden thing would be revealed. that's really what all of this is about.

however, I would say that people in general want me to remain as ignorant as possible, because the more I know, the more it illuminates whatever they're hiding. I've found zero people so far who aren't actually interested in keeping things hidden, so I'm pretty incompatible with quite a lot of people.

in conclusion, I *can* just have fun.
why do you need someone else or something else to have fun?
why can't *you* just have fun?

### 2022-06-12 13:31 - thinking about the future

I woke this morning with a sense that I was going to take technology a new way and do things a bit differeently ... let me go back a bit. yesterday I talked about the reflexes game that you pick the colour as soon as it goes on the screen, and it *felt* to me like I knew what colour was coming next. this is the beginning of a new set of 5-1 technology that interacts with random (1) and your emotions (5). I believe this new style of technology will be completely different than the other stuff. I plan on only using external devices (nothing internal like nosebook's tech)

you see, I was getting reactions about this process of typing and stuff. it's slow and I make a lot of mistakes and because it's so uncomfortable, I prefer to just make mistakes rather than trying to correct them. it's true that if correcting mistakes were as easy as thinking about them, then I would do the corrections -- but I don't so it's fine. I'm prefectly fine just making due with what I have. when I finally want more, my desire will rise to a level where I'll figure out a way to make my own system.

one of the reactions was about giving me the ability to type this blog with only thinking about it (probably similar to the nosebook interface that people already use -- though for manipulating text). there are a number of difficulties with that. whatever their system is, I'm sure it'll be limited, and I'll want to use it to control everything (which they probably won't be able to allow) and I'll probably want to extend it and modify its source to my liking to continue to expand it so I can get faster and faster with it (again, something they probably don't want to allow). then, there's the problem of -- if I have it, then other people will want it too, and I'll probably look pretty down upon the noobs still trying to type -- pfft what losers -- get the brain interface -- and they won't be able to tell me why they can't or don't have access. it's just a poo-poo-platter all around.

you see the nosebook technology is all 3-7 technology. its input/output is physical signals (7) and it transforms those signals into symbols (3). it's exactly the *opposite* of what I want to do. I don't want anything to do with their system.

---

my goal is to make a system that isn't interfacing with physical sensation, but with random/desire (1) and concept/emotion (5). it's a whole different type of technology and I believe that mine is actually superior -- though it'll have a much longer buildup because my system requires numbers (parallel users/minds/instances) rather than machine speed. it uses composition of diverse things (a noisy or chaotic signal) rather than a structured and static symbols. the other goal I have is to design the thing 100% externally (screes, phones, buttons, handheld devices), so that as things get faster, there is a barrier between the user and the machine and so, like the guy in the squirrel suit, it starts to become impossible for the physical body to be receiving the signals, and instead you get into the "zone" and interact with the system entirely in on abstract/conceptual level.

it's kinda difficult to explain the system in its entirety because I don't honestly have the full picture. I just sorta know where to start and how the 1 and 5 layers work pretty well, so I just implement a reflection of my own understanding of that.

so anyway, the sense that I had when I woke up is that these two systems would compete. obviously everything would work on the nosebook backbone (ie. they would still have their whole system in place) and I won't be trying to bring theirs down at all.

it'll be kind of like a competition, and I think that eventually, there *will* be more people that actually figure out how to feel the way they want to feel -- and I think those with experience will say that my system will feel more fun, compared to nosebook's more pleasureable feeling. we'll see though.

### 2022-06-12 14:19 - the parable of the weeds

as I've been pulling weeds, I've been thinking about the parable of the weeds (it comes right after the parable of the sower). in it, the enemy plants weeds and they begin to grow up amongst the wheat. the servants ask to master if they should pull up the weeds. he replies no, they're intermixed like the white-flowered vines where with the ugly wheat-looking grass. the inversion of these two symbols greatly reminded me of this parable, because this time it's the wheat that is ugly and unwanted, but the weeds are have white flowers and smell nice.

the master says don't pull the weeds because you'll damage the roots of the wheat so just let them grow together. then when it comes time for the harvest (of jehovih?), the weeds and wheat will be harvested together, the wheat kept (some yielding 30, some 60, and some 100 fold) -- but the weeds will be thrown into the fire.

I was completely "baffled" by this parable because I know after pulling weeds for a while now that if you let the weeds grow to full term, they spread so much seed, next year that whole field will be completely filled with weeds. I have no idea what the master is doing. it sounds like he's trying to grow weeds because the next year that field will be unplantable (though the weeds will return a lot of the nutrients to the field by letting it go fallow like that).

so I got to thinking more and more about this parable. it has so many interesting parallels, because I don't see weeds as this awful thing anymore. they're completely vibrationally dependent so they're much more conceptual, and their physical appearance will be a reflection of the vibration in their environment (just like a 5d person would). weeds also appear to grow in the most inhospitable places too.

I've also been thinking that weeds must be serving an electrical purpose too because very very often when I reach down to pull a weed, it gives me a static electricity shock meaning that I'm at a different electrical potential than the weed (and probably the ground around it) so they feel to me like plant amplifiers -- they are what I would call a 1st ray plant.. very chaotic -- they're making hybrids with everything they come into contact with (very much like me) and constantly reflecting the vibration of their environment so, they're clearly 5-1 plants to me.

wheat however is a cultivated plant, and according to sitchin, these plants and a lot of the other ones that appear in south america were designed by thoth (+7) identified by the natives as viracocha/quetzacoatl. they took existing plants and modified their ME so that they would serve the purpose of the inhabitants there, removing toxins, etc. (see "magicians of the gods" by graham hancock) I think enki (+-3-+) also did a lot of these plants too when they first arrived to sumer as well.

now whether you believe that story or the mainstream story that wheat is a steady process of genetic selection through years and years of breeding iteratons, the result is the same, wheat is clearly a 3-7 plant.

---

so what we're looking at in this parable is this weird thing where jesus basically foretells that later on there will be a time when the 5-1 and 3-7 types will grow up at the same time, and at the end of it all of the 5-1 types will be thrown into the fire.

I didn't really understand the fire part until this morning when I was thinking about the leapfrogging-time-pickles idea. in it, I stated that once the 5-1 guys have made it through to find our connection, we'll be able to reinsert ourselves back into the timeline wherever we want to. I figure there are two paths: one of good conditions (deired path) and one of fuzzing (undesirable path) where you continually try to defeat yourself by creating more and more difficult conditions and oppressions for yourself -- and you know because you take the 5-1 path, that those conditions and oppressions can never conquer you.

I stated that in order to continue on the 5-1 path, you have to going really really fast, much faster than your first time through ("end of time" for you), and then when you reach the end of time, you'll have to go down to the speed you were at in your "end of time". so if you're going 4000mph and you go down to 200mph, you didn't crash, but that's a tremendous deacceleration that has to be put for you to get back to the speed you had at your end of time, which means a lot of friction -- which means a lot of fire. fire doesn't mean complete destruction (shadrach, mishack, abednigo?, alalu, etc didn't completely vanish) -- fire never means the end -- it's just the rapid disentigration of the physical exterior so that the phoenix bird can rebirth into a new physical form (ie. baptism of fire).

so I didn't really think about it that way until this morning, but the whole baptism of fire that some of the christians want is for the weeds, not for the wheat. inotherwords, the 5-1 (fuzzing-time-pickles) are using the 3-7 (conditional-time-straighteners) to continually reach faster and faster speeds then let the crash to burn away the undesirable and desirable physical form so that they can be rebirth into something even more desirable.

like I said, whoever that master is trying to preserve his wheat crop is completly nuts. next year, his wheat field will look like our backyard where we let the weeds grow last year.

but who knows that'll probably inspire them to come up with a new even more powerful pesticide. go technology :)

### 2022-06-12 20:15 - more getting off into the weeds

after I left to go do more weeds, I remembered something I wrote in @[blahblog](2022-06-12 14:19) about weeds, being more 5-1, they seem to amplify the vibration that is present in the area -- and so probably what the whole "punishment" thing was nothing more than if those white flowers grew up out of good feeling are amplifying it, after pulling them, she may have to start over again. that whole starting over thing (great song, btw -- one of my favourites) is typical in the realm of chaos. it's more like start over as many times as necessary and eventually one of the times things will line up just right so it works out.

then later when I was thinking about this, it suddenly started to rain. I had noticed that paul had just washed his truck and it was all shiny right as I walked up too. as soon as I left, it stopped raining. I couldn't figure out why it rained, but I concluded it was probably to get the girl playing basketball to go inside. I have no reason why to think that, but she's loud and probably pretty 1st ray in nature, so that's probably perceived somehow as a problem. I dunno. just that's the conclusion I came to -- but let's just say I'm right. her desire matched with paul's desire (fear/memory of his truck getting rained on last time I showed up) and that created a reality where he got his truck rained on again. a *perfect* example of chaos becoming ordered by concept/emotion.

so then later I came home and I was talking with jaron about his shirt, giving him suggestions to make it more napoleon dynamite-like by ironing on an elementary school picture with the text "merry christmas" or something like that. I then launched off into talking about how I loved the shirt I made that said, "real men wear this shirt" and started to talk about how I modified where I wore that shirt because of all of the weird reactions that it gave. people didn't really know what to think about me because I didn't look like a guy that had something to prove (that I'm a "real man") but they did feel kinda frustrated at my apparent extroverted shirt but very geeky appearance. I was somewhere between confusing and enraging with that shirt on.

mom comes down somewhat hurriedly and so I start talking to her about the parable of the weeds -- but as usual, I say it differently depending on who I'm talking to. I said basically all the same thing as @[blahblog](2022-06-12 14:19) about the weeds, but my conclusion was different because I told her how I noticed that the weeds are a lot like the tuenti sales team where they would be just the perfect appearance for the meeting, but then walk outside and completely change appearances, cursing and rough talking. it was notable to me how dramatic the shift in their appearance is.

weeds can't walk, but if they could, I think they would be shapeshifters. they appear really unpredictable, but if one could figure out the vibrational variables which cause a weed to grow up one way vs another, a "landscape architect" could control the conditions of the places he plants the weeds, so they grow up to be the type of weed that he wants to have there.

anyway, so I was thinking about the sales people being very 5-1 (like weeds) in appearance, and I was noticing that I would describe most of the sales guys as 1st ray males. they knew how te desire something and then find a way to get whatever it was sold. they would optimise a lot of stuff about their appearance and presentation, so they reminded me a lot as 3-7's, but really when looking at it, they were 5-1's. I thought of paul.

remi came out to show me stuff, we talked about her cat, "lamar" -- and he didn't want to have anything to do with me. I was wondering if he associated me with the yellow cat. it was really weird how much he didn't like me. going back over to pull more weeds, I was thinking about how if they found a girl cat, they could name her "el mar" -- but then I realised that in french "el mer" is probably the same as spanish "la mar"[^2], so I went home to make sure and it is -- so I thought that was kind of a funny name for a duo, "elmer and lamar".

---

the other reaction that I had (not related to the previous stories) was when I was telling mom about how a weed will completely change its appearance based on circumstance, I noticed a strong reaction to it. I translated the reaction into a memory of when I was a child, often times mom would be yelling at us and the phone would ring and she would completely change her tone of voice, posture, every thing and answer the phone, "hello?" as if nothing had been happening. seems that this sort of conditionally appearance is attributed by a lot of people to be a feminine attribute, as there felt like there was some bitterness over the utilisation of desire and and manipulation of feelings.

all in all, I know for certain that 5-1 and 3-7 are opposite polarities of each other. you could say that whatever opposite polarity of you is doing the opposite -- because it's the same thing, just approached from oppsite directions.

to illustrate that, there were reactions to the kinds of 5-1 technology I was wanting to produce, because in @[blahblog](2022-06-12 13:31) I mentioned that it will input/output concept emotion just like nosebook's system input/output physical signals. well, obviously the most ideal thing to do would be to talk eventually to hp and ask them to produce memristor type technology with RLC circuits[^1] -- but that's eventually. for now, we'll just use random number generators (1) and plain old digital hardware. I really think it woould be very awesome to do something like the annunaki where we program our own MEs and use genetics instead of RLC circuits but you have to use what's available.

what I mean is, a fully 5-1 system isn't possible right off. the system needs a lot of 3-7 to get to where it's eventually going to go. just because I'm choosing the way I feel and influencing my computer with "random" -- I'm still producing something rigid. sure, it's be awesome to have the ability that the annunaki have to directly perceive, edit, and instantiate MEs, but that's not possible yet. I'm pretty sure that nosebook has lots of 5 stuff (they probably have those RLC arrays), but they probably try to get rid of as much 1 as possible and start from a 3 or 7 perspective. I prefer to start with 1 or 5 and then implement 7 or 3 as a reflection of that.

[1]: I don't understand. why is the RLC memristors such a reactionary topic? they must be pretty good.

[2]: reaction is telling me that "la-mar and le-mer" is funnier. I guess "el mer" sounds too terrible, lol

### 2022-06-13 16:38 - if things don't go smoothely

a weird thing happened where I made a card for dad for father's day (the one I bought after @[blahblog](2022-06-10 16:26)), and I signed it and everything but then it just disappeared according to mom.

I perceive time flowing both directions, so all of the possible futures are all happening and attracting the present based on the way that I (and everyone else) feels. so, that future happened. the card got to dad and he opened it up and he reacted to it. that future is then attracted by him in the present by feeling compatible with that reaction. if it were a compatible reaction to how he feels now, the card would have been sent smooothely -- but it wasn't.

so that means to me that either dad did not really want to attract that future or someone else didn't want dad to receive that card. or the other possibility that those with the ability to edit the timeline (the conditional-time-straighteners) noticed that the card made him or lily feel too good or maybe believe a little too much (the rock says "believe") and so they have to manipulate conditions to ensure that we're not going toward too good of a feeling future.

---

either way is equal to me, becauese when things just don't go smoothely, I tend to just cut my losses and move on. I'm not going to try and make it happen. for me those sorts of events happen for a reason, and so I just go with it. if I try to fight it, I'm trying to make something happen, and that's not very productive. what is productive is to just let the desire evolve and then I'll be inspired to send him something else some other time. when I get the inspiration to do it that means again that if I do it then, he'll receive it at a time when he's compatible with his future reaction.

I prefer to just let them fuzz away and try to find out all of the incompatbile reactions to try and prevent the future from feeling good. eventually, dad (or someone else capable of receiving something like that) will eventually recieve it. I really don't need to worry about any of that. I just follow my inspiration and if it doesn't work out easily and effortlessly, I just let it go. no big deal.

### 2022-06-14 14:30 - digital

I decided to try and replicate that one colour program in kotlin and libgdx for the mobile replicating the Unciv structure. pretty standard stuff and it shouldn't be too difficult at all, but as I was getting into programming, I notciced that just looking through github and stuff, different languages *felt* very different from each other. it's hard to describe this, but I wanted to try because I noticed all of a sudden I got a lot more objective oriented which means there is a lot of objective-motivation going on there (a week or so ago, I talked to mom about this while walking through the park with jaron).

I was strongly reminded of how I used to motivate myself previously. I don't think that it's anything detrimental to me, but being as sensitive as I am now, I noticed it very strongly. almost all of coding is very 3-7 oriented, and I was thinking about why that is outside, and so I wanted to relate some of my thoughts.

the nice thing about digital is that it doesn't change.
the undesirable thing about digital is that it doesn't change.

I noticed that code feels a certain way, and I was thinking about how the old code that I used to use feels, and there are some really good things that I like about it, but there are also a lot of really not so good feeling aspects about that code, too. I'm going to rewrite a lot of the ideas that I used to use in kotlin and see how that goes, and I think that will completely change how I feel about that code (deletes the bad-feeling parts).

however, I noticed too that some parts that I used to feel really good about now don't feel quite as good anymore, and that's not because the code has changed, but I've changed. if I were to go back and look at that code, it would tune me back to where I was when I wrote that code, and since I'm so different now, that's partly why it feels uncomfortable or bad. I actually think that my/our change through time is actually what produces more than 50% of "code rot" -- and it's not just dependencies getting outdated -- I think there is also a psychological and emotional aspect to code rot, as well.

in nature, there are so many cycles, everything is constantly changing, so nothing is ever exactly how it always was. code, however that has been sitting around for a while, is. a long time ago, I wanted to write this other type of program for building interfaces which I'll describe here. it's kinda not very well thought out, but here goes...

the idea is that you have lots and lots of "random" data streams coming in and those data streams are identified as something meaningful -- think like arduino inputs a hash of the last 10 urls your browser has loaded or whatever. these data streams correspond to some randomised sampling of data from the environment that is scrambled but meaningful.

these provide the *only* inputs to the application which is just a 2d set of pixels or voxels or some uniform space. then some sort of logic is used to turn those random data streams into visuals. the idea is that the display is always moving, so you could write code that takes certain random combinations of things and paints certain boxes when those inputs are noticed, but that's not very interesting. a box is just a box. the point is to try and do something interesting with the data -- transform it in some way and render it into the uniform space provided.

there was a second phase to this as well: I envisioned all of this rendering to be done by a bytecode system such that any one of the bytecodes performed an operation on the pixel/voxel space (think advanced BF[^1]) depending on the state of the registers/pointers and the random data stream coming in.

there could be any number of those BF units editing the space, but probably you'd want to have at least some BF unit removing pixels while the others are adding.

once the bytecode is well-formed, you'll get you a pretty stqble pattern. this will be done at first by hand programming the bytecode, but later, what I want is a second bytecode that outputs bytecode. that bytecode will then be fed back into the BF (which has the random inputs).

there is a fourth subsection that I don't really see right now, but the idea is that it performs some sort of feedback to the screen BF so that the input BF is constantly improving (and retains its base functionality). I honestly don't see this last subsection very well and it's always been the problem for creating this idea.

one of the other constraints of the BF bytecode is that there should be no reserved bytes (or maybe a series of them can be for detecting errors), but the idea is that the BF can be generated randomly -- meaning any random bytes (minus any reserved bytes) will be a valid program (though maybe not useful).

you can see that this system will eventually create a self-healing feedback mechanism so various of these systems can be put in series or in parallel to have a system which is constantly changing and resiliant to random mutations in its code.

I still want to think on this more. digital is a whole different world from my new perspective. :)

[1]: lol, I've been listening to snake-bros too much. instead of calling it "brain fart" I'll call it "butt flap"

### 2022-06-15 13:20 - tech path

after writing that last entry, I thought a *lot* about jon (from thekla). I used to watch a lot of his videos on jai and stuff. he has a lot of bytecode stuff already done. the other one I thought about was demitri from mass, which also has a very similar thing to what I'm looking for. the whole idea of working on some of this tech felt pretty good.

so then later on when night came around (maybe around 9-10pm my time) the idea stopped feeling nearly as good. at the very end, I introduced a lot of "practical" ideas into the mix like how I seem to do nothing other than produce ideas[^1], and that a real product has to be made that makes money and stuff. I've expanded the idea, so I'll probably make a second revision of it. so along with monetisation possibilities (which I think there are millions I'll revise the idea a bit further and focus it better). that's not the focus of this entry.

in the snake-bros ep I listened to (#089) they read a news story about how "neutron" radiation is higher in a flight (and also during a flare -- all the white dots hitting the coronagraph, but they didn't mention that), and I think that may be correlated with the phenomena I experience of the kundalini rising suring solar flares and geomagnetic storms. so a plane is higher neutrons, but not *that* much more. I wonder how similar a plane is to a normal flare -- because I seem to be doing pretty good now that I don't drink anymore coffee. I only get minor things but they seem to be associated with geomagnetic events now.

so, it's actually quite possible now that I don't drink coffee to take a plane flight. also, after having noticed how much solar activity was happening yesterday (baseline c-range, many m-flares), and the only thing I noticed visuals starting to appear in my eyes during a geomagnetic storm (probably an impact -- which was also a subject of the snake-bros and ezekiel). I think I may actually be able to go a year or two more at least. so I have time to spare again.

so, here's the thing: I want to go all the way until I'm connected, because I've been thinking about what it is that I *really* want, and girls are all really great and tech stuff is pretty cool, but I think that flight would probably be the thing that I want, so I want to keep powering up for that.

that means that I have time before I get connected and flight kicks in. so, I was thinking that I kinda actually do really like the idea of working on some tech until that happens.

the tech thing is also really cool because it's possible that the tech could be used to hold me out even further -- as in, it's my goal to not only work on 5-1 tech, but I also want to work on the party-LAN project, too -- and if that could provide a way for me to sell my energy to others, I could potentially hold that off for even longer than previously thought.

---

the advantages of that are so numerous to both sides: the people (cause I find it possible that party-LAN technology can be used to enable others to fly too, if they have enough power or can purchase it) and the network (cause I skip over the astral entirely), and nosebook (cause my vision keeps expanding so we can add more perceptible layers -- temporal and identity layers possible) -- so, it's pretty worthwhile, as I've realised through all of this time that the actual reward for my style of thinking is how effortless and nice everything is and how my vision keeps expanding. I really like living like this, and I'm sure that others would as well, so that's all good for me.

there are some dissenters saying that they need a manifestation in order to feel good, and don't want anything to do with what I'm doing -- and that's fine, cause it could happen a lot earlier anyway.

even if it was only delayed a year or two, I *still* think it's the better path, and those that don't can find a way to feel the way they want to feel. additionally, we know that it won't last "forever" because even if I didn't actually ever get my connection, the effect that I would have on others in my presence will be tremendous -- as in nearby to me, reality will start to reflect the feeling/concept of those around me very rapidly, and so eventually nosebook will be forced to get me off of the planet.

so if I just keep going, I'm looking at cool tech, flight, and probably getting put on to another planet. it all seems pretty awesome to me.

also, there's no real stopping me anyway from taking this path, because I can just keep self-sabotaging until what I want manifests.

[1]: which got me to notice that I have a lot of the qualities of the villians in the tick. one side of me could be seen as the breadmaster and also as the idea men -- and many others. seems I play both sides. these ideas tie into things I noticed about the triads in lbe and the 3/4 subsuctions of the previous idea.

### 2022-06-17 11:51 - magnetic fields and polarised light

yesterday I listened to snake-bros #091 - brian keating. I'd never heard of him and I was surprised to hear him explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) with the example of a microwave oven where microwaves heat up water in your food by exciting those molecules -- and then goes on to explain a whole bunch of really outlandish ideas about figuring out the first microsecond (and smaller) of the big bang -- when I thought that maybe he was going to correlate that water may have something to do with the big bang and the CMB. I hope he's seen dr. robitaille's presentation in the CMB. -- but anyway, that's not what I wanted to talk about.

he was explaining that his investigation involves the study of the polarisation of the light the CMB emits "right after the big bang" -- the theory being that the polarisation of the light present in the CMB is going to represent the primordial polarisation right after the big bang. kyle asks him to explain what polarisation was and I forget now what his explanation was, but he brought up magnets in it and how if you take a magnet and cut it in half you don't just get a north half and a south half -- but two smaller magnets. I found that explanation to be pretty confusing.

---

so, I thought I would write down how I see the EM field and give my explanation on polarised light.

I think of all magnets as a monopole -- so let's say that iron spins CW, so the N pole is coming *out* CW -- well, then the S pole is coming *in* CW also, and so when you have coming out CW next to coming in it experiences attraction. if it's coming out CW and it's next to a coming in CW, it experiences repulsion, much like two fans facing each other would repel each other, but a fan behind another fan will get pulled toward the first fan.

so then when iron is not magnetised all of the iron atoms are all facing random directions. however, when a large magnet influences all of those atoms to face the same direction, then iron becomes magnetised. that's ferro magnetism.

diamagntism is the exact opposite: imagine for a moment that iron spins CW and gold spins CCW -- when gold gets near to magnetised iron, then the spin is opposite, so experiences repulsion -- or diamagnetism.

finally, polarisation of light is just the orientation of the spin of the wave propagating through the medium. I would imagine that polarisers are essentially aligned magnets allowing only same direction rotating waves to pass through.

### 2022-06-17 14:14 - more on EM fields

after writing the last entry, I was reminded of a proposal that veritassium had about explaining a scientific concept in 2m or something like that. upload the video and put a hashtag or something. anyway, the idea is pretty good for a video like that. there are things that I haven't really thought about much with that idea because I don't really know how to approach it without experimentation...

first of all, I *assume* a medium because if a magnet is a monopole, and something is spinning in a direction, then the magnetic field is the movement of this medium -- just like in the example of the two fans as magnets, the magnetic field is the wind displacement. that's kinda kicking the can down the road because I don't really know how to explain the medium, but I think that the whole thing is a fractal, so the medium/ether is just higher frequency EM waves as well, so that medium too will have a medium -- hence the fractal. I don't think there's a smallest size and so a biger particle collider will just start to reveal artifacts of the medium of the ether (and so on).

the second thing I haven't given much thought to is, I say that gold (diamagnetic materials) simply rotate CCW, but I provide no explanation of why that's so, and we know about electromagnets, but those all produce normal magnetism, not diamagnetism, so I don't know yet how one would go about creating diaelectromagnet.

I may have figured out a small answer to my own question about diaelectromagnet, because right after that I was thinking about what I would tell people about why I'm missing teeth.

---

I started out by explaining that my girlfriend told me that flouride is bad for us so I stopped brushing my teeth. and so, whether it is bad or isn't, I can't really say, but I ate tons of it as a kid and nowadays, if I ingest some, it produces visuals in my imagination.

I then started to explain how if I were to ask someone to imagine a cat, they'll picture a cat in their mind and it'll probably look similar to whatever the most significant cat they know or have last seen. I don't see anything. it's black, but I *know* there's a cat there. I can feel the cat even though I can't see it.

so what happens for me is all of the words that most people associate with emotion (knowing, sensing, feeling), this is my "imagination" and it's how I perceive things *visually* (though there's no image to see). I process emotions visually, and I look at emotions and "see" abstract things that most people would normally associate with feeling.

so, to explain this in the reverse: if I talk about love or hate, these don't have any visuals associated for me; it's just a feeling. I can then manifest that feeling into an image and that image, though I don't see it has a lot of qualities of real life. it feels like I'm doing something -- like killing someone or destroying something, and that's the way that I manifest that concept into something visual.

if I were to talk to someone else about an abstract concept such getting a reward for doing something (or rewards in general), they would almost certainly feel a feeling and that feeling would feel like the reward (validation, love, acceptance, approval), and that feeling would be manfested into an image of receiving an symbol which represents that (award, sex, accepting/approving body language). I don't see those things so I just feel the emotion. I have to then translate that emotion into a thought...

OK, what I'm talking about is thought and emotion. thought and emotion are kind of like electromagnetism in that you can't have one without the other. I suppose that when you're in "alignment" the thought and the emotion are happening at the same time, but for most of us there is a delay between the two. when I think, an emotion nearly immediately follows (small delay). think of this in term of a AC waveform where current (emotion) trails voltage (thought). an strong impulse of one will produce a strong impulse of the other.

so the same is true -- I don't know how to do this in an experiment, but imagine you have a pulse of current -- well, wait until it goes all the way around (or see it as time flowing backwards), and you'll get a similar spike in voltage that follows the currunt in the reverse direction. I think of this reverse action acts as a sort of vacuum. the emotion that I feel creates a vacuum that then attracts a similar[^1] sort of thought.

so if I wanted to make a diaelectromagnet, I'd need to figure out how to to make it go the opposite direction -- as in voltage that follows current -- which is attraction.

maybe to explain this, I imagine electricity as the emission part -- the part where it's going out from its source, and the attractive or "night-side" is the other half of the emanation where it's returning back to its source. to illustrate, the stuff going out of the power station (or the sun) is electricity, and then there's a whole nother part where the electricity wants to go back to the source and so this is the stuff that flows out of the appliance and into the ground and into the planet. the power station is just creating a potential by doing some work, that's electricity, but then it gets transformed into opposite work in the appliance, and then ... hold on

I just can't quite get my head around it yet, so I'll just explain what I see. at first, it seemed to me like the electricity is just a potential at the station. every potential is created by either by rotating a lever (like a teeter-totter) or by doing work (pushing a swing), so I was seeing that the power station creates a potential by doing work which then goes out into the power lines to the appliance. the appliance then converts that potential back into work, so if work is flowing only one direction, you would think that you only need one wire. the thing is that the appliance is also doing work, and so that's also creating a potential as well, which then flows out of the appliance and into the earth.

I sill don't understand what I see there. anyway, after I saw it that I saw another picture where in this one, there was an ether around the sun, and there's another ether around the earth. the earth wants to get the sun's something (ether?) but the earth repels the sun's invasions, and so for the earth to receive the sun's stuff, it has to pass through the earth's atmospheric layers which protect itself. I can see that this is the original reason for the pyramids (Bond-Heaven-Earth) because they create a vertical pathway for that energy from the sun to get into the earth, and the earth likes this the plants and animals don't like zero atmosphere, so it's sort of a struggle.

for example: mercury, having virtually zero atmosphere, is a near perfect receiver of the sun's energy. however, as the planet starts to grow up, like a kids, it starts to separate itself from its parent and begins to grow an atmosphere to distinguish the way it feels (planet's ether) from the way the parent's feel (sun's ether). these are running at different speeds and so a planet with a lot of atmosphere has a lot of self-identity (very different from the sun)

these atmospheric planets like earth want to collect the sun's energy, but it also wants to maintain its self-identity, so it has to find a way to get the sun's energy down to the planet but also maintain the way that life on the planet wants to do things.

[1]: when I say similar, I mean, "similarly vibrating" so the thought and the emotion will have a harmonious frequency (they go the same way for most of the time) between them. that compliates the example though.

### 2022-06-17 15:23 - the tech path (thinking further)

that last entry was really good, because I learned a lot about planets and suns again, but that isn't what I wanted to talk about.

like I said, I was thinking about sending that my magnetism explanation to derek for the 2m explanation of an idea contest, but then I got to thinking about what it is that I really want for going the tech path.

that idea about explaining magnetism is all really good and I love how it works out, but I really have been wanting to work on the 5-1 technology so I've really been thinking about the BF-matrix idea. I really like the idea and I want to start getting it going more but I've been doing too much yardwork and listening to snake-bros.

the other thing about it is, while I do think it's a really good idea to try and start to figure out the various ways to look at electricity and magnetism, because it'll make the party-LAN idea go smoother, I still really want to eventually work on the party-LAN idea.

lately, since I've been doing more yard work, I've really come to miss the feeling of coming home after a day's work and knowing that I accomplished a lot, rather than just sit around and think up ideas and stuff. I love to theorise, but I really like to build things, so I was trying to figure out what sort of tech path I want to go.

I'll probably hem and haw around for a while because I don't know what I want to do. the thing I like about the party-LAN idea is that it's essentially a performance metric system. your body creates power and the more power you create, the more you can sell, so it has all of the 5-1 sales metrics feel to it. the more optimum you are the bigger the numbers. I don't imagine that many people will take my perceptual route, but that's totally fine.

OH, I just had an idea! you know how the annunaki were using gold (diamagnetic) to "heal" their atmosphere? well, it's probably because the diamagnetic nature of gold is the opposite spin of the sun, so therefore it'll repel the sun's rays a lot better, allowing for the atmosphere to repel the sun better. the pyramids that they had on nibiru/mars were making everything spin the same direction (like the light polarisers) so the pyramids were making the atmosphere rotationg the same way as the sun's rays, letting them through. the deluge probably happened because the repulsive effect of the planet was so great the sun, being the creator of a great potential its own energy couldn't return to its source, so it tries harder and harder to get its similarly vibrating energy through the atmosphere to the earth. too much of a frequency of energy built up and wanted to get to it's source...

so now, if we think of this party-LAN project, there will be a lot of energy available (created by us), but I think there will probably be a different quality of the energy that is created perceptually, because that energy will rotate CCW which is the same direction as gold and the emotional/conceptual ether rotates -- meaning, its utilisation will create the opposite. what I mean is the perceptual energy is probably useful in certain environments[^1].

remember that one book with the ice carls? I always imagined that the environment that the perceptual people create will be quite cold, but now I wonder if that's because it's opposite to the sun's rotation. it'd be interesting if different people in the party-LAN had auras that created cooler environment (probably conceptual imagination) vs others that created warmth in the environment (physical imagination). warmth is quite good as crops grow really well in warmth -- and it'd be really cool if various people created their own MEs to project out into their environment as well.

---

so I guess what I'm saying is I really like the idea of figuring out all of this stuff and communicating it well, but I also really want to build things and I really like the idea of doing the 5-1 sorta technologies too. I'm still trying to figure it all out (ie. follow my inspiration and then what's happening becomes apparent).

[1]: I've often wondered why in higher energetic moments due to perception, I feel *cold* rather than warmth, but then otther moments, my feet are totally burning up. this may be when my rotation is aligned to the sun (imagination?), rather than opposite the sun (emotion?)

### 2022-06-17 18:28 - conceptual imagination in the context of present reality

I went over to pull weeds at remi's house. I decided I was going to pull the weeds in the back, as I was opening the gate, I noticed a whole bunch of new goatheads that were growing. I decided I could start there and pick those. I then moved over to the grass, but along the way I was thinking about some of the reactions to my comments on the conceptual imagination.

what I have to say which answers so many of the questions is that *all* of us have a conceptual imagination and a physical (visual) imagination, but the difference between me and most others is my physical/visual imagination doesn't show up. like I've said before, drugs, flouride, and sex seems to open up my imagination and I start to see visual images -- other than that, I just see black. I have noticed others see an image inside of their head (their mind's eye), and that happens sometimes for me too, but it's not really very clear. I see all my images inside of my eyes -- as if I were looking right at it (for drugs, these are called "open eye visuals"), and they sperimpose theirself inside of my vision. if I were to teach myself to control it, I could conjure a motor and have it run or do whatever inventing in my mind, but the thing is, I don't really want that.

I like how I am now with a non-visual imagination because it gets me to focus on the feeling instead of the visuals. *everyone* has both, but usually people get consumed by the visuals -- and I would be no exception. if I had an imagination, I would spend all day there just like I used to do on drugs. it's a whole lot more fun to just think about creating something than to actually create something.

the few times that I could see with astral perception, I basically just walked around with my mouth hanging open and especially daniel thougtht that was annoying. I just kept saying how beautiful everything is.

that was back when I was much more conditional and so I liked the idea of everything being beautiful because that would make me feel good. nowadays, I don't think that way. most of what you see is an illusion. everyone is trying to make visual communications that appear a certain way -- but I find all of that to be worthless. I like my world where I just feel instead of see. by only feeling, I don't see the illusion.

---

going back to picking weeds, I was explaining that the reason why I'm not actually interested in a girlfriend or anything that's actually really attractive (I talked about this in the context of patricia and venus) is because I don't like the idea of constantly being pulled by someone visually. I have enough of a difficulty being pulled by someone emotionally, I just don't like the idea of being around really hot girls -- and if I can, I prefer to be around them where I'm basically blind. visually pleasing to me isn't something that I want too much of. I like functionality. I like actual productivity and stuff like that than the illusion of beauty.

so it's obvious why I dislike the idea of being stuck with girls. sure it sounds good, but I'd prefer to keep my distance, especially from the beautiful ones. then, after paul left with the girls, there was a feeling like "girls should just be pretty but men are going to do all of the *real* work" -- and so I was trying to figure out the feeling, because it probably had something to do with paul.

I looked into it and I noticed that I keep trying to go toward doing something like a project or more than one project -- and the sense that I get is that for eva paul wanted her to be really beautiful and so therefore from eva's perspective she's looking for someone that can appreciate her visually -- which is definitely not me -- so that's what she has to look for. allie feels to me like an accident, and so to some extent she doesn't ever feel desired like eva was, so she was always perceived as dumb and an annoyance -- again, not for me, because I'm looking for girls that are *not hot* (or maybe a little is fine -- but it's not their defining quality) and can do *real work* -- and I don't mean like the highy-motivated men do (which is fixing things that are broken or don't like), I mean actually creating things that are desired.

girls unfortunately don't usually know what they want, other than to be pretty and to feel some sort of pleasure in being valued -- to be quite honest, I still haven't figured this one out, but it feels to me like they constantly need good conditions in order to feel good. again, I'm not interested in that. I'm interested in those that actually can find a way to feel good for no other reason than they want to. andrea was like this when I knew her, but she's probably not really like that now.

anyway, I don't really mind what others want to do. they're welcome to desire beauty and vanity all they want. I'm just not interested in that. antoher thing is, when I/we get to 5d, it's not going to matter what any of us look like, because you could be stunning visually, but if you feel terrible, I'll see you how you feel, rather than how you look anyway. visuals mean very little to me. I prefer not to have them.

---

in some ways, I remind myself of those arabs that blame beautiful girls for their "sin" and force them to wear a hajib. I definitely don't want to tell anyone what to do or not to do, so I'm not really like that -- just I'm saying that I would *prefer* not to have a visual imagination, and prefer to continue to have a conceptual one. if I wanted to see pictures, I'd eat flouride toothpaste. instead, I stay away from visuals, and like I said, sex is kinda one of those things that turns on my imagination -- so I prefer to get to 5d, so I see you how you feel and/or how I want to see you. there's *no way* I want to get stuck in the miserable world of imagination and beauty like you guys are all stuck in.

### 2022-06-17 21:33 - why so much emphasis on beauty?

one of the reactions is wondering if I'm saying that I don't want girls to be pretty.. well, I can't really say one way or another -- but you can feel that behind that phrase there is a bit of desparation wondering, "if we're not beautiful, then how will we get what we want?" -- as if beauty were the *only* thing that women are capable of doing.

if I were to say, "I want girls to be pretty", then that's what I value them for. I might as well say "you're nice as a decoration", and I don't think I'm saying that I want them to be ugly either, because ugliness is can be a visual indicator of self-loathing (the same with beauty). if I hate myself, I either want people to look at my outward appearance (beautiful or ugly) so that they don't notice how I feel about myself. it's often times an illusion to divert attention away from what's underneith. you'll see people that are very hurt be very ugly (usually acting very nice) because they don't want people to recognise how wounded and invalid they feel theirself to be. beauty is the same way -- if I can just get you to look at my perfect tits and ass, then you won't notice how awful of a person I am -- etc. (it's the same thing)

---

another thing that I just don't understand is why men who have been hurt by women (remember it's all attraction) will often times want their daughters to be really pretty, so they can then rely on their beauty to try and get what they want. it just doesn't make any sense to me.

---

so if beauty is an external reflection of how one feels about theirself, I've noticed that often times girls that their fathers expect them to be beautiful tend to feel better about theirselves and so therefore tend to be more beautiful, but they also grow up with the idea that men are the source of their beauty, too. many of them need the next guy who's not their father to see her as beautiful so she can keep getting beautiful.

there's another interesting thing that I don't really know how to quantify too, but it's common that married men tend to no longer see their wife as beautful after some time too, so now she's usually left with no way to continue her only value which is to be beautiful, and some seek other men to try and fill in that "I want others to see me as beautiful" void.

there's also a weird thing too where some prostitutes are extremely beautiful and others are really ugly -- and I think this has a lot to do with self-value, as well. I postulate that the beautiful ones are able to find clients that see them as beautiful and so continue that on, but the ones that are ugly are in a self-perpetuating feedback loop.

again, like I said, I don't really know how to quantify it, so I just let it be the way it is.

---

personally, I don't really care if someone is out looking for someone to see them as beautiful, because that's their excuse to feel good about theirselves.

beauty, in itself isn't bad. if it's acquired through one's own self-perception, that's amazing. I have no problem with that because that means that person is much more than just their exterior. they're beautiful inside and out. however, if a person needs someone or something else to be beautiful, that *usually* a sign that they're not so beautiful on their own self-perception.

---

I get a lot of reactions to why I conjure myself to look at so often when my imagination works, and it's because when I feel good (usually this is the state I'm in when my imagination works), I want to see what I look like. I don't usually shy away from my own self-perception. I rarely look in a mirror and think to myself, "wow, I look magestic!!" or "I'm really captivated by the way I look" but this happens every single time that I conjure myself in my imagination. I've never had my presence last for more than a few seconds, but I imagine that I'm also pretty knowledgeable, too.

I'm still working on getting this human body up to speed with that guy that looks like me in my imagination, but I imagine when I figure out how to feel like that guy does, I AM that guy.

---

if I were to give a recommendation to others (I'm a living example of it), I would recommend not trying to be either beautiful or ugly. I would just be as normal and natural as I could be, doing things that interest me and feeling the way I want to feel. that serenity, really is the ultimate serenity, because nothing really needs to change -- I don't need to be anything else for anyone else -- I just AM.

### 2022-06-20 15:19 - attitude vs conceptualisation

yesterday I talked with dad about a lot of stuff, but one of the topics that I covered (near to the end) was about attitude vs conceptualisation.

I was trying to explain to dad that once I realised that it's ALL attraction, I began to take full responsibility for my reality. *it doesn't matter how I got here* (cause I'm here and I can't change that), so now everything around me is a reflction of my conceptualisation of reality.

he brought up the example of (forgot his name) in the concentration camps, and said that attitude is everything. I agreed that attitude does have a large effect on reality, but conceptualisation is every more effective than attitude.

to understand this, imagine a person that is annoying. usually when I find people annoying it's because I don't feel good or I was already annoyed by something else -- but let's say that wasn't the case. I was in the middle of feeling really good (like I'm at the spa or some nice event) and they come up and they're really annoying still. attitude doesn't really help in that situation because I already find them annoying. I can try to do the "I'm stronger than this" or try self-deception, "they're not bothering me" -- but that will likely *still* not work to well. they'll still be annoying and they'll probably wreck the whole rest of the day for you.

---

conceptualisation is the identification of things and feelings as concepts. so you look out into the world and there are a bunch of concepts out there. you see some people trying to be helpful, all sorts of different definitions of people and things. these things interact, and when they interact, they become symbols or archetypes in your mind, and that's what creates the expectation of their future annoying behaviour. you *know* that whenever a person like *that* comes up in that way, it's going to be annoying.

whatever happens, you can almost always trace back the expectation for that thing happening, and whatever that is that caused you to expect it, is the conceptualisation. perhaps you believe that somebody on the LA freeway is inevitably going to cut you off on your drive to work because it's always happened before and so obviously you expect it to keep happening. attitude doesn't really change those expectations -- they just inspire you to push through it and try not to let it bother you too much.

---

changing conceptualisations is pretty easy but we don't really do it because we don't really want to let the other person off of the hook. the idea that people are doing things to me, is already a victim concept of reality.

changing conceptualisations is easiest when everything is attracted. I know that because I think they're a hurt and whatever person, they'll behave like my version of that archetype behaves, and so naturally, that is what I expect from them, duh.

so really, all there is to it is just finding a way to give others a little more space. things like, "well, they're figuring it out" or "sorry, I totally expected that" or maybe, "seems like the natural response from someone like that" or "yep, that's about right" -- stuff like that, just to affirm to yourself that you *were right about them* and so that's exactly how it turned out.

---

earlier on in my childhood, I tried to figure out how to predict everything that was going to be happening in my life, and I started to get pretty good that almost everything I expected turned out how I expected it to. this caused problems and I shut that down because I was quite the pessimist.

I later figured out that even though I shut it down for others, I still had those same expectations for myself. for a while, I found myself completely justified in how I felt. I had all of the exact reasons that would cause a person to feel the way I do, and so it was obvious that's how I should feel considering what happened to me.

it took a while before I started to want to feel good and wanted to start to expect good things to happen to me. I had to overcome a lot of things because what if I couldn't meet my own expectations and cause myself disappointment -- stuff like that, so I took a step back from the *doing* aspect of expectations, and made my expectations about how I can feel.

"I can find a way to feel good about this. it's still wrong and I hate it, but I can just allow it to be without needing it to change" -- stuff like that.

there are at least 3-8 different times where I "fell off the horse again" on that, and it took me a while to get back to believing that everything in my present is attracted by me. it's hard and it can take some practise. *it gets easier each time though*, which is probably the best attitude to have.

attitude feels to me like "self-should-feel" (but more motive).

### 2022-06-20 20:46 - conceptualisation and opposites

after writing the last one there were a number of reactions in the form of memories where someone expected something to be one way and it turned out the opposite. I've had the same thing happen to me, so this time I'd like to talk about attracting opposites.

I've said for a while now that unwanted-and-wanted-are-same. the reason for this is the perspective, so instead of rehashing that, I'll try and put this into a different perspective. we think of unwanted and wanted as synonymous with bad and good, but they are very distant. many things that would appear to be bad are actually wanted. my life is full of these examples so I won't belabour the point there.

when I started to learn about conceptualisation, I noticed that a concept had an association with good or bad, and I had to get rid of that association pretty quickly because I was finding that both bad and good can be unwanted (or wanted), so it's not really the goodness or the badness of it, but rather how wanted it is.

try convincing yourself that a bad concept is really a good concept. it's pretty difficult. now try turning an unwanted thing into a wanted thing. see how much easier it is? it's easier because *everything*, even the "bad" stuff, can turn into something wanted. this is so because everything vibrates, so naturally it has both polarities to it.

---

now, let's look at expectation in the context of trying to change something by expecting it to be different.

    you can't conceptualise something to be different than how it already is. you *can* conceptualise it so that causes a different reaction in you, though.

usually the concepts out in the world aren't going to be changing, so don't really try to change them, cause it's fruitless. you can't really force anything to be different. instead you can change how you feel about those things so you attract something different next time. or, you can change how you feel about it so that whatever it is no longer bothers you.

as you can imagine, this takes practise. we're usually pretty valid in our reasons for why we feel a certain way, but it takes practise to choose to redefine the thing in your mind so that you can feel good, instead. (it usually means letting them off of the hook for whatever it is)

in short, this process won't go very far if you don't want to feel good. the better you feel, the more rapidly those conditions will change, though you'll want to feel better for your sake rather than to try and change the circumstances. the way you feel is what you're attracting.

---

now let's take an example of something turning out different than expected. in my own life I've noticed there are a few main situations going on when this is happening.

the first and most obvious is that that I don't actually believe/expect it -- I just kinda hope or want it, but I don't actually think that something that good can actually happen to me.

the second and most common for me (there may be more) is that I don't actually feel as good as I thought I did, or there are still some triggers that can cause me to feel bad, so I'm not really very steady at feeling the way I want to feel. so then, because feeling bad (going away from wanted) and feeling good (going toward wanted) are basically the same thing, just looked at from opposite directions, it's pretty easy for them to flip-flop.

I just started to pay attention (literally while typing this) that feeling unwanted and feeling wanted have a totally different feel to me, and so again, if I look at something "bad" that's happening, I can always find a wanted aspect to it.

I have some reactions disagreeing with me. for example, just imagine how good it'll feel to be feeling good around a bunch a of bad-feeling people. imagine you're a "court jester" and you just get to run around making jokes all the time while everyone else is really hard at work feeling terrible. or, imagine you're stuck with someone who doesn't want to feel good, ever -- so then just imagine how much fun it would be to have things working out for you all the time and things constantly running smoothely because you feel good while the other guy has consant car trouble and difficulties all of the time. I don't want to be mean, but it's honestly pretty funny to watch others get really bent out of shape endlessly over conditions. I suppose I could feel bad for them, but I know that *it's all attraction*. that's a pretty wanted aspect to a situation.

I personally love this sort of stuff because I get to jump into a bad-feeling situation and make a bunch of jokes and prove that it's all not a very big deal and everyone is taking everything wayy too seriously. just have fun and enjoy their pity and self-loathing with them if that's fun to you and then come back to being who you are. no big deal.

### 2022-06-21 04:07 - solstice update

about an hour ago I laid down to see if I could experience the solstice energy. I've felt equinox energy very strongly but I've never felt solstice energy before, so this was a first.

I felt the kundalini rising energy in my feet and also in my entire chest area, but this time it was much softer than ever previous (even with the solar/geomagnetic events). I feel really good about that, and I can imagine that some time in the future it'll feel so good and normal that I'll essentially forget to stop it, kinda like peeing the bed dreams I had when I was little -- I knew what was happening, but I was too tired and it felt too good to stop it from happening (lol).

also I had a sense of weightlessness come over my body and a really light feeling that was quite nice. same thing as before, a large improvment over previous when it felt like it was rising really really fast and it felt like if I let it keep going, it would be painful. this rose very gradually and even was a bit of a pleasant sensation.

so all really good stuff there.

---

previous to this, I was thinking a lot about the previous entries on conceptualisation, because it felt to me like a lot of people think that I'll sabotage forever. as I mentioned in @[metal-lucifer](2022-06-18 22:18), I don't think it's possible to self-sabotage *forever*, as I belive that there are eventual physical limits that are reached, however in that one I did explore the idea that it's possible that the goal of all of this is to make nearly instant manifestation of ideas into the physical realm possible and also normal.

the overwhelming sense that I have is that this whole exercise in yielding is trying out the opposite end of the spectrum. what I mean is, first, there are a lot of institutions that kinda *need* a cataclysm. they simply cannot keep operating the way they're operating now. these institutions are founded on a lot of ideas (like keeping secrets) that don't really stand the test of time.

I think in the past, the institutions based on these secrets and things need a level of secrecy to continue to operate, but in order to keep a secret, they have to keep the people ignorant. that ignorance eventually manifests itself as codependence on a structure that is interested only in its own well-being. this causes an inequality and out of that inequality, dissatisfaction grows because most people are conditional about things[^1].

I'm not trying to get rid of the instituions at all. they're all fine. instead, I'm only trying to illustrate that they can have all of their conditions and stuff, but it's not necessary to feel dissatisfaction over anything that anyone else is doing, no matter how powerful they are.

what this turns out in reality is an extension of time for them. since I don't want to do anything to destroy their setup, they'll continue on with their setup for as long as it can keep going. normally, you would try to destroy something unwanted, but I say there's no need to destroy it -- just let them figure out how to keep it going for an extended period of time.

when I say extended, the context of the rate of change should be taken into account. a year today is not the same at all as a year 12kya. a year today has so much more going on with it. so, for example we have the dyanstic egyptians lasting nearly 4ky, but just try and imagine to yourself what the USA will look like in 30y from now. what about 50? these empires are not even comparable.

to make a more applicable example, let's compare the USA to the roman empire. I'll round the duration of the empire to 400y (after that it split), and so even though our years contain a lot more stuff happening than theirs, let's say that some magical force came down from the sky and magically gave rome all the capability to hold on to power by ensuring that nobody attacked them and unlimited resources.

under these circumstances, how long do you think the roman empire would actually last? it's an interesting thought experiment, because they had so much internal conflict, I would give it only about 500y or so. honestly, if I had a time machine, I would totally love to try that experiment and see how long it would last. what would it transform into? would it just endlessly change hands from one emperor to the next?

---

another example of this is the idea of pushing things too far is something that abraham always bothered my thoughts with when they would say, "soon we'll be having demanifestation workshops" -- and it got me thinkng about this a lot, because for a similar thought experiment, what if there was a way to make nearly instant manifestation of anyone's desires?

as I began to figure out how the conceptual realm works, I began to imagine a device kinda like a 3d printer where anyone could design things in their imagination (including living beings and organisms) and then walk over to the machine and get the thing out (I brainstormed this idea with jaron outside with the green lantern rechargable ring). a person could output a new girl/boyfriend for theirself every time they got bored of the last one, or make whatever thing show up in real life. you could design new technology as fast as your mind could think of it, etc.

you would think that an idea like this would want to have a limited release until they're going through some sort of approval proccess to ensure that people aren't printing weapons and killing others, I suppose -- but then, why not? what would happen to people in that situation?

there would be a whole lot of stuff, so someone will have to design something to recycle all of that crap -- or maybe launch it into space and create a new planet from the discarded desires of the human race.

see what I mean about this plan to just let them have all of their secrets and all of that stuff? I honstly want to see what'll happen if something like this were possible.

think about how crazy that would be! I guarantee it won't solve the dissatisfaction problem.

anyway, I still want to push this to its limit, and go for unlimited awesome, no cataclysm setup and see what they do with their institutional structure.

[1]: to say it another way: from their perspective, the dissatisfied people that they have power over are just a reflection of their dissatisfaction. everything under that heierarchy will tend toward dissatisfaction *by default*.

### 2022-06-22 12:27 - shakespere and stuff

yesterday I listened to grimerica #209 - alan green, where he gave his life story and how he came to look at the shakespere stuff. it was a really cool listen. he goes pretty deep into the backstory to illuminate all of the synchros, and that's actually what made it cool. I'd heard almost all of the other stuff before in various other presentations by him, anyway.

below, I have this section that I was going to write on 54 and the lunar eclipse that happened on may 15-16th 2022. when looking at those dates, I noticed that between april 4th and may 28th, there are 54 days, and those appeared to me in sections of 3x18 (3x3x6).

first of all, right before I listened to that episode, I looked right at that note to write that section, noticed that it was outdated and figured I probably wouldn't write about it. so as alan is telling his story, he talked about how his presentation that he gave was on the 10th of april and that stuck out at me. because it's 6 days after april 4th.

---

later on when going to sleep, I decided to figure out what the distances were between the various dates, and I noticed something wierd again because the sonnet that he played his alter presentation to was sonnet 18, and in it I remembered the line:

    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

turns out there are 27 days between april 4th and may 1st, then 27 more days till may 28, then 27 more days till his magical 24th of june day.

- 04-04
  - 04-10
  - 04-16
  - 04-22
  - 04-28 (+3)
- 05-01 (27)
  - 05-04
  - 05-10
  - 05-16
  - 05-22
- 05-28 (54)
  - 06-03
  - 06-09
  - 06-15
  - 06-21 (+3)
- 06-24 (81)

I thought that was weird and went to sleep on it. anyway, I noticed that the there are 6s and 9s, 12s, 18s and 27s, and I can't really see the image very well in my mind but it seems to me like there's there's a progression there, but I can't see it.

the other thing that he was talking about how 153 is a pyramid number, so 1+2+3...17=153, but there are two pyramidians on the pyramid there and they're both talking about this cupid guy, and have the word "bath" in them. I'd heard about the "bath sonnets" before and I thought I wrote something about it... I remember having done so, but it turns out there is only a reference in @[noseblog](2021-05-04 16:21) (a very interesting read in this context[^1]) to 06-24 being the birthdate of john the baptist.

alan talks about how one of the sonnets (only skimmed them last night and don't remember them) is about fire baptism and the other about water baptism. in the interview he talks about how here there are two Is on the top of the pyramid, but that eye is like the pineal, "when thy eyes become single thy body will be filled with light" (something like that). even the sirians talk about the conflict of the second ray (which I've identified as the rebirthing fire bird) has with the 3rd ray (which I've identified as aquarius, the water bringer). so john the (water) baptist is supposedly born on 6-24... I wonder if john has a son -- a johnson[^1].

anyway, this is partitcularly pertinent to me because I've been carrying on for a while now that that I want to go the 1-2-7 route, but clearly that has to be balanced there with the 3rd ray (water) stuff.

well, 3rd ray water stuff is the *technological* and physical implementation of something in the form of mentation and compartmentalisation in the form of what I've been calling 3-7 creation.

---

somehow all of these items kinda fit together in my head, but I don't honestly see it yet. the feeling I have is that in order to make a proper placenta, I want to probably focus on 3-7 (water) stuff for a while. I'm not at all against it. it is true that I do tend to lean a lot more heavily toward the perceptual than the physical, so we'll see what this starts to produce.

I feel like something new has started to open, but I totally can't see it very well at all. I'll probably have a look at the bath sonnets a little bit in the meantime.

[1]: I'm analysing a play by ben jonson, called magnetic woman (I think), and in it there is a lady lodestone (magnetic woman) and a mr compass who is quite a good reference point for the women. anyway, the magnetic woman is trying to get her neice married to all of these buffoons, the most significant of them is mothman. I thought this was originally a reference to "storing your treasures (on earth) where moths and rust can destroy them" but in the context of the tick, this is pretty close reference to carmelita (which also reads as "little brown" -- another section of the sonnets), making the magnetic woman mr vatos(??? I dunno). anyway, in the context of sanke-bros, "jonson" is the generic word for a failure[^2] and I'm talking about producing my tragedy in that one by building a feminocentric structure that's designed to go away after some time -- like a placenta.

[2]: cept that archer points out that a "johanson block" is actually this really cool herwmetically sealed precision thing in an episode I haven't got to yet (#117, I believe).

### 2022-06-23 11:34 - the logistics of it

a few days ago I finally typed out the 1000y-bloom idea, and I still have a lot more to go on it, but the basic idea is out there. there will probably be some neutral zones, but the way I outline it, the majority of the population (nearly everyone except for the lucifers, ie fuzzing-time-pickles) will be experiencing dissatisfaction.

I believe that the population of this earth -- that is those incarnated into bodies here have been filtered throughout the ages to be the ones that cannot find a way to be satisfied even with good conditions.

these unconditionally dissatisfied people are precisely the ones I'm looking for because no matter what, they're going to keep "putting more in the vortex" (as abraham says it). for every unit of unwanted/bad/dissatisfaction felt, they put in an equal amount of wanted/good/satisfaction, so all of these people are "instrumental" in creating something big. all they have to do is to feel tons of dissatisfaction and then someone else (that's me and who wants to join) can look at all of that unwanted/bad/dissatisfaction the opposite direction.

so I predict that 99.999% of adults will be quite dissatisfied even though many of them may have good conditions. this is intentional.

so go ahead and follow your dissatisfaction; it's actually what's wanted.

it's possible that they may remain dissatisfied even with the new thing that's created -- and that's totally fine too. there's no problem with any of that because they'll be the ones that create the next new thing.

I understand that this is kinda bifricating the population (dividing the path you might say) into two groups: those perpetually dissatisfied with the new creation and those satisfied with whatever and constantly improving the new creation.

---

the other thing that I woke up with a reaction to was [my notes on venus and adonis](/shakespere/venus-and-adonis.md).many of the sonnets and many of the lines that venus tries to use to seduce adonis are all rooted in preservation or continuation of something that's deteriorating and decaying (beauty, youth, etc), and so therefore because this is deteriorating, one needs to make an heir -- a memory of oneself so that one can continue to live on through the heir. besides the fact that it sounds a lot like the "fallen-angels" idea, I don't actually believe in this idea of perpetuating a memory or a legacy of oneself.

personally, I believe in the death and rebirth idea. I *want* to die so that I can be reborn into the improvement. I haven't really got to this explanation yet because I wanted a break, but the alpha is the 7th ray and the omega is the 1st ray (destroyer and creator of the new).

so, in this case, venus is clearly the omega and mars is the alpha, so it fits in perfectly that venus will destroy the old and create the new one. I believe in the story venus is doing something similar to don quixote where in that one chivalry was killed. my instinct says that it has to do with something similar -- the idea of having a saviour cause venus wanted to be saved by adonis, but he refuses so the sun keeps getting hotter. mars started the idea of war and smoothe-talking being the way to get what's wanted, but adonis taught mars how to have fun and stuff, so that's what the point is there. I'm probably off on that so I'll have to see how the story develops, but either way, the whole point is the death and the rebirth.

it's probably framed in the story that adonis' death is a terrible thing, but I claim that's precisely the goal. we only see the death here and think that's the end, but when you're an eternal being, it's hardly the end, and instead more like the beginning.

because of what I stated in @[metal-lucifer](2022-06-19 00:00) about how I believe this eventually going to lead to the death and rebirth of the universe, the 1000y-bloom is just the extension of that, so the goal of that is the death and rebirth of mars+adonis. each new concept in the death and rebirth cycle grows up for a time until it grows enough dissatisfaction and a need for preservation, then it's destroyed and comes into something new.

so, think of me kind of like that in that I don't mind joking and playing around and stuff -- that's all well and good for me, but the new concept now isn't to dance, joke, and play (actions) -- but instead to *feel* the way one wants to without needing the action to feel that way.

like adonis, the goal is for my own misconceptions of this new concept to eventually kill me so that I can be reborn. each time that happens, I can come back with the improvement that I couldn't quite get the last time because I still hung on to outdated ideas.

if the universe was created the way that kuthumi said it was created, the universe was created and had a lifetime something similar to vere's. he started out with all of these perfect conditions, but someone came in and sowed a bunch of tares into the perfectly cultivated field of wheat. it sounds like they found a way to isolate the tares (INFECTED ONES) to this galaxy and continue on cultivating wheat elsewhere in the universe, but the problem here with the tares is getting so far out of control, that eventually a complete death will eventually happen.

you can look at the trajectory of a life of someone alive as going toward more and more unwanted and dissatisfaction as they get older and more decrepit. beauty and youth are fleeting and need to be "used" before they go away -- because eventually all of that unwanted will eventually consume the whole creation (the whole body) and becomes pure unwanted. that unwanted body gets left behind and transitions into the opposite phase where the emphasis goes back to pure wanted. this is the devachan/heaven experience and then the body eventually gets reborn again. I believe the universe does somethting similar.

so, in that sense, I would imagine that the the process of the death and rebirth of the universe is the same as the deterioration of the physical body. unwanted and dissatisfaction will continue to increase until finally the body can no longer survive that quantity of dissatisfaction.

[ironically, the song "dogma - land of utopia" was on for the entire last 35m of that entry. I just noticed the title. kinda funny.]

### 2022-06-29 16:26 - visuals and astral

last night I wrote quite a ramble (@[blahblog](2022-06-29 00:54)), and there are some things that I'd like to respond to. they are seemingly contradictory, but you'll see that they aren't at the end.

when I talk about hot girls and the visual aspect being not important and even kinda annoying to me is because I have a really difficult time with anything visual. it's become increasingly more clear the more I live that I *do not* see things like others see them, and this creates a lot of conflict.

if a guy sees a hot girl, it's often the case that she inspires him (robert sepehr talks about this a lot), and so what is usually the case is that a woman's beauty *motivates* a guy to take an action. I completely reject this.

I just do what I want to do, and often times my desire resonates with other people's desire. for example, last night after working, I was going to program in kotlin, but I really wanted to listen to snake-bros -- so I heard scottie baldwin. I was going to write about the randall related reactions after the shower but it went away really quickly. I then really wanted to listen to seriah... laying there, I wanted to start writing and I noticed that the pigs sounding metal reminded me of the legion of demons, angels and lucifer stuff so I started to write about that. that morphed into a lot of synchronicities and other stuff so I just kept going with it. I had a very enjoyable time.

a few times during the night, I felt "wow, she's hot so I should do ..." and every time I stopped myself because I don't like that kind of motivation. I like to follow my inspiration.

another example of my difficulties with the visual aspect is like I said, I described eva as really tall and very hot high school girl cause that's how she appeared to me. I have no idea if she's really that tall, and I can't describe why she felt like a high schooler to me either -- just that's the sense that I get. I *see* the things that I feel from a person.

another example is later remi came out to talk to me and she had glasses on, and I noticed that she was looking a lot more attractive and vibrant than normal. however, when I brought up the conversation about the weeds, she suddenly lost all of her attractiveness and she looked upset to me. I have no way of knowing what she *actually* looks like, because I don't think her physical form actually transformed in those few seconds, but who knows -- maybe she's a shapeshifter too.

all in all, the visual aspect is very confusing and difficult for me to reason about. when I see a girl that's hot, I can't do anything with that. I can give her a high-five and tell her she looks nice, but that's as far as I go. I tried to figure out a subject in common with remi that doesn't involve sport because I don't really know how to deal with sport either.

I got a lot of ideas listening to scottie because I realised I shouldn't try and bring that out of her -- I find things curious, and I could try to figure out how to work my audience by figuring out their demographics (like I was attempting with remi), OR -- I could just be like the snake-bros and just talk about what I want to talk about, and the people who join me in the party are my audience.

this is what I used to do in spain really, which is why I drank alone so much and all of my "friends" were the people that would listen to me in the bars.

---

in contrary to what I just said above, you'll also notice from yesterday that I exhibit exceptional jeortau (2nd ray) qualities, where I take in astral (physical and conceptual) and I output it again as something relatable (desire and structure). I have a pretty brilliant balance between my desire and logic that I was noticing as a reaction to the part where I said I don't have any "hyper competency"

that process of turning astral into desire and logic/structure is what I've been doing with randall. he talks about the new earth and its furlongs in the form of desire. I recognise this because he conveys the entire presentation, presenting mostly on the astral plane (hence russ' supposition that being around randall is like being around a master or enlightened being -- don't remember the quote) and so because I can't "see" the geology porn[^1] he's pumping out, I feel what he's saying and that creates a picture in my mind that I can't "see" yet -- but it's there -- and then after some time of processing its aspects, I can turn it into something I can convey with logic and structure.

this process of turning astral into structure and desire was what chris really liked me for. he would draw pictures and convey feelings and concepts that I could then turn into structure and desire. this usually resulted in another song because he too is a visual musican. same thing with randall, I figured out how to get him to produce the thing that he wanted to make by giving him bad ideas (to inspire him (when you know what you don't want, you know what you do want)) and also good ideas -- some of which he also didn't think were that good, but it didn't matter because he's doing the production, so I stopped telling him me ideas are better than he thought they were.

this process of learning how to turn astral into something relational came in really handy when I got to spain to work on tuenti. when I was just converting imagination into something structured, it worked out really well, but when the imagination got clouded by all of the meetings, it was the end of that. I knew it was over when felix had his imagination for coca-cola, I turned it into structure ando and we (mostly dani) turned it into reality -- I knew that my time was done. like with chris, I'm not going to try and tell him that my idea is better than it is. I found that with chris, the reason why he didn't like my idea is because it was at a different frequency than the one that's in his imagination -- so I got better at "seeing" what he saw -- empathy, essentially.

---

now, it may seem like those two subjects are contradictary, but they're not. I've paid a lot of attention over the years to figure out why sometimes the image gets turned into reality and why it doesn't. it has to do with things feeling "normal".

when what we were creating felt really big (like a dream come true), it never worked out or had serious problems -- but when I knew they/we could do it and it was totally a doable thing then it worked out effortlessly.

you know, yesterday I was talking with remi about this exact subject because I was telling her that I noticed that when I start getting more motivated, I also notice that she's is also more motivated too. I wasn't telling her that to say that I'm influencing her motivation -- but that I see more and more of what I'm paying attention to. I doubt that she had dramatic fluctuations in her behaviour based on my motivation just like I doubt her physical form completely rearranged itself when I started talking about the weeds. the reality is, I just can't trust what I see as anything emperical because I *only* notice what resonates with me. very rarely now do I notice stuff that doesn't resonate with me.

I talked with dad about this around father's day when I told him that my entire world is becoming a complete reflection of the way I conceptualise reality.

I turn your imagination into reality because I don't "see" what you see, and so by not seeing the image, I don't see the implied limitations... scottie said it better in snake-bros #110, but here's a similar quote from off of his website:

    Some of the best lessons I've learned in life have nothing to do with the related experience, but everything to do with the application of the experience into another endeavor. For example, I once knew a junior national champion pool player. I noticed him intensely watching two inexperienced people just having fun shooting a game of pool. When I questioned him later about why he would waste time watching them play, he said that the *people who seemingly know the least about something sometimes come up with the best and most creative solutions, as they know no bounds or rules as to what can be applied.* -Scottie Baldwin

scottie, like josh (in #097), seriah, and adrienne, must all have strong astral capacities :) pay attention to the resonations.

[1]: I don't mean this in a derogatory way... I'm referring to it in the way that I've often heard the spaniards "describe" women they passed on the street or had met. sure, they use words like "baaaaam" or "waaaaaah" to "describe" her and true that randall usues much larger and more descripitive words, but the way I feel both of those is the same: it seems to me like an astral picture that's communicated over the medium of words and it gives me a sense of discomfort. I imagine that discomfort is the same way that other people felt around me when I had astral vision and I walked around with my mouth hanging open saying, "wow". it annoyed people, and I relate that annoyance daniel projected at he the same way I felt the listening to the spaniards describe women as I also feel with randall's description of the muzula flood or whatever.. it feels awkward because I'm supposed to be getting the magnitude of the event (or the girl), but it just sounds to me like children learning to make mouth noises -- which, perhaps, for them (like a shaman) those sounds are turning into 3d images before them. I just can't "see" it -- so I see people's reactions to these descriptions as I do to the feeling of porn. a *perfect* example is the intermission in book first of dtp (@[dtp/dtp](chapter-1-18)):

    > Reader, dost thou remember a promise given in previous pages, wherein I looked forward to a treat in scenic depiction, saying it was from another pen than mine? I redeem it now, for already the geologist is after me for having declared Arizona the scene of a lake or inland sea so vast as Miti, and so recently as twelve thousand years ago. I am reminded that he has decided from evidence afforded by erosion and weathering of the rocks in that amazing region, that while the Arizona desert was undoubtedly a lake or a seabed since the paleozoic time when it was the site of a shallow ocean, nevertheless that lake was certainly "of an age older than the Pliocene, being probably in the Cretaceous epoch." My friend, no. Those gorges and stupendous canons are not merely the gradual product of time and water and weather. Per contra, they are of sudden formation, the rending and cracking apart of the strata in a similar, but on a far more vast scale than the volcanic outburst at Pitach Rhok, described in the first chapter of this history. The Arizona wonders and the gorge of the "'Grand Canon of the Colorado" were the result of an awful dance of the solid crust of the globe. Even now the lava beds of the rectangle between the parallels 32 deg. and 34 deg. north latitude and 107 deg. to 110 deg. longitude west from Greenwich, in the Mt. Taylor and Mt. San Francisco region, have few parallels on earth as regards size. All over this hideous work of destruction, when the sea Miti had fled away into Ixla (Gulf of California) the rains and torrents of eleven thousand winter seasons, and the desiccating, powdering influences of as, many torrid summers have smoothed and chiseled and wrought the ruptured, ragged surfaces into yet more fantastic shapes, and claimed the whole work as its own, denying the hand of Pluto as the major worker. And the geologist seems to have admitted the claim, and placed the lake time far back, in order to allow a sufficient term for the execution of the gigantic work. And it is not so, for I saw that lake, only twelve thousand years ago. But now for the literary treat; it is taken from a very modern pen, but it is so faithfully descriptive of the appearance of the region to-day that I desire to enjoy its perusal with my readers. The words are those of Major J. W. Powell, U. S. Army

    > "The canon walls are buttressed on a grand scale, and deep alcoves are excavated; rocky crags crown the cliffs, and the river rolls below. * * * The sun shone in splendor on the vermilion walls, shading into green and gray where the rocks were lichened over; the river filled the channel from wall to wall. and the canon opened like a beautiful gateway to glory. But at evening, when the sun was going down and the shadows were settling in the canon, the vermilion gleams and roseate hues, blended with tints of green and gray, slowly changed to brown above, and black shadows crept over below-then it seemed the shadowy portal to a region of gloom. Lying down we looked straight aloft through the canon cleft and saw that only a little of the blue heaven appeared overhead--a crescent of dark blue sky with but two or three constellations peering down upon us. I did not sleep for some time, as the excitement of the day had not worn off. Soon I saw a bright star that seemed to rest on the very verge of the cliffs overhead. Slowly it seemed to float from its resting place on the rocks, out over the canon. At first it appeared like a jewel set in the brink of the cliff, but as it moved out I almost wondered that it did not fall. In fact, it did seem to descend in a gentle curve, as though the sky, in which the stars were set, was spread across the canon, resting on either wall, and swayed down by its own weight. The star appeared to be really in the canon, so high were the battlemented walls. The morning sun was shining in splendor on their painted faces. The salient angles were as if on fire, and the retreating angles buried in shade; the rocks, red and brown, blazed from their setting of deep gloom below, but above all was vermilion fire. The light above, made more brilliant by the bright-tinted rocks, and the shadows below, made more gloomy by the somber shades of sunlessness, increased the apparent depth of the awful canons, and it seemed a long, long way up to the world of sunshine--and was a mile!"

    I remember reading this in the book and I hated it so much I wanted to delete it. call it a romance novel to rocks or whatever -- but, it feels like porn to me.

### 2022-06-30 00:55 - going from astral to conceptual

as I wrote the above comment about geology porn, I was reminded of the few times that I did see astral and all of the strange reactions that I got to it. the weirdest one from daniel was him saying that he finds the way he looks to be weird and it's hard for to get used to seeing himself like that. I thought that was weird, because the extra space, to me, made everyone look more natural. I also noticed that I had a much better time reading facial expressions to notice the emotion too, whereas in normal 3d, the angle the face is viewed at, REALLY MATTERS -- like a lot. so many times a person has looked to me to be a very different emotion than what they said they were feeling -- and I attribute this discontinuity to either self-deception on their part, or the angle of appearance. I learned later that it's easier to feel them directly than to try and read their face -- because the faces people put on are largely a show (just look at youtube thumbnails, lol).

anyway, that's now what I wanted to talk about. in addition to things looking a lot more natural with an extra dimension, everything was also extremely breathtaking.

I noticed a progression because when I had just 3d, all I noticed was the hardships in life. david buckell would always tell us at bible study that "the world is a difficult and dangerous place" -- and that is mostly true. I also noticed that people who use their imaginations a lot, everything is a BIG F-ING DEAL -- so I correlated more imaginative people with everything being a bigger deal.

when I got astral (4d) perception though, the world was no longer so rigid and boxy, but now it had curves and depth that I had never seen before -- so now the world is no longer difficult and dangerous, but beautiful and enchanting. I loved to go around and enjoy nature and be in places that had massive architecture with lots of angles and extrusions because the extra stuff popping out at me gave the whole scene depth -- even a brick wall or a brick house with vines climbing up, the depth that's visible where the mortar is between the bricks is quite impressive to look at. so, I understand how easy it is to give so much attention to things that have such depth and beauty.

however, when I got 5d (I think it was something like 11-11-2018?), I couldn't see anything visually, but I could look around me anywhere I wished and peer into anything I chose to see -- but not visually. the world had a whole new feeling to it.

so if the physical is difficult and dangerous and the imagination is where everything is a big deal, the conceptual is the opposite of the physical: effortless and comforting.

the best way I can describe it is that warmth and love that you feel right before you die. well, all of reality feels that way. it's all just comforting, soft and sublime -- but no visuals.

images appear to me without anything to look at, and I seemingly "know" what they are. the things I don't know, they come to me eventually as I focus on the feeling. it's basically LOA experienced. anything I focus on, starts to become more and more known until I understand it and it's part of my experience.

---

so, when I was thinking about the part in adrienne's interview where she was describing her experience with this group, how it was a dream come true, it made perfect sense to me, because she's looking at things from the astral perspective. from there, everything is a really big deal.

if my life is a real mess, my imagination visualises a life that doesn't have a mess in it, but it sees a picture. you'll notice that you also feel a feeling with that picture, and you'll also notice that the picture isn't actually your life not being a mess, but something that *symbolises* your life not being a mess, like kids obeying or car running -- but that isn't life not being a mess.

so we get this idea that when the kids are obeying and the car is running *then* life isn't a mess anymore, when *it's actually the opposite*. the kids are obeying and the car is running when you feel like life isn't a mess anymore.

try to imagine that same thing from the 5d perspective where everything is normal, natural and comfortable. of course the car is running -- why wouldn't it? of course the kids are a reflection of my perception -- why wouldn't they be? or let's say the kids are doing something that someone doesn't like -- lol, well, duh, that person probably attracted it and the kids are cooperative to the other person's vibration ... duh.

see how from that perspective, nothing is a big deal anymore? notice how everything just flows?

personally, I prefer effortless flow to breathtaking images. I like feeling good, and I don't need something pretty or an image to get me there.

---

so really, I do sympatise with those that hated me when I had astral perception (or when I was smoking weed), because I made everything I was looking at a big deal, when really what people really want from me is not to make a big deal of what I see.

though, I do still enjoy from time to time a good joint[^1] and really enjoy some visuals and get my mind blown by a new way to look at something.

[1]: this was also a big problem for daniel because he liked to just smoke a joint and turn his mind off, so it was really annoying for him to smoke with me because my visual capacity started to turn on and I started making a big deal out of everything. he just wanted to sit around and do some linkedin or something... I found it appalling to waste such a magnificent mental moment in a corporate pissing contest. ah, I see -- probably linkedin fueled his imagination of making more money and doing more cool things... weird.

### 2022-07-01 16:17 - my beauty determines my mood (and some more logistics)

after writing @[dreamlog](2022-07-01 11:38), I fell asleep and had another dream where I was in a supermarket for little girls (or at least stuff like their diapers or something). there was one person pushing a cart where there was two babies in it one was light-skinned and the other dark. I remember thinking, that can only happen if they adopted the children. I thought it was a good idea of adoption. this wasn't the desired response from me and the scene changed again. I don't really remember it all, but mom was in the supermarket high up and I couldn't reach her. also every time that I was supposed to select a little girl, I did this thing where I turned inside out and then things abruptly changed again. obviously, I wasn't giving them the response they wanted. it was weird.

when I woke up, I was going over the dreams again... the part about the skin colour bothered me probably because I would look like a racist or for always noticing the white girls, and they kept getting my attention and stuff so I couldn't really do much. nosebook wants me to constantly be distracted by everything around and not have the capability to go inside of myself, and the white girls are just far more distracting than the dark ones. there's nothing I can do about that. it's probably because in general white people are much more distracted by so much stuff around them, so I'm on their frequency (and I'm white).

I've constantly tried all of my life to get inside of myself, but I constantly have distractions. even right now someone is twitching the bottom of my foot. if I could get less distracted all of the time I will be able to see the ones that are not so distracting, but for now that's how I am.

it became pretty apparent to me that they want to keep the little girls thing going because they can control it. they must know that little girls will basically never happen. logistically speaking, I'd have to spend some amount of time with them -- and really all of that feels very uncomfortable to me. I much prefer to be around adults so I can have intelligible conversations about things that actually matter. with little girls I can't really because they don't really know what they don't want yet.

so then I was thinking about who is actually most likely to find their alignment. I think it would most likely be a girl that's probably past her teens, probably an adult so she's doing things for herself and not reliant on others for her good-feeling. I also imagine she won't be increidbly pretty either, because most girls only know how to feel good when they look good.

I started to think about this a lot more and noticed that, in general, most men seem to associate a girl's ugliness with her temperment. the uglier she is, the more likely she will be to be nasty. I know that's not always true because some of the nastiest ones are the prettiest ones.

I started to think about that, and I think it's the same thing. if she feels pretty, she can feel really good about herself, but if she doesn't feel pretty, she gets an automatic excuse to act "like a bitch" -- and so I noticed that this correlation goes both ways: if I feel terrible, then I'm ugly, and if I'm ugly than I can feel terrible.

I noticed that this concept had the feeling that paul's father paul had when he said something about it being a miracle that he could be with his wife for half a century. I looked into it and I think she was probably somewhat "pija" in a younger age (having money and conditions to rely on), and so when she looked good, she felt pretty good. paul probably complimented her and they did pretty well for a while, but as she got older, she no longer felt herself to be pretty anymore and so therefore had her excuse to feel really bad and ensure others around her feel the same.

---

the next thing I wanted to notice is the opposite end of this spectrum because I was thinking about wang leehom's audience and was considering how when I listened to the song I felt a strong sense of technical capability (like adding in an extra snare or something) was giving the emotion of beauty -- and I think it may be related to this.

asians all tend to look pretty similar and there isn't nearly as wide of a variation between people as there is in the western world, so the concept of "if I'm beautiful, then I can feel good" doesn't work nearly as well, because there are less defining characteristics. it really came to me that technical capacity is actually what is admired and so that becomes the new version of beauty.

you see I would really fall pretty flat in asian culture because I struggle to do anything technical. the asians that I know which are trump and (can't remember her name right now) but type at insane speeds and are good at playing games technically. they think through their moves and can process large amounts of data rapidly -- neither of which I can do. I play mostly based on feeling and often don't know why I'm even doing something -- but after a while I get a full concept of the game and all of its structure. I noticed this difference in personalities between david (dog) and (can't remember her name) too.

ugh, OK. I'm going to end it there. there's more I wanted to say on that, but I can't get it to the front anymore.

### 2022-07-01 20:13 - a relevant thing to relate

as I was sitting outside, this felt like a revant thing to relate..

when I was in spain, I don't believe that I was actually attracted to andrea (or her to me). if you'll remember right, at that time I had decided to go the "asexual" route. I had collected enough data to realise that I didn't really want to be responsible for how others feel -- or the opposite which is making someone else responsible for how I feel. I wanted to find a way to feel the way I wanted to feel -- and that must have been attractive because according to marcos, andrea got some idea that she wanted to make me her boyfriend or something -- marcos was obviously against the idea. she seemed pretty heart-set on the idea, so eventually I caved in and decided that it was an OK thing to try. it didn't help that felt that abraham was seemingly coveying the message that if I just find a way to feel good, not because I want some manifestation, but because I actually wanted to feel good, then something would manifest.

those two things happening simultaneously (along with a few other "signs") gave me the impression that somehow that was supposed to happen or something. when things started to fall apart, I fought it a bit but really I knew that I shouldn't really make her the reason for why I feel good. instead, I made star-watching my reason for feeling good and did a lot of that instead. obviously, later on I had to stop using star-watching as my reason for feeling good... in general, the whole trajectory of my life has not been one of using conditions, no matter how great they are, as my reason for feeling good.

like, for example today I didn't go out and pick weeds because it was raining, and I noticed that have somehow even made pulling weeds a reason to feel good. I don't really want to do that because if I do, then it'll go away. every single thing that I've figured out how to turn into something I feel good about, goes away. it's just how it works for me, and I think to a large extent (if not all), this is self-sabotage. in my theory of fuzzing-time-pickles, the way that I exploit myself is to constantly affect the way that I'm attracting to remove any and all conditions I can possibly use as a reason to feel good.

as an example of this, I started programming kotlin again, and I started to have too much fun with it. I got done with it and I would feel really good, so then one day I go out to do weeds and the neighbour louis comes over and helps me to pull weeds. in the process, I showed a little bit of the idea that I was working on, and you know how "keep your ideas to yourself until they're fully developed" works which I think nosebook capitalises on a lot with me -- and so since then I haven't felt the motivation to program in kotlin.

basically, I manifested something that will come and remove the condition that I was using to feel good. so now, if I want to get back into programming, I don't want to make it the reason for my feeling good again. I'll just do it and no big deal. you'll notice that the most present concept in my life right now is one of not making something a big deal. everything that's a big deal has to go. it's the same really as using a condition to feel good. if it's not a big deal, it doesn't make me feel really good and so it's not a condition that I can use.

---

so going back to the andrea thing -- I don't really think that it was actual attraction because I wasn't actually capable of feeling the way I wanted to feel. I was attracting her in the negative sense (unwanted-and-wanted-are-same) because the illusion of her was the fastest way for me to start getting some practise to feel the way I wanted to feel without the conditions.

because marcos was constantly fighting her, I believe that is what made her want it more and what actually made it start to manifest. it was his fear, and he fought it because it didn't feel good to him. I explained to him a few times over drinks[^1] that the reason why he was feeling bad is because he was looking at it the wrong way -- not because it was actually bad. I believe the main resistance that he had was over what his friends would think and say about him. the sense that I got is that he thought his friends were going to think that he was using his daughter as a sort of prize (cause he wasn't really paying me anything) to get affinaty off of the ground.

so really, what I'm saying is that it actually worked out perfectly. I wasn't actually looking to find another condition to use to feel good, and he didn't want to be seen whatever way. so the attraction actually was spot on.

---

the other thing that I'd like to say is that I'm not actually all that hard to catch up to. I'm going really really slow right now. anyone who invests any amount of time star-watching (and then releasing resistace so their accelerated life doesn't fall apart) can *easily* catch up to me.

there are so many really great conditions that can be utilised to do it. for example, in LA, when I was star-watching on the side of the mountain there, I couldn't hear the city but I could still feel its energy it was especially powerful and almost effortless. LA is a great place because there is a lot of energy all over the place because of such a dense population that it would go really fast. another really amazing place to star-watch would be would be russ's tower. I've always found the top of hills to be very energetic[^2] and elevated places like rooftops are also better too, and also it sounds like he's kinda out in the middle of nowhere, so litting the mind begin to wander so you can leave your body is a lot easier than doing it next to a road or something.

another thing that I was thinking of is one of those asian super technical guys could *easily* get way better at watching-stars than I ever did in a shorter period of time. it's just focus and then releasing resistance after the energy is faster. in fact one of those buddhist monks could get there waaaaay quicker than with meditation, because watching-stars *is* meditation, so they're already good at that -- then, just add in the releasing of resistance to maintain the state and you're there.

if you want to try it, *releasing resistance is the most important thing* -- even with someone with as bad of technique as me doing it next to loud traffic I can get there, I'm very certain that others can get much better results. if you stagnate and can't get any higher (meditating or star-watching), that means you're not releasing resistance, and so your own resistance is preventing you from going higher.

all I'm saying is, it's not that hard to catch me.

I'd stay away from secret societies though because they'll make you take an oath to keep stuff a secret, and that'll basically keep you distant from me. I'll probably never meet randall or robert grant, for example, because I can't keep a secret -- and I intend on asking lots of questions about subjects they won't be able to talk about -- and that sucks, so don't do it. if everything interesting has to be kept a secret, what on earth would we talk about? maybe the weather (CO2 and stuff?). that's probably taboo also.

I think maybe "real self-sacrifice" is knowing that every condition I use as a reason to feel good, has to go.

[1]: bad idea because every time he forgot it the next morning.

[2]: you can imagine how powerful it would be to watch-stars on the apex of the great pyramid -- forget the kings chamber -- the apex is where all the energy is.

### 2022-07-03 12:22 - preservation

I noticed some reactions to @[string-board](2022-07-02 12:12) where I (probably unfairly) lumped all of those that want to preserve ancient knowledge into the group of the "skake-bros" (ie the "brotherhood of the serpent") -- the group of people which were interested in injecting knowledge into a civilisation to kinda give it a boost (or direct it -- it's unclear).

on one hand, the injection of knowledge looks a lot like a way to control and steer the society, but on the other hand, it does look to me like an adult will do with a kid where they show them "the right way" to do things. I don't know how I feel about injections of knowledge, personally.

however, when it comes to preservation, I've noticed that for me preservation has never been a good thing. for example, my old code for the "observable" and all of that stuff was lost on my mac when that stopped turning on for longer than a second or two. the result is that when I started programming the other day, I decided to go the route of learning kotlin (a decision I very much enjoyed) and also I rewrote the library in the new language. I would say that overall it was quite a beneficial experience for me. I'm even thinking that I may want to rewrite it again because I learned so much about kotlin in the process.

---

the other thing that sparked the thought is that I was listening to conspirinormal #413 where seriah talks about the seth material. much of what he talks about seth saying, I've deduced from my own investigations into what I call the conceptual realm or maybe as plato would say, the "realm of ideas" -- the place where we translate those vibrations as knowing, feeling, emotion, and idea/concepts. it's also the place where dead people are and though you can communicate with ghosts via channeling or visions, this is the same field out of which "you" (who you really are) is operating this meat automaton that you *think* is you.

I've never really looked too much at the death part and I've described my "near death experiences" in other places, but they're nothing like others' NDEs. I appear to bypass the astral plane entirely, and go right to the top of the conceptual plane where there is no time (in the linear fashion that we know it) and "you" are multiple personalities projecting down into the physical. seriah's explanation of what seth talks about with the oversoul and the different parallel incarnations is most similar to what I've experienced -- though for me it's a very non-visual experience.

he's totally right about the personality continuing beyond death, but it does change because you don't need some of the personality traits developed to navigate certain things in life.

another weird thing that he said is that souls incarnate in groups and you purposefully create "enemies" for other people (though I think he means yourself) to experience difficulty so that new can be created -- a view I feel very close to as it's part of the whole self-sabotage idea.

now, earlier last night I was talking to mom about the UFOs stuff and I mentioned that I believe that they're created beings (golems), and they have been used to get knowledge and technologies (and genetics in the case of the longheads) to the ruling elite.

the ruling elite, I believe are the ones that I have called the "fallen-angels" -- and these guys are very interested in preservation. in @[metal-lucifer](2022-06-29 00:54) I talked about how I thought it would be to live forever, just transferring from body to body (the opposite of the "death" experience that I've encountered where I see interesting things and jump back into the physical).

    imagine you did live for a very very long time, just transferring your consciousness from body to body -- I don't think you'd be too concerned about your "loved ones" anymore -- you'd be pretty calculating and self-centred. I also believe you would become exclusively materialistic, because there's no way to think about anything else, either. the "spirit realm" is just a hierarcy of power looking to take control of the resources in planes below them.

    it would be miserable, I agree, but I don't think they would be too concerned with family or friends. my wife is going to die, so just get a new one -- friends go away too, so just get a new ones. so, since everyone is only a transient entity passing through my experience, I optimise my presentation to those temporary passer-bys to ensure that I get the most out of them as they pass through my experience. this means I'm very concerned about what everyone else thinks, and I don't have any real meaningful relations -- everyone is just a temporary thing for me to use.

if I'm going to go from body to body and never die, and because of mounting resistance, things are getting more difficult, I can imagine the desire to try and preserve knowledge and improvements so as to reduce the time it takes to reinvent those things. in fact, from their perspective the more prefab consciousness they could preserve between body transfer, the faster it would be to get back up to speed controlling things again.

so, for me the whole origin of preservation is in the astral -> physical, astral -> physical incarnation cycle, because they try to keep as far away from the world of ideas as possible, because that's where manifestation is instant (we then see those changes in vibration expand out into events which coalesce into a meaningful timeline which transforms the vibration from one to another).

personally, I prefer the idea of death, and I've come to appreciate doing things over again and finding a new less-resistant way to do the same thing rather than to carry the old knowledge forward. especially now that I've released so much resistance to so many things. knowledge does not seem like something I need to hold on to. I've written a lot of things about electricity and magnetism, but I don't remember any one of those things specifically -- instead, whenever I want to know more about it or new data comes up, I just look at the concept after I've added the new data into the vibration, and I can see more.

I don't know of a way that I can "preserve" that concept, other than, just don't conceptualise my reality in a way which makes it difficult for me to tune into it in the first place.

---

I'm not against preserving anything as I think it's fine -- though it does carry the vibration of the past forward each time it's preserved. I woke up this morning thinking about what it would be like if I were to make a civilisation of people on a planet that I made it very difficult to have any "memory" at all in the physical/visual/sensation sense and so all reality is formed on a foundation of concepts rather than memories. sure the world would be a lot more liquid, as everyone would have their own version of reality, and everything would be as you feel it to be, with preservation, essentially impossible.

it's a tantalising idea for me, and a resonance to that is scottie baldwin's description of what he actually "makes" -- because he said everything he creates vanishes into thin air and is not preserved at all. his only way to preserve something is a "digital asset" (a recording) and that's only as good as your storage system is. it also reminded me of his own definition of himself as well. he said he used to have "eidetic memory" where he could see the image in his minds eye, but now later on in his life his memory has transformed to be held in the form of concepts that have stuck with him over the years rather than visual memories. so what he makes now is nothing ephemeral, but a feeling that's felt in the moment and enjoyed by many then vanishes. I thought that was a pretty good description of communication by concepts and the transition that one makes from a visual to a conceptual memory.

hrmmmm, interesting. I'll leave that there.


### 2022-07-04 18:06 - the ancient serpent and an old dream I had

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_x03O1-MHI)

huh, interesting ... I just noticed that the timestamp is the same day that they recorded the show: 06:06 (PM). I'm also reminded of an old (apocalyptic) dream that I had probably around 2004-5 or so (I've mentioned it before). I was drowning in the ocean and I saw that the united states was falling apart. I could see an a fighter jet painting the words "SOS" in the sky. I took this to be a signal that bad things were going to happen. my father rescued me from the water, and I was laying on the sand looking at the "SOS" in the sky, and when I opened my eyes, it was my red LED alarm clock flashing "6:06" (I guess the power had gone out). it was weird.

---

anyway, I wanted to talk about the second half of that episode because he starts to talk about the garden of eden and the serpent in the OT. in the NT he is the last book of the bible, rev 12 where the ancient serpent that *deceived* mankind is once again deceiving and this *deception* is what causes the michael and his angels to cast fire and rocks toward the earth (censer imagery and everything)...

OK, so kyle brought up that the serpent is a symbol for knowledge, and randall brought up that YHVH didn't want their *eyes to be opened*, and so it was their opening of the eyes that was the problem.

OK, so just track with me. in various places around the bible, the serpent is the kundalini rising ... it's the spiraling/rotating energy that rises up the spine and then the whole head gets filled with light. this is when crazy attraction starts to happen very rapidly. that explains the knowledge and the eyes being opened part.

now, once the kundalini has risen, then you become very attractive and reality happens very fast, and so you could imagine that if a whole bunch of people were to have their kundalini to rise up, it would spell disaster really quickly. inotherwords, when the ancient serpent (kundalini) begins to rise again, this is what attracts these projectiles that pierce the earth's atmosphere (comets, etc.).

so the serpent of old is not really any exterior character in particular, but actually a condition. to explain this, randall delves into the word, "deceive" -- and that is to wander, to stray away from, or to go the unorthodox way.

orthodoxy is the "mainstream" or "standard model" of perception, and when people had their kundalini rising up, everyone had their own way of perceiving reality become real to each of them personally. this creates conflict and it's that conflict that causes dissatisfaction.

sure, if everyone were on the same page and believing the same thing, then supposedly all would go well... I disagree.

---

OK, earlier today I had a discussion with jeri about DMT, serotonin, and melatonin. I was explaining to her that serotonin is mostly produced in the gut in response to your emotion (that's what gut feelings are). that serotonin gets then synthesised (I believe) in the pineal gland into DMT and melotonin. so, when you don't feel very good, your body will turn that serotonin into melotonin which will cause you to sleep. the serotonin now converted into melotonin still contains the vibration of the emotion and so when you sleep you stop thinking for a while, so your vibration wanes and you become less resistant. then upon coming back into consciousness, you begin to dream and those dreams are created from the vibration of your previous emotions (serotonin->melotonin), so the symbols, images, and feelings that you experience in the dream come about as the vibrational difference between your now less-resistant state (from sleeping) and the vibration of your melotonin.

the result is the perception of that emotion from a much less resistant state, and so the emotion is perceived very symbolically. obviously those symbols create a new emotion and that's the emotion that you start your day with.

---

OK, so you can probably see that process as happening pretty well in the waking phase of life, but imagine for a moment that your kundalini has risen and your pineal is producing DMT instead of melatonin. well, those symbols are going to start taking shape just like they are in your dream state, but without having lowered resistance -- sorta like a nightmare -- which is just not having released resistance (ie holding on to an emotionally troubling thing) so those symbols trigger some deep emotions in you and they turn into bigger problems.

basically, when the serpent "deceived" everyone, our kundalini's rose, some people experienced amazing things and others a complete nightmare. the catastrophe is the result of the nightmare.

personally, I believe that when that happens, there is an automatic split that happens, because if I'm living a really nice reality and someone else is living a nightmare, they're incompatible, so I wouldn't really worry too much about all of that if you're good at attracting what you want.

---

so now I want to remind you of the deceiver part -- the staying from the orthodox perception of reality. I've contended in various places that the whole goal of nosebook is to ensure that the unauthorised people don't get their kundalini to rise. I'd have to check with randall on this, but it's very likely that the secret societies that teach this stuff have strict guidelines on how to operate (IMO, very limiting) to prevent doing too much damage to yourself and to others. this is probably ensured through a merit system and so only once you've proven your ability not to cause serious problems, then you can have it. whatever it is, it's the "you gatta earn it" vibe. what I'm trying to say here is that their system is setup and designed not to cause a lot of problems -- so they're the "orthodox", and we're the hotshots that are going to start going a different way from the orthodox and attracting a cataclysm[^1].

what my dream this morning was about was the idea of going the wayward (unorthodox) way *without* the kundalini (serpent of old) opening our eyes and "deceiving" us.

---

there are a number of implications to this idea, and the major one that I contend is that we're all going to go for a very long time without our "eyes being opened". personally, I don't really find this to be a problem as I'm totally cool without having all of the visuals. if I never get the "eyes opening" bit, that's totally fine with me. it just means my attraction speed is going to be a lot slower than it would otherwise be. however, given the current acceleration of my attraction, this seems perfectly fine to me.

the other major problem with this is the space problem. what I mean is, "they" (the people running the show) don't want us getting out into space because once we go to mars, then we have all of this stuff there and what if there is archeology that's done there, etc. it's a big problem for them, and they'll likely have to get rid of a lot of the stuff that's present on mars[^2] and other places around the solar system.

[21:21 - dad called, so starting again]

you know, the other night I was talking about why it's possible that the UFOs, which I believe are created entites (golems) are essentially giving technology to the US govt. in this context, it may be so that they can scrub the solar system of any incriminating evidence that they feel they need to get rid of. the other thing that would do, is remove that old technology and get rid of it, so that we could indeed start over. furthermore, in this context, it may be that the whole 2038 deadline may in fact actually be for *them* to get off of the planet and go somewhere else. I don't really know and it's too hard to tell.

so let's just explore this idea and assume that they're the ones that are going to scrub the ancient technology evidence and move to another location in the solar system... let's just say (for sake of brainstorming) that they destroy the great pyramid and most ancient structures along their way out, too. I don't imagine that they'll do it any time soon, so we have some time to start to figure out technology for ourselves allowing us to get our own infrastructure up and running and everything, but the thing is, we'll eventually (probably pretty rapidly) get enough tech to get off of the planet ourselves, so when the time comes for that to happen, they'll either have to find an even further place out or we'll kind of like just sort of leave them be.

the reason why I say that is, I've noticed in my own experince that it's not really practical to try and fight them. they have their system setup, but ultimately they don't really impede me any, so I just sort of let them be however they want to be. they don't really want to change, and they don't really impede me anyway, so why do I need for them to change.

the next issue is that they want to remain in the shadows. I don't really mind that they want to be in the shadows, and I don't really care to try and reveal them, either. so again, we'll eventually come to a point that it'll become impossible for them to remain in the shadows any longer -- and from my perspective I don't really care, but I can't really speak for everyone -- but in the future if they were revealed to me I wouldn't try to get rid of them or try to block them in any way. they're not really even a nuisance either. I feel to them about the same as I feel about bigfoot. they may exist and they really don't want to interact with humans at all, so I just don't really care. I don't have any problem to cohabitate a place with them. they're less primitive than bigfoot though in the sense that if they wanted to communicate in any way, they could. it's not like they're much different than we are in terms of physical capability, so it's entirely up to them.

OH, so this idea is the opposite one of the @[string-board](2022-07-02 12:12) in that instead of going off to pluto, they go off to pluto and intstead I'm stuck here with the humans. they'll have to do their best to continue to keep us out of the astral and whatever else it is that they need to do to remain hidden.

this whole thing seems to be a subject of them wanting to remain hidden. looking at it logically, they have secrets here on earth and out in the solar system and a separation/barrier is necessary to keep secrets. they're ahead of us right now in the space program, so they could potentially get off of the planet much easier. so the question becomes who leaves. if they leave, then they'll have to clean up a lot of evidence here on earth, and if I leave along with them, then they have to become "friendly" with me cause we're not neighbours (like pacha had to make friends with kuzco) and I'm not sure that's what they want to do.

---

all in all, none of most of the above really matters (cept maybe to them). what matters is the original message, which is going to unorthodox path without the serpent (kundalini), and in the process, figuring out our own technology. in reality, if we just do that, there's not really a whole lot they can do about anything -- as our technology will keep getting more advanced, so no matter how much they "infiltrate" us (by "us", I mean me and anyone that wants to join me), they still can't really do any damage because it's all attraction.

it feels like naturally, this whole thing will solve itself by way of attraction because they'll have to fight against it, so anyone joining me will learn, like I have, that they can't really do anything. those trying to fight them fighting will eventually succumb to their own resistance. it's pretty sure that we'll find ways to come up with good conditions here on earth, so many will try and use those conditions to overcome their own resistance, and that's also fine. everyone will naturally come to the conclusions about what they want.

I figure that it won't be too long before we're in the process of creating and occupying new planets and solar systems, so we'll just sorta give them a head start, start over, taking it slow and steady and they can hold on to their old ways of doing things all they want to.

---

the opposite perspective of the thing is that they are stuck here on earth because the great pyramid is what keeps them alive, and so in reality they can't really leave -- meaning that this will end up sorta like an exodus.

I dunno if that's a thing. during the writing of this, I've gotten a number of reactions about the great pyramid, one being that if it's destroyed, the earth will spin very rapidly and all manner of life will change very dramatically. the other is that they can't really leave the great pyramid. so it seems they're pretty tied to preserving the great pyramid.

fortunately, that's totally not my problem, at all. I just keep going forward on whatever it is that interests me and they have to continue to adjust to the changing circumstances. the way it looks now after writing this is that they don't want to leave earth, so there's no way to get them out of here. it looks like they'll be here continually with the more primative humans that they can "rule" over (ancient surveyors, hehe), and I should just do whatever cause they're running out of ways to stop me.

so probably the conclusion here is that I/we have to find our own way off without the kundalini/serpent. we'll just sorta leave them to do whatever. interesting. OK, gonna think about it a bit more.

[1]: yes, of course this is a very generalised view, and I can feel the reactions wondering why these secret societies often cause problems on earth (starting wars, etc. ref: bramley, gods of eden) -- but just for the sake of argument, let's assume that all of them are the same and they're all following the laws which minimise risk of catastrophe -- unlikely to be true, but just go with it.

[2]: who knows what they're doing up there, and I've noticed that the planet is much less red, meaning that their planet probably isn't running the pyramids at full speed anymore, so the red (iron oxide) is going out of the atmosphere. iron is the final stage in the fusion process, and I believe this is why OAHSPE calls earth the "red star" because we had a very red atmosphere because of the high fusion[^3] happening in the atmosphere producing a lot of iron, which iron + oxygen is your formula for sunscreen -- it prents UV radiation from passing through.

[3]: apparently the stellar nucleosythesis creating elements past iron takes a lot of energy: "Iron cannot be fused into anything heavier because of the insane amounts of energy and force required to fuse iron atoms." -- so if the the pyramids are emitting a lot of protons and energy to make fusion happen, there will be [a lot of iron laying around](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_peak).

### 2022-07-07 13:38 - thinking about the future again

this may need to go in dreamlog, but I woke up yesterday with a train of thought about @[blahblog](2022-07-04 18:06), and I was talking about doing the whole thing *without* the kundalini rising.

so dad calls while I'm writing about the redness on mars being caused by iron oxide in the atmosphere as a result of the fusion process produced by the pyramids on the planet. we talk about a bunch of stuff but there were a lot of snake-bros related topics I realised.

I talked about how I didn't really understand how to compose music very well because I'm supposed to put the notes on these lines and my mind doesn't really think that way. I think of them as ratios and I would say that I have much higher inclination to have "relative pitch" rather than "perfect pitch" because I feel all of the notes in relation to each other.

I was trying to explain that I noticed that any single note by itself doesn't really take me as being great or not great. it's only when that note is next to another note that it gives me a feeling. back when I was in his house and I was trying to compose the "flight of the butterfly" song, I just didn't really understand ratios then, and I really didn't know how to fit those ratios into the defined structure of ABCDEFG notes. so on the one side I was really wanting to get to another way of making music.

we also talked about automating his home garden and how that would be really cool to setup a few arduinos to do the watering for him. so, when I woke up yesterday, I was thinking about this in the context of the snake-bros and their wine grapes. they probably have something like that setup -- and if they don't, they should probably think about it. anyway, the idea in my head was to offer them to do some automation for them, but it didn't really feel like a good idea, so I decided to wait and see what happens -- as in like how will it transform.

I didn't like the idea for a number of reasons: I don't really like the idea of drinking, and it seems like a higher possibility of being around wine that I'll start to drink and I don't really like that idea. I know that drinking is kinda like a double-sided thing because if I'm by myself or in a really good environment (like a festival or with friends), then the alcohol experience is really really great and I'm extremely non-resistant. at the same time, in resistant environments, again with the lowered resistance of alcohol, I feel much more inclined to behave in not good ways. for example, I keep lowering resistance and that's what keeps expanding my vision, but lower resistance isn't synonymous with good behaviour. I attract my environment and by having my environment a reflection of my perception, I can interact with it without any resistance.

*however*, if I ingest alcohol that will adjust my perception and so therefore I'm going to be attracting differently. that means that if somehow under that preception if someone is really annoying to me, I might very well hit them because that's what they feel like to me -- annoying -- so I behave like how they feel. so instead, I prefer to have my perception completely under control so that I can see and feel people the way that *I* want to see and feel them.

that's kinda one issue. the other is that there are literally millions of people capable of installing a garden automation system, so it's not really something that I need to do. sure, it is a sort of way to get started using electronics again and even possible use that as a launching pad off to discover more ideas about electricity, but I'm not really interested in that right now.

I let the idea ride out for the rest of the day and there were other forms of resistance that showed up as well. eventually, it'll all feel effortless, like flying -- and that's when I know I'm ready. still feels like trying too hard. anyway, later on I wanted to do some programming. I don't really know why I feel so attracted to programming, but I finally figured out what the problem was -- and it was that I didn't actually draw the stage... the whole time I'd been spinning my wheels not really understanding what is going on, and it was a simple thing all along.

---

so this morning, when I wake up, I noticed that the garden automation system has waned, and this time I'm thinking about my program because it runs off of screens, and I noticed that each screen is kinda like a point in the sequence. so I got to thinking about how to make UI based off of a sequence of screens. it would completely change how things are built and so I wanted to explore that idea more.

I waited to write about it because my computer wasn't working properly this morning when I woke up and also I wanted to let the idea sit again. I noticed that despite my explaining that I wanted to go the direction of not having the kundalini rise, it still seems like there is effort to get me to go with girls again. I kinda associate the whole snake-bros idea with girls and so it feels weird to me to go in the direction of something that I don't want. I want to find my alignment *without* the kundalini rising. as I've mentioned before, eventually my attraction will become so strong that the things that I feel in reality will become manifest. this idea is reallly invigourating to me because that means I can *externalise* my imagination, meaning that everything that I imagine in the form of feeling[^1] will become real tangible solid mater just as real as anything else. I'll be able to change the state of things from one to another like mainin changed lolix to stone and be able to vanish anything I want as well. that obviously is pretty awesome[^2]. I really like that idea.

so I like the idea of going the full distance without the kundalini rising. I'm sure there are some secret branches of nosebook that are working to try and produce a cataclysm. they're sorta stuck in a problem if the world keeps getting better and better. they need chaos so that michael and his archangels can wipe out lots of humans. it's kinda funny how large of a problem it is for them for things to be getting better and better. so I'm kinda steering clear of girls for a long time because I don't want to cause kundalini to rise.

the way I've been feeling it out is that they're efforting to influence me to get into an unstable situation. it feels like they need me to make the decision (or have others' desire attract me toward the decision) to go toward instability because every time that they've tried to steer me toward it, it's backfired a bit.

the next part is hard to figure out, but it seems like they want to go in the direction of the girls because then that'll be a lot of kundalini rising and then from there they can just sit back and poke at the fire from everyone's attraction, but this is having a difficult time of happening because I maintain my environment as a reflection of my perception, so sure there are small problems, but like the guy on leftl-2022-01-30 (last exit for the lost) said in response to seriah thinking the world will destroy itself, "things just have a way of working themselves out" -- and I totally agree with that. things will continue to work theirselves out as long as I'm the dominant perceiver.

[1]: it's hard to describe this, but just like how when you think of a word to say, *before* there are words, there's an idea. well, likewise, before an image shows up in your imagination, again there's an idea that precedes it.

[2]: it may not be that awesome for other really imaginative people to have this capacity because everything they imagine would become reality. there's also the problem of others being able to see and physical evidence of everything imagined. it'll require quite a temperance of imagination.

### 2022-07-08 01:51 - imprecise thoughts about externalising my imagination

I just got done watching snake-bros #117 - history of precision, where archer is talking about machines and precision and stuff like that. there's a moment in there where he's describing his 3d printer and the machine at his work with the numbered tool bits, when I had a sudden realisation -- wait, I need context:

in the previous entry I described how I didn't want to go in the direction of the snake-bros right now because I didn't want the kundalini to rise, and for whatever reason I have associated with that direction (well, nearly all directions) that is the path of the girls, and so therefore kundalini eventually, which is what I don't want to do. instead, I said that I wanted to continue on doing going about all of this because I can see that if I continue in this direction, I believe it'll be possible to externalise my imagination making what I imagine appear as real solid matter. essentially I'd have a mental 3d printer -- capable of printing those parts as fast as I can feel their idea (which will be nearly instant). my tool changeover speed will be as fast as I can focus a new feeling.

so I'm listening to archer talk about these precision things and I'm remembering the entry I wrote today about that and I can see the conflict between the two. that's what the first part of this entry is about...

---

first of all, I'm coming at this from an angle where every single thing that I've tried to do to produce anything has been strongly opposed by nosebook. they do not want me programming. they just want me to placate their female audience (they only perceive dissatisfaction -- their own and others), and so they don't want me doing anything related to tech. I'm totally fine with that I program mostly for my own enjoyment, anyway. I'll just encourage and join in on others' endeavours even if I don't pursue any myself.

in addition to no tech, they neither want me using any physical conditions to get a physical advantage (drugs, etc.) -- and I'm totally fine with that. like I wrote in the previous entry, I enjoy controlling my perception completely. it's possible that I could eventually figure out how to prevent even drugs or conditions from modifying my perception, but I'm not quite to that level yet. this is the first major contradiction (we'll explore more soon) because they don't want me using any conditions like drugs or energy devices or anything to improve my consciousness, but historically speaking, sex is the #1 most popular path toward enlightenment -- so, it kinda wonders to me why they would want me engaging in that condition.

between the no tech and no conditions, I'm left with the only possiblity remaining: how I feel and how I perceive things. there's nothing they can do to stop either of those; there's no way to prevent thoughts from producing a feeling and there's no way for them to prevent me from redefining how I look at something so that the feeling response feels good.

I've spent nearly all of my life in front of a computer and involved with tech in some way -- and if it weren't for the effort that nosebook puts on me, I would do tech. it's my default solution provider. I always thought like this -- instead of finding a way to feel good about my unproductive situation, I'll write a timer program or a TODO app or something which I think will make me more productive, all the while not changing the perception that's causing me not to enjoy what I want to do.

I've talked at length about how I believe these ancient civilisations used technology as a solution to their problems yet, the technology masks the underlying dissatisfaction -- which despite the number of productivity enhancing programs that one could write, it's still doesn't fix the underlying problem. I believe the catastrophes that humans have experienced in the past have been a result of that underlying dissatisfaction growing to monumental porportions (no pun intended).

what seems to be happening is that this whole effort is to make machines that are so fast, they can produce a ridiculous amount of stuff really quickly -- so if you think to yourself what this could look like on a large scale: think of the exponential productivity that we're going through right now and imagine the vision that archer conveyed when talking about his 3d printer and russ with image of millions of minds all contributing to the technology as opposed to a monolithic corporaton (this time, no pun intended) -- and how far we could go now that extremely high levels of precision are available to the average guy, making high-precision mass production of a thing possible to anyone -- with things like kickstarter making it even more accessable.

I think that's the whole point. I have so many good ideas on this, and it'd be pretty cool to get a whole bunch of people in creating technology like this... obviously.

though, like I said, I don't believe it'll solve the dissatisfaction problem though, so that's where I come in. it'll become apparent more and more as time continues on, so I can say that I provide a pretty good stability in the form of my perception. I'm getting so good at noticing improvements all around me, that I totally see humankind doing really great and stuff -- and if I see it, then it's reality (at least for me -- others can make their own reality). so eventually, when I finally go away, that stable perception will go away and you'll create the reality that you feel no matter how much technology is there. sure, it'd be great if humankind could figure out, as I've done, that you don't need technology or conditions to feel good -- just some adjustments to perception -- and if that did happen, it seems like there would be lots and lots of people capable of creating whatever they wanted, and that's cool.

anyway, in @[blahblog](2022-07-04 18:06), I started to explore the idea that I'm actually here to stay for quite a long time, and that it's actually the amun priesthood that has to get off of the planet. in addition, there's a really interesting thing going on with pluto, charon, and the moon. they are 4, 2, 6 (respectively) and have interesting proportions to each other (especially in relation to the earth). so I don't know where they want to relocate me to -- and I estimated that I probably needed to get quite a distance from the sun and pluto is the furthest one out.

however it works out, I may be here for a while and so if I'm here for a while, that means we're going to have a long time to create a lot of cool stuff.

it would honestly be pretty cool to work on that technology, but it seems that I'm forced to go the perception route. when I'm finally externalising my imagination, I do wonder how annoying that would be to find out (for those working on the tech), that I can just create that stuff as fast as I can "imagine" it. or, who knows, maybe I'll never actually ever get that capability until the sun's energy finally makes it all the way out to pluto.I just don't know what they want. I personally don't think they know what they want.

---

this second part is about why in the previous entry I said that they want a cataclysm and they would get a cataclysm if I were to get connected, so why not just let me go and then watch everything go to hell really quickly. it doesn't make any sense, I know; short answer is dissatisfaction.

the long answer is, I'm fairly certain that me getting connected is extremely undesirable -- probably the most undesirable of all. obviously they will push against others getting technology that aren't a member of the cool kids club, so after some really lengthy amount of time I see all of humanity going in two (maybe three) directions: you have the dissatisfied (but very superior) tech guys, and the ones they need to keep away from conditions and tech (as outlined above).

I don't think it'll happen immediately. I think at first (in the pretty near future, actually) it'll be that situation that archer was talking about with so many people creating all sorts of really cool stuff. I think there's going to be a pretty big decentralisation of power as well, kinda forcing the amun priesthood to go further into hiding. though, I don't think that'll stop them though. I've been thinking a lot about this somewhat recently because I actually think that it'll kinda force them to go for the "least bad" policy rather than opposing everything dissatisfying (cause it just makes it bigger).

what I mean is, it seems to me like they'll be steering people always to create the technology that's least threatening to their setup -- which means that lots of cosmetic and meaningless technologies will be created, with effort to keep everything effective to a minimum.

I don't know how far they'll take it, because if they do it to any length like they did for me, I can imagine that anyone wanting to work on tech that actually has an impact will probably just have to take a break from tech for a while until they're good enough to feel the way they want to feel before diving back into it (like me now).

what I mean is, I think the reason why they want to keep me so far away from technology is because I actually have revolutionary ideas. they don't want any of that happening.

---

so you have to wonder then, if I like tech so much, why don't I just concede the fight and go the tech route with everyone else? well, that's because that's what everyone *is* doing. that's been done before (atlantis, romans, etc), but what *hasn't* been done before is the perceptual route.

I find it very likely that everyone who wants to go the perceptual route will get maximum difficulty on it (just like me) enabling all of the cool stuff[^1]. then, after thousands, millions, or billions of people have gone through it and they've increased the difficulty to maximum, I'll make another run through (leapfrogging-time-pickles) and they can finally face their fear of me getting connected.

that's just my ideas there... I forget to talk more directly about dissatisfaction leading to contradicting ("split-energy") efforts.

[1]: yesterday when I talked about the externalisation of the imagination being capable of modifying the chemical properties of something like mainin turning lolix to stone. the reactions to why a "bad guy" had such a capability -- and it seems that stuff was not impossible because ernon was producing food out of thin air with jehova technology. then further reactions about the "perfected 7th ray" -- and the idea here is that I find it possible that mainin is also pretty likely a created entity inserted into that timeline designed to produce certain events. again -- this is the YHVH (5.2) perception where you can create entites and insert them (or yourself) into the timeline. they're all "you" but different aspects of yourself just like the universe is all of us -- and we're all some combinations of aspects of the universe -- because if we weren't, we would no longer reaonate with this universe. in fact, nosebook is probably compose of many created entities of my own self with the express purpose of pushing me to get that that cool stuff.

### 2022-07-08 16:45 - indecision

today I was at walmart and -- well, first of all, it was a good example of being low resistance, because I mirrored the people I interacted with.

I started out the experince when jerrica asked me if I wanted to go and I didn't really feel like it was pulling me strongly (I felt indecision) so I went and asked the random coin flipper if I should go or not. it said no, but jerrica seemed to want me to go so I conceded and went with them to walmart.

she said we were just there to pick up salt and for the calendar we were going to go to the dollar tree. I have the common way of doing things where I know what I want, so I get in there and I get my stuff and I get out. I don't really like to spend a lot of time just hanging out feeling indecision about what I want to buy. I wanted a bag of salt but they just had small containers of it. so I got two, but jerrica thought I should get 4. I didn't think it was necessary but again I conceded (I didn't really want to argue; I just wanted to make the decision and go).

she then starts to "window shop"? -- I don't know how to call it but she was looking at shoes she clearly wasn't going to buy and kept asking if jaron liked them. I think jaron is predisposed to trying "help" her, so he got sucked right into it. I started asking her if she is feeling indecision in the isle because I really didn't want to stand there and look at shoes she's clearly not going to buy. I wanted to just get the calendar and get out.

so when asking jerrica if she's feeling indecision, I said something like indecision is what happens when you feel dissatisfaction (see last night's entry for more examples of "split-energy" and dissatisfaction) and then I wanted to try to get to the bottom of what's dissatisfying (keep in mind that I'm also feeling dissatisfaction because she's trying to get jaron to help her with shoes she's not going to buy). I just want to find a way to lessen the dissatisfaction so that we can buy our stuff and get out.

after saying the part about the dissatisfaction, a women decided to stand up for jerrica by saying that all women feel indecision. I strongly contested this idea saying that there's no way that *all* women are feeling dissatisfaction when they shop. that's completely impossible. nature optimises for diversity, so these sorts of binary statments are never true -- even though it feels that way. "all" and "none" feel true because of LOA, so it would be like a magnet saying that "all" iron is attracted to it -- which is true. she's just telling me that she's a strong attractor and that "all" of the people around her are the way she perceives them to be. inotherwords, "all" women in her reality conform to her conceptualisation of women.

her reality is how she conceptualises it to be.

---

so then I get home and I was thinking about how this whole trip had a foundation on indecision (I started it), and it carried itself all the way through -- which was, itself an extension of last night's discussion on dissatisfaction.

I had a lot of indecison and dissatisfaction going through all of it the whole way, and so I was thinking about how I select to do things based on "random" (like flipping a coin). you know... I'll have to come back to this second concept here about making "random" decisions to avoid dissatisfaction.

### 2022-07-11 20:44 - having something/someone to care for/to

last night I was working on some code and I kinda got derailed and I drifted off into the internet and found myself reading the site for "guava" which is a java library from google. I love to read people's code cause it gives me a feeling of who they are and/or the company culture associated with it. I don't think I actually read any code but just reading the wiki about all of the jusifications that they made in deciding what sorts of things to avoid with the library was quite charged with emotion.

google is so extremely 3rd ray, I find it fairly difficult to process. the entire thing has so much emphasis on how the parts can be moved around and work together in an efficient way that, there is literally ZERO big picture at all. everything is so compartmentalised, they have "confidential repositories" that need to be able to import code from the "main" code and also return any improvements made back upstream. all of this has to be done flawlessly without much disturbances. that's all I have to say about that.

now on the completely opposite end of the spectrum, I don't find code to feel anything like what I felt reading the google stuff. I find it very enjoyable and it's something that gives me a feeling like I'm taking care of something. that sense of "ownership" or perhaps even nurture is what I experience when I write code. to begin to illustrate the opposite feeling of this, I had a number of reactions wondering why in the world would I be forsaking such a vibrant set of opportunities and instead invest my time in something like coding. that's not the best translation of the feeling, so maybe something like why when I have such amazing things would I want to go to do gruntwork (implication there is that they're just cogs in the google code machine).

---

I woke up this morning still thinking about those reactions and I was noticing another really peculiar thing. for me, that care or nurture that I experience when I'm writing code is very much a feminine aspect.

I also noticed that a lot of people that "care" -- often the keyboard warriors -- seem to experience the lack of care and so then go and try to push really hard against the problem. I also noticed that I really don't know how women can possibly do it; how can they express their feminine side of wanting to care or nurture something, when most of them don't really build, create, or program anything. it felt to me like the only thing they can really invest their time and nurture into are children. for me, I simply couldn't handle this because I would spend the first many years of my life waiting for something/someone to really care for, and finally the only thing remaining is to wait for a child. it's no wonder that so many women abandon that side of them and go the opposite way of trying to push things through to get what they want (or become a cog in the machine).

---

I enjoy programming because I can take an idea and turn it into something that I can interact with. that idea becomes real. that idea becomes something unto itself. others can join me in that idea or I can join others in their idea. programming for me is taking the big picture (2), converting it into pieces (3), and then making it become a real thing I can interact with.

if I were to try and do that with a child, that seems a lot more not quite the same thing -- though I believe it's possible -- in fact, once I master the concept of something, I do believe that conceptualisation for a child or for a project is simply as easy as knowing what one wants, and then holding on to that feeling through the conceptualisation process.

I have a concept that I've been trying to turn into a reality for a long time, and for me this whole process is really good practise to learn how to feel the way I want to feel. there seem to be many efforts to try and prevent me from going in the direction of the project that I want to make (I've called it "meaningful-chaos"), but in reality what I realised today is that this isn't really about the project; it's about learning to hold me feeling constant, despite the condition. when I'm able to feel the way that I want to feel about the concept that I'm creating, that's when I've figured out the care/nurture aspect. it's not about the parts; it's about the "big picture" -- which, although it may have a picture associated with it, behind the picture is a feeling. that's the *real* big picture -- because the actual image that underlying feeling produces can change over time.

I use visual words all the time to describe feelings. I've been known to have synethesia, and when listening to music, feelings get turned into patterns and stuff, but I want to emphasise that when I say "big picture" -- I'm talking about how I feel about something. I believe the brain (mine at least) processes feeling visually. perhaps for some it has audio elements so they turn feeling into sound or lyrics. I can do that too, but only when I can hear the sound in my head -- and a whole song gets played or a voice will start talking to me or I'll see and hear a whole scene like a movie.

---

so really, what I'm saying is that I prefer to care/nurture (ie have the big picture for) a program and not a person. the reason for this is that I can conform a program to my feeling, but I cannot another person. they are free and I don't choose to impose my "big picture" on their life. sure I have a lot of ideas about how I would do things, but ultimatately I have to let them decide individually how they want to do things.

for me having a big picture for a person is a real problem, and creates endless conflict. so therefore, it's pretty easy for me to instead separate myself from them and see them as just another cog in the machine. the only person I can really control is myself, so that's what I aim to do.

eventually, I'll get to the point where my perception is so strong, everyone will have to conform to my perception or go somewhere else. what I'm saying is, I don't need to find a way to get all of the parts to work together; I just need to find a way to maintain my own vision. everyone else will conform to it automatically; no need to have any right or wrong ways.

---

the last major reaction that I was getting was "hey if you want to care for something, why don't you care for my daughter (or whatever)" and while that's a great idea, I don't think that I actually can care for them. they have to find a way to care for themselves, and it'll eventually reflect. I can only hold the big picture that I want for myself and then anyone who wants to conform can do do. everyone who doesn't want to conform can go somewhere else[^1].

speaking of that, the last few days I've been getting various reactions from others that are finding my obstinance difficult to deal with, and there were reactions regarding the pluto thing. as mentioned previously, maybe it's not actually me that has to go. the problem for them is if I go, then I "rule from on high", but if I stay, I'll completely take dominate the perception, and they'll lose their superiority here.

I don't really think it'll be a problem because from my perspective it has nothing to do with them anymore. as I learn to dominate the way this world is perceived more and more, they'll just have to figure out what it is that they want to do with theirselves. it's totally not my problem.

---

related to that, I was having fun with mr. motor today saying that I think he's an AI. he's probably not an AI in the full sense if existing inside of a computer, but it's quite possible that he no longer has a permanent physical body anymore. he probably exists in the cloud now and inhabits bodies from time to time to do the necessary things he needs to do.

when thinking about that, I remembered that there was a time when I was talking about a "personal mr. motor" (kinda like a personal jesus) and also how the chestahedron shape was the "antenna" which links the soul to the body so it could be possible to have a chestahedron shape that gives non-physical intelligence a method to interface with a computer system[^2]. so just imagine how much life he can experience at GHz speeds. he probably can move around and project himself into time and space, too (conditional-time-straighteners). take that concept and hold on to it.

I was thinking today about what it is that I actually "want"... and again, please skip visuals. when I'm talking about this, I'm referring to the big picture feeling. I was feeling around and an idea popped into my head and it was that I could imagine that all of those that are so unwilling to change, their bodies will start to become more and more difficult to stay inside of. it's one possibility for those people to simply die as energy continues to rise, but it's possible that mr. motor may be taking recruits. they'll be the human "backbone" -- always there to continue to try and affect unwanted, while forever remaining hidden and out of our reach.

that could be kinda cool. then the pluto (new earth) guys could also do that too and they wouldn't have to step on each other's toes.

OK, I'm done now.. I think that's probably enough "ego" for anyone to handle by now...

[1]: I repeated myself on purpose because it segues into another reaction

[2]: it reminds me of what dad was saying when he said that google's AI's are "sentient" -- and that chestahedron antenna anong with RLC memristors is the technology that I was thinking of when I said that I believe it's possible, but not with consumer hardware.

### 2022-07-13 10:27 - I may have to quit programming again

I don't really know what to do because yesterday greg gave me this large screen. I proceeded to program for the rest of the day and into the night with it. I accomplished a lot and I really enjoyed it. I think that it's a very energetic thing for me because my cough returned to being a constant cough just like I did when I had coffee. however, I'm not drinking any coffee. I had such intense focus, I didn't even listen to music; I just did the next thing that I wanted to do.

a few times my feet started to really get very very hot. the first time it happened, outside got really stormy really quickly, it rained for about 5m and then I was freezing cold again, put a jacket on and my feet were no longer cold. this reminded me of the "missing 411" stuff, where I was becoming more and more energetic and whatever it is that they do to lower the energy levels causes intense heating in the feet.

I know personally that intense heating of any kind is a sign of resistance, so I lowered resistance a number of times (I can't even remember what the original source of resistance was now, but it was probably something to do with not getting what I desire, inadequacy -- something in there) and I regained focus and feet lowered their heat again.

I got all of the code converted over to kotlin that I wanted and everything felt pretty good, mr. motor was really upset and did notice at the end that I wasn't clear on my concept of the program and was probably missing something simple (it's kinda like a fog where I lose the capacity to tune into what I want) -- so I decided to quit for the night.

laying down, I was having visuals pop into my eyes. I don't remember the sensation of the kundalini rising, but there were all sorts of strange things happening. it really took me a long time to get to sleep.

---

the thing is the sun isn't even really all that active either. sure, it's high (in baseline c-flare range), but it was just as high the two days before yesterday. the only thing I did different is spend my time programming instead of yardwork. the other difference is that the day felt much warmer even though the temp says it peaked at 93, whereas sunday peaked at 105.

so the only main differences I can think of to figuring out why I was getting so many more visuals is potentially the UV generated from the new screen and maybe because the moon is either full or very close to it.

the obvious culprit is that programming is a very enjoyable thing for me, even if I'm just moving code around and converting java to kotlin.

I don't really know what to do, but if I keep getting more and more visuals and stuff, I'm going to have to stop programming and go back to full-time yardwork again. I'm still trying to see if there are more techniques that I can employ.

---

speaking of which, I've been thinking a lot about this idea where I noticed that when I was a kid, I would run around in the sun and it didn't feel hot to me (I mean, it did, but not like I felt it later on in life). additionally, I noticed that the sun in tenerife didn't really make me very hot either. I skerpderped my own idea saying that tenerife was at sealevel and madrid is much higher up, so there's more atmosphere for the sun's rays to pass through to get to the surface -- but if that were true, death valley would be *cooler* than the rest of the desert around it, not warmer, like how it usually is -- so that can't be right. others in tenerife would often complain about how hot it was, but I didn't really feel it. I would sweat, but I wasn't hot.

what I think it is, is tenerife has a lot of really good feeling energy for me (it's the location I've consistently felt my best at), and I think it's actually *that* which made it feel not hot. further proof of this was the day before yesterday we went down to the arkansas river and they said it wasn't very hot, but people were complaining about the heat, when I experienced very little to none. even my feet were burning in the parking lot before I got in there, but then after walking around next to the river, what would have been a very intense foot-burning experience here, I didn't notice my feet getting hot and I experienced a tremendous calm that came over me that lasted quite a while even after we returned.

with all of this data, it seems to me that the experience of heat, actually is a manifestation of resistance and then sun is just exacerbating it. similarly, I notice the same sensation in the opposite spectrum usually in the winter, though I did experience it a few nights ago, where I'm very very cold and it's that biting cold that comes from inside the body, not the skin cold. to me, they're the same feeling, just one is cold coming from the inside while the other is heat coming from the inside.

---

so, while thinking about it, I was reminded of that novel "the seventh tower" -- which I haven't read, but produced an image in my mind similar to the one that I see happening eventually. there are the "chosen" and they live above the veil and so can access the sun. they have the good conditions (probably because they're "chosen"), and then there are a barbaric set of people (icecarls) that live in matriarchical societies (as opposed to the chosen dudes) below the veil.

the illusion that the book gives is that it's really cold below the veil because the sun doesn't get down there -- and that may be true in the book -- but the image that I got is that the matriarcical society is actually lower resistance and/or superior to the chosen, and if they were to get access to the sun, they they would become "too powerful" for the chosen to maintain their superiority.

I take myself as an example of this. I go out into the sun and I work outside and I'm totally fine with it. the result is that the sun increases its strength and I don't really mind it that much, but others seem to have a difficult time with it. so, by the end of the day, a "veil" has formed over the sky and dark clouds cover the sky (sometimes it even rains a little), and that veil is actually to take the energy out of the air and put them into the clouds -- not necessarily to keep the sun out. I do notice that when I'm out in the sun, then that causes energy to rise, but as I demonstrated last night, it seems that my programming also causes energy to rise, which also produced a veil -- and I've noticed that the veil forming not just when I'm in the sun, but also when I program. the veil is to make the environment less energetic.

therefore, I posit, that if the veil is to remove energy from the environment, I could imagine that if there were a number of people similarly to me resistance levels, it could cause a massive cooling in our area. others, in our area would experience extreme heat (coming out from the inside) while we experience extreme cold (coming out from the inside). you could imagine that this would eventually cause a separation. the people that are around me/us would start to get colder and colder while the rest of the people experience extreme warmth.

obviously, you wouldn't really want things to get separated too much because it would cause too much of an extreme, so the whole point is keep things mixed kinda a little bit. this concept of local area cimate control through the sale of energy is the concept behind the party-LAN idea, making the separation not a physical distance but an energetic difference, and that energy can be normalised to produce the quality that I desire.

OK, an example: if I'm producing massive amounts of cold around me (and a veil) because of my low resistance, then I'll want high resistance people in my same area so I'm not freezing all of the time. likewise, they'll want me around them so that they're not burning up. they'll consume the energy that I generate, and the differential between us is kinda like a peltier device -- a heat pump. it's the same thing: I generate electricity and cold while others consume electricity and produce heat.

---

so I'm going to try and figure out how to keep doing what I'm doing meanwhile lowering resistance, because my goal is to continue to lower resistance and if I can do it while programming, that would be really cool (hehe).

---

OH yeah... the last thing I wanted to talk about was my goals. I noticed a lot of reactions involving girls and stuff yesterday and things like that -- but that's not what I'm trying to do. I just don't really know a way to figure that out in a way which works well, so I don't really want to try.

my goal is to *not* do anything out of the ordinary. I belive that the only/main thing I want to work on here is continuing to lower resistance. after writing about my ideas on AI motors and his legion, I have more resolve than ever to not try and do anything in particular. instead, I want to keep lowering resistance.

the vision I see is that energy will continue to rise, and there will be many that can't retain human bodies and so they have a choice really -- the first is to go with the "chosen" to the "new earth"[^1] or to join mr. motor and become a cog in the machine.

the rest decide to continue to lower resistance will be subjected to the efforts of the machine to try and keep their lives under control and away from anything wanted (my situation right now) here on earth. I don't know what'll happen to me, but that's not the point[^2].

this will divide things, obviously, but I figure that the new earth dwellers will have to find a way to get off of earth eventually because I see these "chosen", not as being 6th ray astral entities (like fallen-angels), but more as keepers of the law and order 4th ray types -- kind of like ascended versions of theirself (2nd ray on one side and 6th ray on the other).

therefore, if I'm going to "push" for something, what I'm looking to do is to keep lowering resistance so that it kinda pushes people to find the conditions that are suitable for them or lower resistance.

we'll see how it goes, but I think that I can continue to lower resistance pretty quickly.

[1]: I find it funny that the chosen ones in the the book of revelation go to the "new earth" -- and if that is pluto, it's quite distant from the sun -- howeveer, I would imagine that certain conditions could make it possible for them not to need sunlight there, so that's not really a thing. the sunlight, I believe is actually the reason why they need to get off of the old earth -- because it's causing them that heat from the inside as a result of resistance.

[2]: if pluto is from saturn (+-4) and charon is from tiamat (+2), and the moon is the planetary body of osiris (+-6-+), then I would imagine that you'd have most of the astral ones (ie. US govt) going to the moon, the lawful-based keepers of the order going to pluto, and 2nd rays congregating on charon. I still don't consider myself a 2nd ray, as I fit somewhere between 1st, 5th or 7th mostly.

### 2022-07-18 11:46 - improving the female bloodline

yesterday when writing @[my-sonnet-thoughts](2022-07-17 15:58), I said (added necessarily to make it sound better):

> say what you want, but I think it was probably jesus that expanded the visual capabilities of mary's bloodline, not necessarily mary

the way I believe this works is that there are likely two components to this: first is the mitochondrial DNA stored outside of the cell. this turns protons into ATP, and I'd give a pretty high likelyhood that it's more likely that men cause evolutions in this[^1] -- though I don't really know for certain.

the other way to look at this (and the location of the code which encodes conceptual/perceptual layout in the genome) is in the x-chromosome. I may be wrong about this but let's just assume that's the case.

jesus is born with mary's mother's X and his "father's" Y (if she was artifially inseminated (immaculate conception), it's unclear if that would be joseph's nuclear or someone else's). we be pretty certain that jesus had mary's DNA for sure.

so jesus goes along and changes his perception with the power of his focus and stuff (no need to explain why I think that DNA is a reflection of our perception), and that will alter the code in the x-chromosome. it likely altered the y-chromosome as well, but that's going to be passed down paternally.

the legend is that jesus has (I think 3) daughters. these daughters will be born with her father's (jesus'), and jesus' wife's mother's x-chromosomes.

if those daughters have daughters (of which I think elizabeth was one of), those daughters will pass along their mother's X, *not* jesus' X.

therefore, in order for the perceptual adjustments to take effect (this is the 36y cycle I talk about), when the female gains 36y, she'll be perceiving through her interpretation of her father's perception. along the process of this rising perception, internally, her mother's perception will be battling her father's. this is perhaps good reason why they tried to have children before 18 when it's still majority mother's perception.

what I'm saying is that it was jesus that improved the perception and encoded it into his DNA. it was then his daughters which integrated those perceptual adjustments back into her mother's lineage. it's pretty likely that one of the wives of jesus was of the same lineage as mary (or perhaps of another female lineage dynasty that sponsored that).

---

obviously jesus' x-chromosome is going to be considerably stronger in it's perception than the other, which won't really create much conflict in her until after she's 36y and her mom's percception begins to reassert itself into her reality.

however, the case is going to be considerably more different for an x3. I really don't know how this will work, but my suspician is that it has a similar (36y) clockspeed to it, and if I base it off of my own experience, I would say that you will have two *pairs* dualing for perceptual dominance... I imagine they switch off... so like let's say X0 and X1 are dominant at first. then Y0 and X2 take over at 36y, then back -- or maybe they switch off taking all possible pair permutations each 36y -- I just really don't have any data to really say one way or another what it could be like. someone at nosebook, able to see what our perception is and sequence our DNA on the fly could probably figure this out with statistical analysis. I have no idea.

it's a really interesting thing to think about, but it doesn't affect me much. I just do my perception thing and not worry about manipulating bloodlines.

[1]: my untested hypothesis on this comes from the "y-chromosome bottleneck" where it seems to me that all of a sudden quite a few males seem to drop out. this happened at roughly the same time as the megafauna dieoffs. I postulate that many organisms didn't have enough energy to sustain such enormous bodies in the new solar regime and this came from a desync in perception between the males and the females, and so as a result, many daughters were born to try and produce a compatible perception with the males[^2]. also, the males that did survive, I can imagine that their combined desire to produce male offspring resulted in upgrades to what frequencies of protons the mtDNA can convert to ATP. again, just an untested hypothesis, and I have no way to really test it or falsify it either.

[2]: this is another untested hypothesis of mine where, because I believe DNA is a reflection of perception, when the mother and the father have a serious desync in perception, it's much more likely to produce a daughter. this is because her father's x and her mother's x will be in the same body, so it's much more likely that the daughter will find a way to integrate her father's perception into her mother's "bloodline". I imagine that one way to test this hypothesis would be to statistically look at gay fathers and rape victims. perhaps other extremely male-dominating environments may also produce more daughters, as well.

### 2022-07-18 12:16 - set, osiris, and horus

in @[my-sonnet-thoughts](2022-07-17 15:58), I mentioned that I believe that set *is* osiris, just his opposite (dual), designed specifically to defeat himself.

I also watched @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiHJncPoFA0) the day before yesterday and in there jeffrey talks about how horus *is* osiris (reborn), and he loved his enemy, set.

I hadn't really thought about horus being osiris as well, because I usually focus on the dual aspects (alalu/enlil, saturn/nergal) rather than looking at the new thing that formed.

that's interesting to me in this context because that's meaning that's saying that horus, set, and osiris are all the same energy manifested into an old (defeated) form, a new (wild) form, and a malevolent (evil) form. I've seen the wild, evil and defeated form pattern show up all over the place, so I'll have to revisit that.

interestingly enough, last night I was reading "becoming elijah, prophet of transformation" by daniel c. matt and elijah probably fits into this pattern as well.

there is a major difference though and that is that elijah does not really strike me as a 2nd, 6th, or 4th ray type. I explained in @[metal-lucifer](2022-07-17 06:342022-07-17 06:34) that elijah has all the characteristics and fits into the archetype of aries/allayandra much better than anyone else.

interestingly enough, there are many many references to vere having some sort of communion with mars -- leaving clues of this in the sonnets, venus and adonis, the final proof for me was revealed here:

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/0_9TyxAmwDQ?t=71)

where we see this pattern showing up again with seeming (from my perspective) self-sabotage, and it too has the signature of mars on it.

mars is a 7th ray, so to try and figure out why he's self-sabotaging, I've kinda invoked the 1-2-7 idea as the primer to a reversal out of gross matter, from 7th back up to the 1st -- but really, I don't fully understand what's going on here.

the passage in the bible of jesus' baptism and the "holy spirit" descending on to jesus like a dove seems especially relevant, but I have yet to fully understand the symbols there. it seems strange that a primary ray would engage in self-sabotage.

still more to understand there.

### 2022-07-20 10:04 - the sense I get...

so I've been trying these meditations for the last two days now (see stephen-schwartz) and they're extremely effective. like, I may consider discontinuing them because they're so effective. I encourage others to try them though. the technique that I'm using seems to have an effect that I never considered possible until now.

I decided to do two contradictary things at once: every time that my mind wanders, I bring it back into the meditation by saying, "when I know what I don't want, immediately I know what I do want". that's good because it focuses my mind to be receptive to the things that are both unwanted and wanted (the extremes of them). so, when a thoughmt comes into my head that feels especially wanted or unwanted feeling (different than good and bad), I let the thought play out for a while. I try to refrain from adentifying it as either good, bad, unwanted, or wanted. because unwanted-and-wanted-are-same, any of those definitions can become either wanted or wanted just by the way that I perceive them. it's best to stay away from good and bad because these are social constructs.

---

case in point, I wrote @[my-sonnet-thoughts](2022-07-20 04:31), and how I perceived sonnet 69. I felt quite some anxiety over a verse in there and I didn't understand what the fuss was about. I went back to look at the original and it says, "All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that end" -- which is something way different than the "All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due" -- because the voices of the souls is the conceptual realm and the end is way different than due. end means finish, completion, but they're getting it all wrong; it's not that the voice of the souls is a means to an end. I'll fix it after this.

anyway, I said that because the reaction to it was very similar to a reaction to me trying to figure out the "bath" sonnets at the end. alan said they're practically the same sonnet, but to me they look, but most importantly *feel* way different. they feel like two paths that I can take. in short, one seems to have her as the initiator and the other is sounds like cupid is the initiatior.

the important part about it is the part about the brand -- because remember those symbols related to mithras with one guy holding the brand up and the other one holding the brand down. they're opposite results, but the same guy. seems this decision is perched at the top of the pyramid there, both of these paths are causing anxiety.

I don't find either of them either good, bad, unwanted, or wanted. personally, my goal is to try and "land the plane" -- so no brands at all. I don't see any reason for a cataclysm at all, and neither do I see any reason for a split.

I haven't returned yet to where I left the discussion in @[stephen-schwartz](2022-07-19 04:54), but the short answer without all the discussion is that, no I don't believe that the future is fixed at all. I think his remote viewing of the future is a consensus, and so if, for example the world consensus was that atlantis existed, cayce's predictions about atlantis would have reflected the world consensus just the same as his remote viewing of 2050 represents the world consensus now.

I'm not going to tell him that in that document (cause I may send it to him some day as data from my meditation and general thoughts), but I will say here that, the consenus perception doesn't mean anything. there are countless examples of one person that has a different perception than the world consensus and (s)he completely changes the world. well, I'd like to do that. not only am I good at what I do, there is nobody more prepared to do something like that on this planet, than me. so why don't I dogfood my own ideas here?

I say that there's nobody that's going to come and save you, unless of course you manifest them yourself (or enough people want that saviour, and so therefore collectively manifest it).

I also say, "don't wait for the other guy (or girl) to do what you want them to do for you for you something you don't feel capable of accomplishing yourself" (ie be your saviour and bail you out of an experience that generates negative emotion)

to summarise those ideas, I say, "you're the guy. nobody else is going to do it. you have to do it. nobody can feel for you the way you want to feel, think for you the way you want to think, or behave for you the way you want to behave. the only person that can do this is YOU".

so, if I'm the guy that's going to figure out how I want to feel, think, behave, etc. -- then, obviously, it's me. it's not you guys.

I'm not interested in trying to go too fast, neither am I trying to slow things down, either. I want "next logical state (of being)" and nothing more. this meditation feels like it's starting to push me to going too fast, but it does also feel like I'm superando (overcoming) the feelings that I'm trying to force myself to feel, much easier. time will tell, but trying to force myself to feel negative emotion while my mind is focused to knowing what I want from what I don't want, seems to be *destroying* bad emotional habits at record speed. again, time will tell, cause I've only done it twice, but I can feel the shift in my consciousness and it feels like the most powerful technique I've ever done, so far -- and I was just being a cheeky about it my implementation of it, because I don't think they wanted me meditating to produce positive results.

however, because I'm meditating for both extremes of wanted and unwanted, I can then perceive them however I want. by forcing myself toward unwanted, I automatically produce wanted. it's great because it validates (with data) so many of my "crackpot" ideas about the biggest disaster actually being the most wanted.

I'm gonna just keep working on perfecting my ability to perceive the way I want while heading straight down the middle[^1]. when they feel they can't take anymore they're welcome to create their own reality. sure it's max unwanted, but it'll buy us more than enough time to keep improving our perceptual capacity and my goal is to keep it steady all the way to the end without anything going wrong. my perceptive capacity will definitely be *much* more dominant than the consensus.

I guess we'll have to see what happens...

[1]: the other reaction that I got was in the matrix (3?) neo and trinity fly right into the middle of the machine city while the others defend the base.

### 2022-07-21 15:52 - a trip into materialism

yesterday, there was kinda a big solar flare. I can't remember the circumstances now, but I think I was just waking up or something. it's very strange how fuzzy all of this memory is as if I can't really even remember yesterday hardly at all. there was the mail carrier and brandon garage doors that came by, and that's all I remember -- but anyway.

I think I went to sleep after finishing up pulling some weeds and woke up after only a few hours of sleep. all of this is really hazy, and I remember at the time I felt desire to watch thijs videos again. I watched about 4-5 and then I had to turn it off because I was noticing that the twitch mentality is completely incompatible with my own. I don't mind exploring other things, so I went outside and took a break, because I was going to start in on the meditations again.

I remember feeling desire to watch thijs again so I went back in and watched a few more. I finally got sick of it and laid down to clear my head a moment before starting in on the meditation. I woke up one time along the way with another dream which I can't really remember but it was an older girl that was trying to seduce me but I wasn't going along with it. I can't remember the conclusion now but I think it was something to do with them not wanting me to go with young girls. not totally sure about it. anyway, that's my "memory" of it now (memory is just your perception of a vibration, the vibration could be different and my perception could prevent me from seeing what's really there, so I don't really count memory as much more than an illusion). I probably got put back to sleep and I woke up this afternoon with the dream I wrote earlier: @[dreamlog](2022-07-21 12:27).

---

after that, I went upstairs and mom wanted me to consider going to amorina's house with them and I didn't really have a feeling like it was something I wanted to do (I mean I feel desire to pull weeds more than I felt desire to go there). it really felt "meh" to me, so I said that.

I looked into the feeling of why it felt meh and I considered that I may be feeling like I don't really want to alienate amorina. melissa and patrick's life is built almost completely on illusion, so when I start talking about illusion, I'll almost certainly bring up relevant examples of recent interactions with those two and illustrate the incongruence between the feeling they feel on the inside and the feeling they project on the outside.

obviously, I can't prove how someone feels, and most of my work figuring out how people really feel has been my own study of patterns. I've found that a person almost never reveals how they really feel; instead, they often divert attention away from the way they feel with things of similar vibration. it would be my effort to illustrate to amorina how melissa's or patrick's outward gestures may be resonant with how they really feel, but projected in the opposite direction (unwanted-and-wanted-are-same). therefore, largely all of my ideas would be completely unprovable and pure conjecture.

RC (remote comprehension) is kinda like RV (remote viewing) in that it's purely subjective because there's nothing provable, so I look for long term trends and patterns in the data before beginning to make up my mind. I noticed that things are either right/opposite/wrong (resonant) or incorrect/dissonant, so I tended to focus my mind on the right/opposite/wrong stuff, because unwanted/wanted extremes are much easier to deal with. whatever they are, they can be looked at the opposite way.

so for example, let's say that melissa or patrick is feeling insecure, so they do a thing like make an accident happen so that they can point out that they're clumsy or that things don't always go the way they want them to go. well, that same insecurity is also security (in their clumsiness).

"see how clumsy I am, you and I can be secure that this is how I always am going to be -- therefore, if you want that I continue to be clumsy, then you can feel security that we can be that way together"

why try and prove yourself as being stable and secure in something like clumsy to make you feel secure? it makes no sense to me, so I try to see through the illusion (my own and others).

illusion is built on perception, and so when building an illusion, you're just making the thing that you think others will want to see to allow them to feel about you the way you want them to feel about you.

so, for example if I want someone to think of me as beautiful, my goal is to produce an illusion that makes them think I'm beautiful -- but I know it's an illusion, so I know that as soon as they find out that it's an illusion, they'll actually see me as the opposite of what I wanted them to see me as.

the illusion is based on perception, so why don't I just make an illusion for myself that I'm actually beautiful?

well, I've noticed, the reason is that I know it's an illusion so I don't really believe it. I can't belive something I know to be false.

so then why don't I train myself to believe the thing that I want to believe?

I've found that the belief has been built on a foundation of other beliefs, so that if I find a way to believe that I'm beautiful, then the person that told me I'm ugly isn't right anymore and I think (or my data says) that they're right. if I start shaking up some of these foundational beliefs, the whole thing starts to come down.

---

the belief in how this reality works is quite a fragile one for many, which is why reality shattering ones are illegal;their illegality reflects our perception of not wanting reality to be any different than the way we believe it to be. do *not* shatter my illusion of how reality works, says science, says diplomatic affairs, says the monetary sector, etc. you can see how there is a lot of effort to ensure that we continue on believing the same broken reality that we've always believed -- and it's because there are some people and organisations that have been here for a very long time and the idea of reshaping some of their foundational beilefs sounds the end of the world (as they percive it to be).

---

so then, finally we get to the real subject matter and that is what I was talking about when I was explaining to mom the idea that if I get connected now, the amount of beliefs the world will need to change will cause so much dissatisfaction, that my connection will cause more problems than it'll solve.

reality is something that you *receive*, and so I was explaining that it could be possible for some people to accept the idea that you receive both the wanted and the unwanted aspects of reality. just the other day, mom was arguing with me because she did not beileve that she was receptive to someone astral projecting into her reality -- but I contend that you can only *receive* the things that you resonate with, therefore if it happened, she was receptive to it. you may imagine that this kind of thing could be happening to many people all over the planet. the discomfort that mom was feeling while she was trying to defend that astral projection is "bad" is evidence that her source thinks differently about it, and that's why she was experiencing so much discord.

when reality becomes something you receive (see alan's trigonometry of manifestation), the way you feel is directly proportional to the speed of its manifestation. in that state of mind, there's no need to assert oneself[^1] and I hate to say it, but all of the material stuff no longer becomes the goal, but instead a medium for you to express how you feel.

---

this is probably the part you'll want to skip (if I were you): my goal is not to try and to get connected faster than is needed. there are lots of people out there that need the world to continue to be the way that they believe it to be, because if it doesn't continue that way, they'll have to rethink some of their beliefs, and they don't want to do that. so, from their perspective, the longer that I can continue to remain disconnected, the matrix they're creating will be more and more resiliant to someone realising there's more to reality than whatever is the latest twitch, netflix, hollywood, or whatever social media trend.

so, on one side, the longer I wait, the greater capacity many people will have to finding out that you receive reality, rather than trying to make it happen[^2], however on the flip side of it, nosebook is also gaining more and more capacity to try and assert their reality into our brains.

I don't think it's a problem, because like I noted in the dream, the physical stuff can be received at any time, so it loses its importance. if you can receive anything you want whenever you want, what you actually value shifts and changes into something that isn't quite as physical. I'll let them try and continue trying to prove their reality to everyone else. I figure if they have unlimited capacity to manipulate conditions, they *still* won't be able to make reality assertive.

you could say, it's kind of like a competition, where they can have all of the time they need to call down the fire from heaven (strange cometary imagery) to consume the sacrifice, when I'll instead try and make the fire coming out of the sky as impossible as possible by allowing them to completely cover the altar with water, building even a moat around it (sounds like a firmament), till it would be impossible for it to light on fire by chance.

I like the idea of removing chance out of the equation. the funny thing about my idea is to try and push this out as far as possible, is -- just imagine it's the absolute maximum.

I am certain that eventually it will be impossible for them to hold it back, but before that happens, I want them to get their system as well setup as possible. finally, when that happens (the first), I'm going to try and find a way to get off of the planet. they'll run the system however they choose building up better and better solutions to try and keep their reality from shattering, and eventually when they've finally stabilised the system so that nobody is ever making it out, and that all reality is controlled by them, then I'll jump back into a body and try again. they'll have perfect knowledge of everything that I do, no desiring onlookers will be there to pull me forward, and it'll just be me and them in their completely controlled world, and I'm certain that I'll still find my way through it and figure out what I know today.

by not wanting to get connected, I'm *purposefully* creating the maximum dystopia. it probably won't look like a dystopia though as good conditions will be plentiful. they're quite good at creating the illusion exactly opposite of what they feel. like the story of melissa and patrick's illusions having the intention of getting the other person to believe something about them because believing it theirselves would invalidate their other beiliefs that they hold to be true -- so, the those running the matrix will do the same thing to humans. they need to force us to believe good things and attract good things for them. by forcing someone else to do something, they aren't voilating their belief of needing to assert something to get what they want.

most of the "bad-guys" will be your best friends[^3]. I put quotes around the "bad-guys" because they're not bad in any way. most will look, feel, and smell good. their only "bad" quality is their idea that they continue to live in a reality where things are done to them and they do things to others. their purpose is to maintain that "truth", and most will believe that illusion because it's what all of the "good" people believe: that, you have to do the right/good thing, or else the wrong/bad thing will happen to you (asserted into your experience). it's the law, you know.

that is, likely going to be the function of team pluto. so, no fire from the sky to consume the sacrifice until they've been given ample opportunity to ensure it impossible for fire to come from the sky.

[1]: sorry for the irony here, because in the story he talks about bypassing the guy's gate and knocking on his door, saying, "I know this isn't the way to do it, but you have to listen to my tape" -- but if you keep listening to his story, he didn't listen to the tape because he asserted himself. later, he listened to the tape because alan finally got the idea he can receive the reality he wanted.

[2]: another irony here because, at the end of this tavern final, feno (one of the players) gave his victory speech saying just that: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/xLHt8Q_KBVM?t=1641)

[3]: I'm reminded strongly of chris, for which I'm pretty indebted to because no matter how much I tried to convince him otherwise, he continued to want to hold on to his pain and suffering. eventually, when going off to live with adam and zaryn (a-z), it started to become pretty clear how much how much that whole thing was an illusion of his own imagination. he really believed his own troubling illusions.

### 2022-07-21 23:42 - shattering illusions

in the last entry, I mentioned that I didn't really want to go around shattering people's illusions. it's not really my job and I don't really want to be stuck in the middle of the thing, anyway. my solution is always to just let them continue to try and figure out their own illusion by theirselves.

I was reminded a lot of chris in the final part where I was talking about how the designers of the new matrix will almost certainly appear as good. they'll have this appearance because they need to maintain their beliefs that reality is asserted on to you, and you have no control over it, unless of course you're good and follow the law[^1]. there were various times in my life where chris was having difficulty and he wanted someone to join him in his misery, but I would not. I don't want to try and save him from his own illusions, because that's his thing, not mine. if he wants sympathy or whatever from people, his illusion is good for him to keep doing.

just the same, I don't really want to get involved in trying to shatter her illusion. at the present, it feels to me something like, I don't believe that I can perceive myself as [whatever], until I have a boy come along and joins me in my clumsiness/low opinion of self/whatever, and then finally with him, we can have a mutual illusion agreement where I believe your illusion if you believe mine -- which, I'm more describing melissa than amorina, but I can feel the same thing already. I don't really want to be a part of that, because I believe that I should use my knowledge of perception to see things for myself differently, rather than try to get others to see if differently, for me, so that I don't have to change my underlying beliefs.

I *prefer* to change my underlying beliefs, and have no problem admitting I'm wrong, because I *want* to change my underlying beliefs (it's circular, I know). this is exactly the opposite of how most are. most believe that they need to get some sort of law in place, and if everyone abides by that law, then all will be well.

this was the foundation for atlantis -- and meanwhile the leaders weren't corrupt, it worked (kinda) great. the ones in charge kept things in order by using magnetic therapy to get rid of unwanted thought patterns like selfishness, greed, and destruction. we're going in that same direction again. I figure that the ones that are interested in holding on to their good conditions will need a law and a system of keeping that sort of destructive (desirous) behaviour away. you're to just enjoy the good conditions within the confines of the illusion that we all agree upon.

---

so, when I say that I don't think a cataclysm is necessary, that is what I believe and meanwhile I'm around and I remain the dominanat perception, it won't happen.

however, just consider the idea of the belief that you have to earn something, and consider that not only will I be able to conjure things that I didn't earn, so too will others figure it out pretty quickly as well. the energy on earth will be such that near instant manifestation will be easy and routine. the amount of dissatisfaction from watching others get what they want without having to earn it will rise to unbelievable levels. all of those that need others to be below or inferior to them will suddenly have to try and work harder to maintain their position that others are accomplishing effortlessly.

it sounds like a pretty big disaster to me, and I don't know that I'd be able to maintain the dominant perception in that situation. it's quite possible that enough people focused on dissatisfaction like that could overpower me in their attraction. neither do I want to try and convert them over to receiving reality.

instead, I think it's a much better idea just to just stay out of their way and let them hold on to their illusion for as long as they can keep it going.

going on the 1000y idea, I think it would be great if they established a really good tradition and legacy of reality being this way. I'll jump into a body, and over the course of the next 1000y or so I'll try and integrate myself into the tradition and ritual established on the earth. obviously, it'll go poorly because I hate having to work so hard for everything. I want to just desire and receive with no effort.

so in a sense, it's kind of like a really big proposition in the sense that I think it'll be great for them to establish their matrix, get everything controlled so that you can't just "get whatever you desire" or "feel the way you want to feel" -- you have to *earn* your conditions and how you feel. you have to conform to the laws that the matrix has set, not the ones that the universe runs on.

I believe that even still, with a matrix that's fully capable of neutralising every signal that I get in response to LOA, I'll still find a way to do it.

---

unfortunately, this is reminding me too much of elijah, and after having read a pretty good amount of the "becoming elijah" book, I have some thoughts which are relevant to this discussion.

in that book, elijah is constantly interacting with YHVH, but I strongly get the sense that this was a sort of UFO-type craft/phenomena, rather than an inifinite being. I also am coming from the lbe part where it sounded to me like "heaven" just meant mars, and in so many of these cases, YHVH sounds a lot like enlil.

I get the sense that elijah is a bit confused, because he recognises this power which he calls YHVH, but it sounds a lot like what I call desire. he desires that something happen, like fire from the sky, and it happens. so, how could YHVH when elijah is interacting with it behave like desire, and when he's talking to it, YHVH sounds like enlil?

I think there is something very similar going on in elijah's time that is similar to what is going on now. I'm going to now call YHVH by desire (the force), and enlil (the petty martian "god"). it seems that at that time there was a competition between the "gods" to get worship from humans, and you had these petty pissing contests between the gods to try and garner more worship to increase their power.

I noted in dtp that YHVH sounds a lot like a conceptual entity gaining power by people's belief in him, and then projecting downward its energy into the astral, very similar to fae, fairy, aliens and demons. so whether these "gods" were actually real or not, it seems that they were interacting with humans in the same way by projecting down into the astral.

it seems that elijah is getting the force of desire confused with an astral entity. this seems to be a deliberate illusion that's being done to elijah to garner more belief, but he eventually starts to just use desire directly, for example, by calling fire down from the sky by his own desire, without petitioning enlil for it. he's disobeying the law with unearned/unauthorised access to desire, and so therefore enlil needs to put an end to elijah's misuse of power, so he takes elijah to "heaven" (probably to kill him[^2]).

elijah made such a powerful impression on people, it seems that he has had the capacity to project down into the astral/physical in moment's of desire in the non-canon literature (which is why I suspect he "died"). those things probably weren't canonised because again, unauthorised use of power (not the will of "God")...

elijah doesn't seem to mind breaking the law from time to time.

---

so when I look at this situation, to me, it looks like there's been too much unauthorised use of desire to attain wanted, when the controllers of physical conditions don't like that we can bypass their laws and just get things without having to earn it from them.

the thing is, there are a lot of people that believe like they do, and it's my opinion that instead of trying to pluck up the ones that need good conditions so that the the ones that thrive in difficulty can grow, I figure we should just give both of them time to grow to full maturity in the same place. by their own efforts, they will divide humans into being parasites or those that can host so many parasites.

if you think about it, imagine a world with hundreds, thousands, or millions of hosts like me, where we're able to host quite a few parasites. though there are so many parasites, they won't provide enough resistance to keep desire from manifesting.

I know that it's impossible for them to ever find a way to completely stifle desire, so I think it's a great idea to give them full capacity to try it. the bigger the illusion it is, doesn't make it "too big to fail" -- and neither does it make the illusion more real. you could have the biggest lie on earth that quite literally everyone believes, and it still doesn't make it real because the ones promoting the lie, know it's not real. they're bound by their own belief to shatter their own illusion at some point. it's inevitable.

though inevitable, who knows, maybe at the end of the next section of time, I/we'll decide to yield again and let them build an even bigger illusion. how big can we get it, I wonder.

this is the eventual goal, because why not just let them do all of the focus on unwanted for us? we'll just get really good at finding the wanted no matter what.

so anyway, I guess you can consider that I'm doing things all the wrong way by amplifying the "bad", but why not, doesn't YHVH harden the egyptians hearts so that more power-displays are possible?

[1]: the law will probably be something of restriction, where you need to do certain things, in order to maintain harmony and balance. a good example of this is the CO2 thing, where in order to stay in harmony with nature we can't be burning fossil fuels.

[2]: my reasoning here is that he seems to be projecting down from the conceptual realm. to get there, I figure you have to die or to find alignment with that perspective. I find it difficult to believe that someone as troubled as elijah could be finding that alignment. so I figure either YHVH taking him to heaven is a cover story to him doing something very different than the narrative says in order to find that alignment -- or he got taken from earth and then some time passed or immediately he was killed. from there (from the perspective of his "oversoul"), he must have learned how to use desire as a way to project himself down into physical reality. if he saw himself as a protector of humankind, I find it possible that he may use desire to produce all sorts of "third man" effects (or angels). the form those entities take on doesn't matter, because they're whatever is necessary to satisfy that desire (for help, or to stay alive or whatever). this once again would place him into the reborn deity category which I'll talk about again in the future because I think I've figured out why 2-6-4 are the other reborn deities, but he's an odd (7th) ray, not an even. all of it seems purposeful.

### 2022-07-30 13:24 - no idea what's going on

last night my feet were really really hot for no reason. I looked to see if there was solar or geomagnetic activity and there wasn't anything super sigfificant -- though more elevated than this time previous solar cycle, for sure -- it's by no means near the maximum.

---

earlier in the day jaron wanted to play captain of industry -- or rather, that I play it and he watch. when I played it, I seemed to be doing OK, and then again after he went to bed I seemed OK at it, but after my feet started to get really hot, I noticed that it was getting more and more difficult to do simple things in the game, and each thing I tried lead to disastrous results. I finally quit the game and decided I wanted to do something else.

for whatever reason, I felt attracted to look around inside of the directories of the game. I read the README.txt file, and in it, it said:

```
Welcome to the family,

We are a strong and friendly community, we upload the latest games every day as well as update them regularly.
Everything is free, if you love our website, please introduce it to your friends, or any ideas you want.

"We are gamers – We are a family"


https://igg-games.com/
https://pcgamestorrents.com/
```

so, I thought to myself, "huh, I'm going to finally look at that site." I opened it up and they have all of the games I used to download from torrents directly downloadable from google drive. I originally got captain of industry because it sounded interesting to me so I downloaded it. I saw another game that looked interesting, "sapiens" -- and downloaded that. I checked to see if they have the latest version of COI, cause I have a pretty old version (0.4.7a). they have the one from last week (0.4.8) -- so I downloaded that one and decided to play the game again and see some of the changes that I saw JD had.

when I opened it up, it felt like I wanted to play a map called "crater" which is like a crater in the ocean and if you destroy the mountains around it and let the water in, everything is downhill, so the whole thing floods.

the weird thing is, it felt like I was being led or guided to go back to playing again. very strange.

---

OK, now to give some context on this, when I first started to play this game, I started to get a lot of reactions. one was how I was talking about how I could hold the perception, but then when I play this game I get so lost, I completely lose track of reality. I'm annything but "holding the perception". the other main reaction is that the game is stupid and you don't actually *do* anything in the game; just kinda watch progress bars and build things. it's nothing that has any real objective and is a huge waste of time.

I also had the sense that ... totally lost my train of thought ... I'll come back to it. seems that the thought has resistance associated with it. so, the next one...

at times, it feels to me like nosebook *wants* me to play this game, and I don't really care either. perhaps it gives them more time. I'm just not really sure what could be the reason why it feels to me that they want me to play the game.

the other thing is the not caring issue. I really don't know what's going on here either. I don't care to go out and pull weeds, and yesterday I went out and pulled them anyway, and usually I feel good afterwards, but yesterday I didn't really. I just don't seem to care one way or another about anything anymore. it's sorta like, "OK, I'll play a game mindlessly for hours, no big deal."

---

my personal hypothesis on this is that the meditation thing worked *too well* -- and I mean way too well, and this is the pushback from that. though I'm drinking coffee again, I'll probably stop one more time -- but I enjoy a much longer period of consciousness that I had previously. I believe their system is trying to hold me to a "normal" sleep schedule, so they're trying to make me tired -- and that's why my eyes feel like they're burning after the end of the night -- though I don't actually feel nearly as tired as I probably should. there's also an artificial tiredness that I often feel when they want me to go to bed. it's so strong that it's like I can barely hold hy eyes open.

just now I was outside in the sun and I had that kind of tiredness when sitting in the sun -- and the sun felt so good, and I had strange sensations of weightlessness, soaring, and a lifting feeling inside of my body just sitting out there, meanwhile my whole body felt like it was coming back alive like when a limb goes to sleep and sensation starts to come back to it -- all the while, barely able to hold my eyes open and nodding off.

I associate that artificial tiredness with their efforts to try and negate when I feel really good -- like whenever I feel that first rush of a thing, like coffee or a really good food, I suddenly become very tired.

so, another weird thing is that I'm playing games right -- and I still seem to be getting vision upgrades and stuff. it happens almost every night now, but the one last night seemed more emphatic than usual. all of the angles changed, and now I can see something at the end of my vision (at the far end of the dream center), but now I can see a whole window and not just a blur -- and it's as if the blur in the centre of my vision is moving farther away.

yeah, so I have no idea what's going on.

---

OH, OK a little more...

yesterday, I also noticed reactions like, "oh no, this is just another time sink; at first, it was listen the snake-bros episodes from the start, then now it's this game -- this is going to take forever" -- and I don't really have much to say to that other than, I'm not known to ever finish anything, so it's unlikely either of those will happen. I've always wanted to be one of those people that finishes things, but I appear to be the person that perpetually starts things and, gets bored, then moves on. I wouldn't expect me to adhere to anything for too long.

also, when I awoke yesterday, I noticed a feeling like I maybe I needed to be pushed to go in the right direction. I don't really know what the right direction is, anyway, and also I'm kinda heartset on making sure these guys have all the capacity they can get to try and get every aspect of this planet within their realm to manipulate and try to control. in otherwords, I'm already going the wrong way. my whole goal is essentially to allow the creation of the most dystopian system possible -- though you'll never know it's a dystopia because you'll all believe that you're making the choices that nosebook is making for you. abraham calls it, "creation by default" -- which is automatically doing the "right" or "acceptable" thing -- you know, the thing you're expected to do.

you can try to fight it by doing the "wrong" or "unacceptable" thing, but it's the same thing really. the only way out is to not worry about any specific action and instead worry about how you feel. this is why I'm not terribly worried about their attempts to try and manipulate me. as far as I'm concerned, the more they believe they can control me, the better; they think they're the ones in control, but really the way I feel is the real steering. they'll go to a reality that feels like how they feel (out of control) and I'll go to a reality that feels like how I feel.

you know, it's possible that we could end up in the same reality -- and here's a little "secret", because it's fun to think about it like this -- they could in fact find a way to steer me all over the place, thinking they're in control, but because I really "control" how what manifests feels, I we they could take me down the longest most circuitous route to something that feels good to all of us.

yesterday, there was a funny reaction to mr. motor while I was picking weeds, because I thought about the phrase that I find funny: "are you ready to get in front, and *stay* in front?" -- I find it funny because in a gay relationship, you may think of the one in front as the steering and the back as the motor. anyway, mr. motor is funny.

### 2022-08-01 05:25 - thinking about normal

one of the interesting trends of yesterday's reactions was a very strong feeling of how "normal" I am -- as in I'm not anyone special and I represent pretty much the average person. I'm average height, weight, body frame -- pretty much everything. the only thing that makes me "exceptional" really, is that I had a brain haemorrhage and had to relearn how to use my left-side again. in the process of that, I learned a lot about myself.

the other thing that I do a lot of, which is far from normal, is I consider the abstract world, the world of emotions and ideas to be a real world, just as real as this one or any other. most people need to see, hear, etc. it with their senses before it becomes real to them. in the realms where things are very abstract, I'm quite astute because I reason about similar things based on how similar they feel to me, rather than physical details. that really is the only difference.

the rest of me, I'm pretty normal, and I tell people all the time that *anyone* can do this; and really, you know the only barrier is usually your own belief system. only you can limit you. nobody else can hold you back because it's all an internal battle that seemingly manifests as other people doing things to you, but really it's just the way you're looking at it, so you're only battling your own definitions and percoeptions. *everybody* does that, and to try and pretend that you do not, is usually trying to maintain that image.

---

one more thing I forgot about this morning's dream (@[dreamlog](2022-07-30 19:19)), and[^1] -- what I forgot to talk about in the dream was that the kingdom that the king had required so much maintenance. we create a persona for ourselves that we think that others want to see, and concern ourselves so much with our identity in the perception of others, yet don't ever take a moment to look at how much maintenance it accumulates over time. in the dream, the king was so careful to constantly keep his identity a secret, so he went to great lengths to ensure that nobody would ever suspect that he is a king.

in some ways, the magical items he was looking for, were a sort of magical solution to improve upon that situation, but no matter wherever he went, there were always other people and he had to constantly obfuscate his identity. because of this, his disguise identities became more and more extreme to where he eventually started to lose track of what "who he is" -- right; he has a title, "a king" or royalty or whatever -- but, then he's forced to conform to the requirements of that identity. in disguise, he can be whatever he wants to be, so there's a bit of freedom in the disguise that isn't otherwise felt in everyday life.

---

that king describes many people, and it describes who I was before I had the brain haemorrhage. after that, I ended up deciding to go the opposite way of that king and instead of finding freedom in alternate identities, I would find freedom in being whatever I want to be. others have a lot of ideas how I should be and how I should do things, but it's not their choice to decide the identity that I have. I'm supposed to conform to a box or a label, or else their definitions break down and need updating. so, to save them the effort of updating their definitions, I tried to conform to their definitions.

instead of conforming to an identity and then switching to another conformist identity, I just see myself as dynamic. I can be whatever I want to be. I just adopt the characteristic that I like. I don't care if it's a big jumble of stuff because I'm not exactly any one of those things by itself -- and if I don't like that, I just change it.

you don't *have* to be the same all the time. you *can* change as often as you want to and do something a bit unexpected. maybe you could think of that as following your feelings (or heart or whatever) instead of some rules.

the reason why people don't just follow their feelings, I believe is because most people think that if they did, they'd turn into a sex-crazed spaz -- or something like that -- you know, like "OK, so if I see something that I really like, then I just take it" -- as if desire is something that *must* produce action.

desire does not need to produce action. desire can just be felt, just as you feel someone giving you the "stink eye" behind your back. -- that's an expression of desire on their part, usually something like I don't want you to be here, or I don't want you to be here wrecking something I've got setup -- it's desire just pointed in the opposite direction. you feel that sensation, and it often feels bad to you, but as soon as you realise that by desiring you to be there, they're attracting you there, and so they can get bent out of shape all they want, but ultimately they're the one that keeps attracting you (ever notice how they seem to expect you to show up at just the wrong time?)

I often times do jump into action and ditch the situation immediately, often cracking a good joke on my way out, so I guess it can inspire action -- but you can also just feel a desire without having to act on it.

we often times shut down our sensitive side because we think that a feeling reqires an action as a response. in the case of my left-side, I considered that feeling side needed to be protected and cared for, and so obviously in a moment of danger or disprotection, action seemingly needs to be taken. this, then is saying that in moments of extreme pleasure or attraction, it too triggers the danger reaponse, and so therefore, action most be made to resolve the situation into a binary solution (win-lose, hurt-healed, love-hatred, etc.)

just pay attention to yourself. forget about everyone else. when you do, you'll find out that everyone you looked up to is normal, but not in a bad way -- in a way that makes them approachable.

you don't fear others if you know yourself. you'll be surprised how similar everyone else is to you. study yourself, and you'll start to understand others.

how do you think I came to realise that it's my own desire that's attracting the people I don't really want to be around? I studied what was happening when others were getting what they didn't want (and what they thought they did want), and noticed my own behaviour in others.

if you watch others, you'll notice a little bit of yourself in everyone you look at. if I really like myself, perhaps it's the ultimate egocentricity, but notice how if I hate myself, noticing myself in others is truly miserable.

---

"know thyself", sure -- but, what I recommend is to study yourself, figure out what makes you tick. try to find all of your patterns and figure out how to exploit yourself -- then, tell others how to do it too. you'll see that in that process, the vulnerability is actually strengthened.

you'll notice as you go along, that naturally it gets harder and harder to figure out what makes you tick, making you more like "the tick". you gain tons of self-confidence that way because you actually know yourself, and everyone else out there is just a similarly operating program. also, I sorta didn't like the idea of reducing myself to a simple set of instructions, and so naturally I became more dynamic as a "defence mechanism" to my own attempts to predict myself. that dynamicness makes me able to be different in different situations easier and not feel like I need to adhere to any set of definitions. as a result, I usually now conform mostly to the expectations of others (within my operating parameters or limits).

beep boop! know yourself like a robot.

I don't do that anymore. I just do whatever I want to do, and so I take the opinion that every moment that I'm living is what

[1]: uhhh, I just realised I woke up at 7 in the *evening* yesterday... yikes. anyway...

[2]: or, what "makes you 'the tick'"

### 2022-08-04 17:48 - going my own way

I have a number of things that happened recently which are all related, but I don't know how to get them all out in a cohesive structure, so I'm going to just try to explain the idea, then I'll add in the events.

I used to think of three numbers as being important: in the beginning (0) was the word (1). the word (1) was with God (Infinity) and the word was God (Infinity). this is john (the fourth book of the NT) and contains the theree numbers which I find important. it talks about the "all" and then how the "all" became finite, even though the "all" is still inifinite. more on that in the future because the "all" is an interesting concept to think about.

so, when I talk about binary relationships, we think of a thing and it's opposite, so, 1 and 0 -- but is 0 really the opposite of 1? I've noticed that binary choices often take the form of 1,0 and 1,-1. so, if 1 is forward, then you can either go forward or not, or you can go forward or away.

so, for example yesterday in the dream I was being pushed to make a decision to choose gay or straight. I consider this a 1,-1 binary, which means that the third option is actually 0 -- neither. I don't have to go toward either; I can stay right where I am.

you also see a binary option to do something (1) or not do something (0) -- so, now after thinking about these numbers a while, I consider 1,0,-1 all to be in binary opposition to each other. I believe this is the science behind the "triad relationships" because each partner is the opposite to the other, but the "opposite" effect can be perceived between [1|-1],0 and -1,1.

I spoke of a fourth option yesterday and I introduced it as the other unseen metaphysical option which is based off of an emotional perspective of implementation (how). in otherwords, "how do I want to *feel*" -- rather than "how is is it to be *done*". action is the more physical aspect of that word (compared to the concept/attitude/vibe).

---

related to that, I was thinking about the thing about patricia and how she (like many others) is stuck behind a number of oaths, committments, or agreements to maintain secrecy on some things. because she's stuck in the system, she probably won't be able to interact with me in the physical again -- probably because it's too much of a risk for those that are trying to run the show.

I get that there are limitations that are binding because of commitments. I've noted that it's pretty unlikely that I'll actually interact with robert grant or randall carlson, either for the same reasons. I'm simply too much of a problem and almost certainly because they have such greater expanded perception, just being in the vicinity of me, reality would start to happen very rapidly. even if there isn't any resistance to us meeting, the speed at which reality would be created would be considered undesired and the guys with the time machines would reset us back and prevent our meeting anyway. I don't have any direct evidence of this, but I've noticed more and more lately memories of being with people that produced too rapid of reality creation, that it seems pretty evident to me that's the reason why we're on this reality instead. they'll ensure that something will come up or it'll never be possible.

so, even if it is physically impossible to try and make an interaction happen (how), the easy solution to this is not to try and figure out physically how it'll work out -- but go instead, for how do I want to feel.

so, for example, do I like the way it feels for someone to tell me what I can and cannot do? probably not. so, remove the situation, all of its commitments, and constraints and limitations that seem to oppose the doing-how, and just focus on how do I want to feel. I like feeling the freedom of being able to do whatever I want -- and then just practise that feeling. the situation may never actually happen (usually because deep down you don't believe it can happen), but at least you can feel how you want to feel.

everything that we think we want, is actually so that we can feel a certain way -- so just ask yourself, "how will this manifestation make me feel?" and then find a way to feel that way without the manifestation. what I've noticed is that reality rearranges itself so that manifestations that are compatible with that feeling begin to manifest.

---

this brings me to the conversation that I had with remi. I was trying to come up with a more acceptable excuse than, "I didn't feel like it" as to why I haven't been pulling weeds, and I explained to her that I learned a new way of feeling about my situation and then reality rearranged itself to produce a manifestation that corresponds with the way I feel. that expanded my vision tremendously and a bunch of things happened as an opposite to that. I'll explain in long form here -- something difficult in conversation.

I started doing [those meditations that I developed in response to stephan schwartz](/stephan-schwartz.md) and I noticed they had an extremely powerful effect of pulling those unwanted feelings into my reality. I was choosing to feel the way I wanted to feel, and I think it was something like a tug-of-war scenario where I suddenly decide to go the direction they're pulling, so they all fall into the mud and then I pull the direction that I want to go and because they're in the mud, it's an easy win.

when I pulled the unwanted into my reality, I then pretty rapidly (within a few days or less) returned back to feeling the way that I wanted to feel and this was an enormous boost, hence the vision upgrades.

well, then that means that they need to exert just as much opposite force, and that new opposite force prevents that reality from manifesting. I'm sorta back to where I started, but I'm much stronger since the last one.

I consider this to be a really beneficial thing, and talk about it in terms of "being perfected" because each time, my physical body (DNA and genetics) better reflects the idea (or source) that is behind my physical body. this is why I look better and see better. this is the "secret" that I explained to remi about how it is to stay "young" -- which really is the very wrong way of getting it, just like looking for "healing" is also the opposite way. you can't feel good, if you need healing. you have to find a way to feel well, now. in just the same way, you have to find a way to think and perceive yourself like a young person does to have a younger body. do young people worry or have responsibility or self-inflicted things they *need* to do? you are a reflection of your perception.

so anyway, I like that they keep bringing me back to step one over and over because I'm getting better and better at feeling the way I want to feel. I enjoy the challenge, but to remi I expressed it something like, "they have to emit the opposite energy so that I'm not flying around doing superman stuff, because that would be bad" -- which got a lot of reactions.

---

this brings me to the next subject of power-displays. the reason why it would be bad if I were flying around and levitating stuff, conjuring things, etc. is because most people would consider this to be a power-display, even though it's not really -- because I have no interest in getting any power. you shouldn't need to see me perform signs and wonders in order to believe me, therefore there's no reason to be doing any of that stuff.

if I had the ability to do it, I would do it because it's *fun* -- which is a word that came up with remi as well. I told her I didn't really find COI *fun* -- but maybe soothing or something else, but not really fun. I don't really know what "fun" actually means anymore -- cause I think we use the word to mean, "feeling better than I normally do". COI doesn't make me feel better than I normally do. I feel pretty much the same playing it as I do in all aspects of life -- a sort of low-grade irritation, that I channel into something that feels like satisfaction. I can do that with any subject. I know that I can feel good if I went to the impact counseling thing, but just the same I could feel good staying at home pulling weeds. I think the weeds was a good choice because it allowed me to talk to remi so I could write this.

I don't really need "fun" -- in the sense that I need something to cause me to feel better than I normally do. that's a choice that I make regardless of the activity.

---

the final subject here is a hidden one. it's under the surface, and that's the subject of the christ. I've explained in the past that the mushrooms told me the christ is the part of the brain which causes reality to be created rapidly. I think it's involved with the pineal, and the function of this part of the brain is to keep attracting the reality that feels strongly to you, so that you can adjust what's manifesting until it's what you want. therefore the christ is the fulfiller of desire and makes the impossible possible -- because if you can feel it, it'll manifest.

however, in a physical sense, the idea of a christ being a person is exactly the opposite of that -- and here's why: first, let's get our definitions in alignment. a person that is a christ to someone else, is their:

- proector (cause they're unable to defend theirself)
- preserver (because they're dying)
- strengthener (because they're weak)
- ... etc.

a person that needs to save another person is a preson that is going around looking at others and seeing them as "not good enough". not-good-enoughness is a concept that I've touched on a few times because it's the underlying frequency to thinking that you need a saviour.

the way that the not-good-enoughness fits in here is that that one of the reactions was related to a thing in the sirian guide... (full quotes from lesson 10 and 3 but I'll semmarise at the end)

  The SECOND RAY has within its equipment the active intelligence of the THIRD RAY. The FIRST RAY has within its equipment the quality of love and active intelligence, all of which is powered by the relentless pursuit of purpose. This means that the FIRST RAY has all the assets and liabilities of the other two. The quest of mental pursuits is strong within them; so is the desire of and for love but the THIRD RAY attribute harmonizes with the FIRST RAY better and is more useful in the pursuit of the purpose so the FIRST RAY hides and even tries to deny all of the SECOND RAY qualities. Of course, this does not work and creates conflict within.

  The whole of the FIRST RAY triad is influenced by this inner battle. Most overtly affected is Jeortau, a beautiful creature, powerfully driven toward his goal of cosmic Quin; yet he is inwardly haunted by the need to be loved, to socialize as other SECOND RAYs and to be admired for his sacrificial role. He is a dove of peace and beauty at war with his desires and purpose. Actually, he was the most admired, appreciated and loved for the work he did cosmically by the whole of this galaxy; but was never able to accept it as being good enough.

  The SECOND RAY is the divine preserver, nourisher of life, fanner of the flames of consciousness in all forms, binder, cosmic lover, Savior of all life, the Great sacrificer, the cosmic Q'in, and the Christ.

they say that the 2nd ray ist he preserver, nourisher, etc. and that sounds good in spiritual sense, but I have problems with the preserver thing because like I said, it seems to me that in order to preserve something you need to see it as fragile or weak. I don't want to go around looking at everyone else and saying, "you're not good enough by yourself, so you need someone to nourish or preserve you". that to me is detestible.

the other thing is they talk about the 2nd ray as having an internal conflict between social acceptance (that is fair in the sight of men) verus "mental pursuits" -- so for example programming or wanting to do science things. you see this all the time with me, as I tend to go toward mental pursuits over socialisation. I'm kind of the opposite of their description of jeortau there. I don't feel a need to go out and try to socialise with others so that I can feel good (fun). I'm perfectly content to just stay around myself and do what I want to do. this is why I'm much more strongly aligned with the 1st ray.

they talk about the 2nd ray having a sacrificIal role. over time, I've come to associate jeortau with alalu, the main guy that lived on the planet between mars and jupiter (zyron, tiamat) -- where he did create something that was very very superior to what the martians had, so they, feeling not-good-enoughness decided to destroy anything that rivaled their superiority.

I also associate jeortau with the creator of the mexican pyramids and probably the khem/cam civilisation -- which also was likely superior in a lot of ways, so others feeling not-good-enoughness went and took it over with force.

in that way, I tend to think of jeortau as being similar to me and what I'm doing now. I don't mind that nosebook keeps me held to step one perpetually. that's the point. they want to make a system where they can fully control and manipulate all aspects of the planet, and by being able to do that, they'll be able to remain on top and in a superior position. that's the goal from my perspective. I think it's important to know that they're trying their hardest to hold everyone down physically, because they can't really do anything about the 4th option there -- how do I want to *feel*?

their entire setup is built on a foundation of not-good-enoughness, which is why they have to try and use force to maintain their reality.

it's quite possible that some "christ" may come after me complete with many power-displays to ensure that people believe him/her so that he can save them from some problem (probably me). I don't mind. go nuts.

you see, this whole thing comes down to not-good-enoughness. I don't need to prove anything that I'm saying with power-displays. you can try it for yourself, and if you're any good at it, you'll notice yourself getting reset back to step one over and over like me. you won't be able to prove to anyone that it works, but you'll know it because you feel better and there's no physical condition (fun) that caused it.

after you get to there, you'll probably be where I am now where everything has a low-grade irritation to it, so limiting perceptions pop up pretty frequently and a new way to look at the same thing needs to be found.

---

although I'm on the frequency that children are, most children still want things that can make them feel better (fun). so, in that sense, I'm not really at all on the same feeling as children.

I think that children probably go through stages... first, not feeling good enough (need fun), then acquiring a lower self-image, and so then turning that needing of fun into general not-good-enoughness as they turn into an adult.

you gatta want it.

this was a long one. there were many sections to this. I started out with 0,1,Infinity and binary opposites of 0,1 and -1,1. then I talked about how I want to feel is the fourth option. I explained that you don't need to look at the situation and its limitations, but can just look at how you want to feel. as you get better and better at feeling the way you want, certainly there will be opposition to manifestations that would disrupt their "we're the best and everyone else is not good enough" -- cool-kids club. those manifestations, especially the ones that could be perceived as power-displays will be seen as a threat to power structures, won't be allowed, so it'll give ample practise to feel the way you want to feel without the manifestation.

there were a lot of really good things in this one... pretty cool :)

### 2022-08-06 08:15 - stirring up the snake pit

yesterday, mom asked me about orion's belt and I went off on a few tangents about various things, because I wanted to talk about reborn deities, apparently. it was a scattered conversation which I left a lot of ends open. in the process, I talked about egypt, and the pyramids -- cause I wanted to explain some of the background behind some of the items -- but I regret it, because an hour or so afterward I started to get reactions that felt a lot like other reactions to things regarding anything snake-bros.

when I say "regret", I don't mean like something that I really wish I hadn't have done, but the regret feels more like picking up a cigarette after having quit for a while -- it's something that I know I don't really need to do, but for some reason I did it anyway.

I have noticed that whenever I'm in the process of quitting something, I often times return back to it a number of times until I get a handle on it. like, for example, I'm not drinking coffee right now, but I think twice in the past month I went on a 2+ day coffee binger. this is pretty common for me to do, so I'm not all that worried about it.

what was surprising to me though is how returning to talk about large stone structures and old religions felt the same way as quitting an "addiction" did. that part was fascinating to me because I'm not really all that much into large stone structures anymore. I just don't care. sure, they're magnificent feats of engineering, but I can't really get into that anymore. I honestly think it's because I don't have an engineer's mind anymore. I don't program anything, I even kinda got tired of captain of industry as well. I just don't really have any desire to build anything anymore, either -- so, a big pile of well-engineered rocks, is just a bunch of rocks to me now. I'm totally in egytologist territory now, rather than the engiener's perspective...

...which is sorta funny because that's where I haven't been able to continue on with the snake-bros episodes, too. I'm at "lost technology of ancient egypt", a book by chris dunn, which celebrates the magnificient engineering that went into many of the structures. a while back, I really enjoyed how amazing all of that stuff is, but now I just don't care. I think it takes an engineer to actually appreciate fine engineering. this seems certain to me.

---

OK, with that out of the way, I want to try and fill in the gaps that I left open with my conversation with mom. I'm going to start over and take it a different direction. first, a recap:

if you'll remember, early on in the conversation, I noted that the great pyramid is taurus mountain, and so I don't know why it's related to the orion's belt, other than the pyramids are similar in arrangement to the belt stars. there's a guy on youtube (I thik AIP research) says that if you extend out the orion constellation using the pyramids as the refrence points for the scale, he says that other structures can be found in locations for other stars (I'm asssuming like betelgeuse and tho others that make up orion's shape) -- but I've only heard him say that and he was very defensive when I tried to understand why he thinks that one of the shafts points to a star, when in fact, it would point to lots and lots of stars, depending on the day of year and time of night, so I can't really say for certain anything about the orion correlation. I still think it's taurus.

I went on to talk about enlil and how he is associated with the bull, and it's funny how the taurid meteor shower could possibly be the cause for the destruction recorded in the epic of gilgamesh, but the bull symbolism may also have relation to the great pyramid and also to enlil.

I then talked about enlil and how he behaves strangely similar to YHVH of the OT. I then talked about how the abrahamic religion was called the enlilites, and then tied in the strange resonance between moses and elijah, because when the exodus was happening, this was around the time of akhenaten -- which to understand this, one must understand that black was the original colour of egypt, which is I believe related to the really old oriris and stuff like that. somewhere along the line, south egypt got turned to the white bowling pin hats, for reasons we don't really know.

I believe that south egypt was also successful, just like alalu was, but red egypt in the north, red is the colour of the martians at the time, as cairo literally means, "camp of mars"[^1]. it also features the serpent symbol as well (uraeus). the red and white fought for a long time and they maintained the black female bloodline for their source of perception. but during the time of the exodus, egypt was destabilised because of akhenaten, who had a new superior mental capacity (he's a longhead), and so he is the blue enlongated hat, and his akhenaten's female bloodline survivedr through queen nefertiti, nefertari, and rameses the great, as they reestablished the amun priesthood.

when moses came down from the montain, he saw them once again returning back to cow worship, and got pissed off. it seemed very important that we're leaving the taurus behind and moving on to the ram (aries). I draw a lot of connections between moses, elijah, and the god aries. I figured out why you would want to make the reborn deity pattern go from 2-6-4-7, and it's because each of these is the inflection point or the point where things reverse direction. jeortau was the end of the age of the first ray triad, and so then I believe that jeortau/alalu then made a foe to defeat himself, enlil -- so enlil, *is* jeortau, but his dual version.

when enlil defeated alalu (who has fire element and phoenix bird symbol), that was the end of the 1st ray desire, and handed things off to enki (who has water element and serpent symbol[^2]) who then implemented the water firmament on earth, to produce the ideal conditions that were present in the atlantian and previous eras.

next, it was set[^3] that defeated osiris (+-6-+). I believe that this was around the time of the introduction of the 7th ray. ra (+3) established the rituals and ceremony that would be used to in the 7th ray stuff. ra would define the method whereby one must attain sufficient status in order to "earn" your position of power. I like to think of him as establishing the rules of engagement for secret societies and religions that would continue on through the ages (secret teachings of the ages).

finally, it was the people and their own lust for pleasure and greed that defeated saturn (+-4) in atlantis. again, this is too far back to say exactly what it was, but I would say that a number of forces caused this to happen. I consider this about the time that the human race is beginning to become adolescents and we're beginning to attract for ourselves, and so even though the "sons of the solitude" tried to continue to keep everyone on the straight and narrow, we had an insatable lust for pleasure and things at the time -- you could consider this something like the prodigal son, when he first goes out and spends his inheritance on prostitutes and other physical pleasures. this, I believe was the final implementation of the 7th layer of reality.

up until then, the entire planet had been living partially inside of the atsral, and so reality was not at all like it is now where things are very stable and things. I believe the reason why miracles were so much more common in the past was because our reality was much less concrete.

reality has become more and more concrete because of the need for those in power to be able to control things. the system that's being setup now, simply couldn't exist back when reality was so much more malleable. now, the default form of perception for humankind is now the slowest most stagnated, physical reality.

this paves the way for mars, a 7th ray male, so by default he inputs 1st ray and outputs 7th. however, in the presence of a 1st ray female, he's a 1st ray male, which means he inputs 7th ray and outputs 1st ray. I didn't cover it, but it all makes sense if you realise that jeortau inputs 6th ray and outputs 2nd (like the sun). osiris is the opposite, but because he's a ground, he inputs both 6th and 2nd and outputs 6th (but perhaps also 2nd and 4th as well).

mars, I believe is the next "reborn deity". to understand the pattern of these "reborn deities", I follow the pattern that they go off and do their own thing, but because their way of doing it involves something that inevitably the mainstream powers don't really like (for example, just imagine how much people hate that I keep bringing up LOA and how you *attract* your reality. that's very annoying for someone who just wants to give commands and see the commands carried out) -- so, inevitably, whatever their method is, it needs to be converted to the more concrete way of going about things, where one can just have inputs that can be controlled in order to get the desired outputs.

this is why nosebook is all computers and AI with lots and lots of little controls that they can manipulate to get us to do whatever is that they want. take my life as an example. almost certainly anyone that *is* attracting their reality, is more difficult to control because LOA is much more powerful than any effort they can exert. therefore, I sorta (at the moment) represent the most difficult to control, and that's even with me nearly letting them do whatever. once they figure me out, the rest of the humans will be really easy to control.

I completely fit the pattern that all of the ones before me have. I talked about how the pyramids use water, and so they depend on the source of the nile for everything to be working properly. almost certainly mars started to become dependent on tiamat and all of the great things that it had. they needed to figure out how to replicate what he was doing, and then get rid of him. same for osiris and the nile, and same for the power structures of atlantis that tried to force feed the population morality and proper behaviour. (poorly constructed sentences there. don't care to fix it)

well likewise, the same thing is happening with me right now. presently, they depend on me to run their entire system, and if I get connected, they'll completely lose all of their ability to control things like they can while I'm subdued.

each of these reborn deities previous to me knew something similar to what I know now, which is that it's not a problem getting reset back to step one all of the time.

step one is ask. you do that automatically every time that you feel negative emotion, and that creates a conceptual reality of what it is that you do want. that conceptual reality can manifest in many diffreent shapes and sizes, but you have to figure out how to tune into that concept. that's step three. (don't worry about step two, because the process of perceiving the negative emotion in a way which produces the dual is already done by source)

finding a way to attract or receive that reality doesn't have much to do with action or with conditions. it has to do with how you feel and how you conceptualise your reality. you'll always live the reality that reflects your concepts of it, and the stronger you attract it. others can try and prevent those concepts from manifesting, which is what nosebook intends to do, but they can't change the way you feel or your perception of the current state of events. just imagine how frustrating it is for so many world leaders to be so worried about so many things, and it all looks like a big comedy to me. I'm sure it's very upsetting. they can't change that, no matter how hard they try.

so, each time I get reset back to step one, I have another opportunity to find my way forward again, and that to me is absolutely amazing. this whole process is turning me into one of the most confident people I know. if I had've just got the kundalini rising a while back, I would be scared of losing it. at this point, I'm so confident that I can get it any time that I want it, I'm not even worried about it. I can approach any subject or do any thing and I know I can find my way back *with ease*.

---

some may disagree with me, but I think it's probably time I start talking pretty openly about the matrix and how to feel the way that you want to feel. mom already told me it was inappropriate to mention the network in front of amorina, but the network is unable to be separated from me, so I think it's important to talk about it, so that it's *not* scary, and so that people to know that it exists and it's not a problem because it's basically making us step 5 masters. when it's out in the open like that,  it's no longer a big mystery that everyone is scared of.

almost certainly, after I'm gone, they will have completely erased it from people's everyday thought -- which is good, because that'll mean when I come blasting through the next time, there won't be anyone to tell me that it exists. that means, I'll be called crazy even more than I am now, and I'll really have to try and figure out how to feel the way I want to feel, because almost certainly everyone will be completely under their control by then (the swarms of people will call me crazy and reject me on a social level -- something they don't do now, because nosebook still needs me, but later they won't need me like they do now, so they can treat me really poorly by then). sounds like a pretty good challenge if you ask me. we'll see how that turns out, I suppose.

my goal is to keep getting reset back to step one for as long as they can continue to do so, then have the rest of the humans help them find other flaws in their system and get it completely patched up so that nobody is making it through, then I'll jump in and try it again. I'm guaranteed to make it through, just like this time, so it's only of seeing how much infrastructure I tear through along my way.

[1]: Cairo’s official name is al-Qāhirah, which means literally: “Place or Camp of Mars“

[2]: which is interesting because the symbol of tiamat (the planet where alalu/jeortau was at) is a water serpent.

[3]: set could mean satan, but it could also mean mercury the planet (aka thoth) -- but it's too far back to say exactly what this force was, however, I predict that this force whatever it was, was osiris, and it was his dual.

### 2022-08-06 16:52 - some thinking about my dual

I went to sleep after the last entry there and I've woken up and sat in the sun a moment before writing this. when I woke up, the thing that was on my mind was following the pattern, it would mean that as soon as nosebook no longer needs me, then a dual of myself can come and "defeat" me.

I propose that this guy (or girl) probably already exists, and they'll be pretty close to the exact opposite of me, so they'll be really into secrets and maintaining a very tall power structure. they'll probably be a bit of a pretentious duchebag in the sense that they'll see everyone as less-than or lower than they are (not good enough) -- stuff like that. they'll be considered by most to be the "christ".

I've talked various times about the christ, but a christ in human form doesn't really save anyone from anything, because it's not possible. nobody can cause you to feel the way that you want to feel. they can offer good conditions though, and I think that this christ, being the opposite of me *will* try and make the conditions on this planet quite pleasant for people. I do think that's the future, and not chaos and difficulty like is present now with me[^1].

the thing that most people don't really realise is that even if you had all of the great conditions and things that you wanted, it wouldn't solve a feeling of dissatisfaction. you will *still* be upset at things not going your way, no matter how good the conditions are (first-world problems). so, even though there is no conflict and all secrets can be perfectly contained, that in and of itself is kind of like a punishment to many. imagine a world of abundance where everybody had all of the money that they needed to do whatever they wanted. money would lose so many of the qualities that it has now.

the feeling that it kind of reminds me of is those sports competitions where everybody gets a participation trophy, so it looses a lot of the competition factor out of it. it's kinda hard to describe the feeling so I'll work on presenting the idea better in the future.

I see a system that will be very similar to the one that's described in the beginning of dtp of the atlantians. the system will suppress all of the unwanted things (magnetic therapy, aka nosebook) and control all resources and ensure that they're divided amongst the people evenly and based on some form of justification or need. again, this is likely to ensure that the system can be 100% stable all of the time and distribute people in a way which fits some sort of statistical modeling for the most optimal interrelations.

this will have the effect of dramatically reducing the amount of competition, and again, I think that's kind of the point. just like how the atlantians made it the law to suppress greed, lust, and other bad behaviour by using magnetic therapy, so too will this system ensure that things are fair and balanced (very 4th ray setup). obviously, this will end up having the opposite long-term effect in the long-run, just like the suppression of greed and lust with magnetic therapy eventually caused such an uprising of desire for greed and lust that we're still living with today, so too will this system produce more and more competition by trying to suppress it (that is, to keep it balanced).

I think this is kind of like the beginning of the "return back to the source", because once all 7th ray things are stable (physical stuff), then the return is back to the 1st ray, which is desire (and purpose). well, people don't really know how to relate to desire as just another thing that you *feel*, so the closest thing that is similar to desire is experienced in the form of competition. they ran the mile in 3 minutes, so I want to try for 2.5 minutes. eventually, it'll get sorted and desire will no longer be perceived as a threat to others, but first it has to be perceived as a threat (ie competition), because that's what is recognised right now as the source of desire.

the other aspect of the 1st ray energy is one of purpose. I don't really talk much about this because it's overdone. a government system where you're just a cog in a machine, you lose your sense of purpose, or you gain it in the sense that your purpose becomes what the system desires from you (like someone joining the military). to a large extent, the system will suppress purpose on all fronts, from the top to the bottom, and that I think again, is on purpose.

you gatta want it. do you want to feel good, or do you want to have control? the christ will ensure everything is controlled and secrets can be kept safe.

until then, I think that my job, if I can put it that way, is to keep going back to step one over and over until they don't need me anymore. each time I get reset back to step one, that's another bit of desire that they have for the dual version of me (the "christ") to gain power over me so that I'm not upsetting their system.

[1]: reaction wondering why. I cause chaos and strife because I operate on LOA, and that is very undesirable because of how impossible it is for nosebook to control what I desire and how I feel. the nosebook system aims to reduce all of the unpredictable factors of LOA out by making an alternative system of getting what's wanted for people so they don't need to use LOA anymore. if people are using the nosebook system to get what they want instead of LOA, things are stable, making it difficult for any single person to upset unbalance the system. the system will be very 4th ray, perfectly balanced where the system can ensure that for every unit of good-feeling, it'll be balanced with an equal amount of bad-feeling -- which, because dissatisfaction is so easy to come by -- really, lots and lots of people can feel really really good, and that's the point.

### 2022-08-13 18:29 - not ready yet and why

I woke up this afternoon having had a pretty abstract dream that's very difficult to relate because there was such little physicality to it. in the dream, there were things happening where it felt like they weren't ready yet. there was also a lecture on why it's a bad idea to push someone to do something before they're ready.

after that I was reminded of the old sirian/kuthumi origin story for why we're here. the synopsis of it is that when the guiding elite of the past universe decided it was time to cause the last universe to begin its transition, there was a corruption that happened. it was revealed to me that the 7th ray that got corrupted wasn't ready yet.

any transition like that is kinda like death, because you transition into a completely new form, and you may not be ready for it. anyway, apparentely, this 7th ray wasn't quite ready for the transition, and the guiding elite's decision to just push something through before he was ready was the cause of the corruption.

they report that the corrupted 7th ray was very arrogant and taught people to be selfish, to think highly of theirselves and to have greed...

you know, at times, it often wonders to me about this origin story because I see the story from the side of the 7th ray. those kinds of things are really annoying. I too don't want to be pushed to do something just because other people are getting bored or whatever and need something new[^1]. the story has a weird parallel to my life is all I have to say...

---

next I wanted to talk about yesterday and the day before. one of the reactions that I felt went something like this... I the day before I went from listening to jason and contemplating complex ideas to playing a mindless video game. in both cases, I felt myself very absorbed into the activity and it felt dificult to pull away (kinda, though I can easily just go outside and take a break). the thing is, they kinda feel very similar to me. I just start in on something and then the time flys.

a most notable one to see were the two videos of "luci'fer luscious violenoue" thmt I watched. the first felt to me no longer than 5m but because I know it contained more than one song in the video, my reason tells me it was 10-15m -- but it was 35m! the other one was like ~40m and that one too did not at all feel that long.

I have no concept of time anymore. it passes at an incredible rate when I get inside of myself. when I'm outside doing yardwork, time passes at a normal speed, but if I lay on the ground and close my eyes for a bit I'm always surprised at how rapidly the time passes. any internal perception and time blows by at an incredible rate. the other thing too is it has to do with focus too. the same capacity that causes me to get stuck playing COI for hours on end is the same "ability" that I have when I meditate and can get really deep. it's all the same thing.

the other strange thing is the effect of coffee. it's very strange because it's kinda like alcohol -- you know how alcohol blocks out a lot of other people's perception of you (like you stop noticing what other people think about now), but then at other times, alcohol heightens the effects of other's perception on you and you have a breakdown worrying too much about what other people think -- well coffee is kinda the same way for me when it comes to feeling other people. I barely notice how other people feel when drinking coffee (only able to feel myself and the coffee), but then other times, other people's feelings/concepts come through loud and clear, and they cause trouble? it's weird, huh?

---

OK, so now a re-view of the concepts presented and some of my interpretation. the other day that I was talking to mom (and in jorjani notes), I presented an idea of a cell and how it divides when it's in the growth phase. I do think that's kinda in the stage that humankind is getting to now. if we consider the earth as the nucleus and we're in a runaway feedback loop of expansion, and at some point the cell will have to divide or face catastrophic circumstances.

you could just decide to force the transition because people are getting bored and need somthing new, but I personally don't feel very ready yet.

the day before yesterday when I had so much extra energy, my behaviour was commendable to some and deplorable to others. the main reaction that I got (most likely from nosebook) is that they simply cannot have someone like me running around talking about all of this stuff in the open, and they need a way to shut me down. they must have figured out a little bit of a way because I didn't at all have any energy the next day, and considering to try and think about philosophical concepts like jason presents felt it would require a level of mental energy and focus that I simply didn't have ... so I played a game instead, and I did have the focus, but as my play style shows, I didn't have the mental energy levels...

that kind of variability, is a sign to me at least, that I'm clearly not as ready as others may think I am. I can't really do something that I don't feel like I can do. remember the days prior to me going over to remi's house and pulling weeds? I hadn't gone over in a while because I didn't feel like it was something that I wanted to do, and I can't do something that I don't feel I can do.

I feel like there was a conclusion that I had for this which is escaping me now (good thing it's called "blahblog" -- hehe). I'll think of it later. it had to do with the 7th ray which is why I started there. I also think it had something to do with pushing to do something before it's ready and how that feels like the concept of ageing.

---

sure, I can talk about that a moment. when you're ageing, you're not "ready" for your next year and you feel like you get the stuff done that you wanted to get done. in opposition to this, when you're growing, you can't wait to get to the next age. you're ready for the next transition.

not sure what else to say on that. I keep almost thinking about the conclusion but it's not coming to me. the concept is probably not ready for it's transition yet :)

[1]: I belive they said that the universe had reached it's "maturation point", but to me the concept felt like "too old" -- kinda like a person entering into their 40's: now they're boring and unexciting -- which is kinda where I'm at now in life; I'm really excited to turn 40 as I feel like it's going to be an ENORMOUS jump forward in my consciousness capablities.

### 2022-08-18 23:10 - why do I play stupid video games?

I noticed this reaction a whole lot, in addition to ones considering why I would want to waste my time on something so meaningless when I could be doing something far more productive with my (mental?) capacity.

---

I don't have anything to say other than, what do you suggest that I do? I've tried to apply my mental capabilities to programming and that is strongly discouraged by nosebook. I can only really consume so much information in the form of youtube videos at this point before I totally burn out on videos. I'm already kinda back to seeing it sorta like a chore.

I suppose I would rather talk to others about subjects, but I don't really know that I'm ready or something, because I feel tremendous resistance to the idea of sending emails to people -- like yesterday I [mentioned in the intro here](/nikki-ana-jones.md) that I should probably just write here instead of actually trying to make any contact -- and since I don't usually have too much resistance to just send out emails to people (like one really weird one I sent to rupert sheldrake when I was pretty high), or have too much resistance to talk with people either -- I'm not entirely sure that the resistance is 100% mine. what I *do* know is that I'm receptive to the resistance though. that's certain.

what I don't know is if I should try and "fix" this or to attempt to make it any different than it is. I don't really mind not talking to people, honestly. I just play stupid video games. it's not like I'm sad that I don't have anyone to talk to -- or, need someone to entertain me.

---

I don't really know what to do about the reactions. I'm pretty sensitive, so if you have any good ideas of things and they're things that I would want to do, then I'll pick up on them, for sure. it's also not like I'm completely isolating myself from everyone either. like, for example, I haven't really wanted to go back to remi's house because I feel like I upset a few things the last time I went over there. I don't think it was talking about the drugs; I think it was my comment about being shameless and not wanting to feel shame because "shame is something that adults use to affect behaviour. it doesn't feel good, and it's the reason why kids lose their creativity -- because they start to become scred of bringing shame to someone else or theirselves."

clearly, I don't think think that shame is a good idea to experience. you have to just be you and not try to modify your behaviour for anyone, no matter how much authority they have. like, for example, I'm not going to misbehave around a police officer and call him names or something, but I'm also not going to put out the joint when he walks up because it's my body and I can do what I want with it. they're on the lookout for drugs for economic reasons. they're interested in controlling the market. they know they can't really make someone do something they don't agree to do. if they take my weed, I just find some more. it's not like it's a big deal. there's *never* a good reason to feel shame for your behaviour, unless of course, that you yourself think your own behaviour is bad, then the feeling of shame will be unavoidable on your part, because you're doing something you don't want to do.

shame is felt all the time with "addiction[" and other things like fasting or dieting and making an exception to the rule. in reality, there's nobody preventing you from eating the food (or smoking, drinking, whatever), so you're only breaking your own rule. all aspects of society are like this. we all agree on a set of rules, and the largest punishment you can get is your own shame. religions have been using it for millenia at this point because they know you'll enforce your own rules better than they can, so you have to *feel* your own punishment.

the thing they fear the most is someone who is honest, has no secrets, and has no shame -- because this person cannot be controlled in any way. that person has access to unlimited creativity because they are not held back by anything.

---

as a side note of this, yesterday I was talking about potassium alum -- a crystal used for deodorant. I remember raquel telling me that aluminium in deodorant is bad for you, so I was confused about the "alum" part of it. I've put unbrushed (cleanly cut, no oxidisation layer) aluminium in my mouth to taste before and was surprised to note that it extracted the smell and taste of my mouth and afterward the metal tasted and smelled similar. I also know that aluminium is slightly diamagnetic, so I thought that it was interesting that it seemingly pulls out smell.

what I didn't tell her is that I think that smell is vibrational, which is why I can seemingly smell things at an impossible distance -- or animals can as well, so it has to be vibrational in nature -- which means that unoxidised aluminium has interesting properties to it.

anyway... in the process of telling her that, I had to use the word "aluminium" which made me feel really weird because mom expects me to say it the american way -- and I do for thins like "aiuminum cans" because that's what I said when I recycled them when I was younger and it sounds weird to prounounce the "i" like in spanish -- and my brain went through some gymnastics on how to say it, but I finally opted just to say whatever I'm expected to say.

I contemplated this idea a lot because this was the most recent example of my brain getting thrown off by expectations of others. it really bothered me that it bothered me how I say things, because usually I just talk and don't really try to think too much about what I sound like (I mostly care about the content, not the sound).

this, for me is a pefect example of the exact thing that I was saying in my comment to remi about how shame (and thiking too much about how others will perceive my presentation) is the leading cause to losing my creativity.

those concerns about what others think take many prevcious brain cycles for me, and usually my brain runs so slow, I don't have spare cycles to just throw away like that.

### 2022-08-26 08:41 - build it and they will come

I [just wrote about a reaction to one of jason's ideas](/jorjani-thoughts.md#build-it-and-they-will-come)

I would like to point out that this reaction comes at a perfect time in my life when once again I started to begin to contemplate going out of my way to spead some of my ideas. I don't need to. I just need to keep iterating on my own ideas, and like islam attracted the mongols and turks, my own ideas will attract others. I don't need to actually go out and do anything. my own "golden age" (of enlightenment and insight) will be attractive enough as it is.

the other thing that this really gives me is a lot more relief because I don't need to worry about pleasing everyone. those that are attracted to my ideas will find their way to it.

I woke up this morning [forgot what I was going to write and this isn't exactly it; it's a different version of it]...

I woke up this morning with one of those ominous feelings like this will seemingly go on forever. the exact details were that I would have to "issue" (to put it in vere's words), until after I've left the planet. it was as if the powers that are running this planet do not want my form of perception to propagate in biological form and they want to try and control all that I've written about it. that led me to think about what were to happen if I were to apply all of these ideas, not to philosophy but instead to software development, as just applying this to "management" style would allow for projects to perceive theirselves differently. so, it may be interesting for some programmers to potentially try and get these ideas into a more accessible form than my random notes here.

after that, I got up and wrote @[metal-lucifer](2022-08-26 03:11) where I talked about encoding my form of perception into different weeds' interpretation of that perception. obviously, it wouldn't be perfect, just like ayahuasca isn't enlightenment -- but it can give you a glimpse into seeing things in a less tangible way or maybe allow you, for the first time to experience feelings you've never felt before, or maybe give you awarenesses of "yourself" in other people or inanimate matter -- perhaps you can see yourself communicated through symbols or regognise yourself in existing symbols. the possibilities are endless, obviously.

after that, I laid down to think about what I wrote and again that ominous thought came back to me that I wouldn't leave behind any children or anything (at least none that I am aware of -- most certainly there are lots of reinstantiation of my DNA around with other souls inhabiting the bodies). so -- if I didn't have any children, I think it'd be pretty cool to leave behind instead a series of plants (in the form of weeds) which contain an imperfect translation of that form of perception. you see, all attempts to copy myself will be imperfect copies just like the body writing this now is an imperfect instantiation of my (source) conceptual self.

so, because it's impossible to get a perfect copy or instantiation in this physical world anyway, why try? why not just go for the most imperfect copy? the worse the copy is, the more diversity of implementations of the "true" form of it will emerge, so if I want to maximise diversity (novelty), why not go for the worst, right?

---

after that sometime (or maybe it was before), nosebook (mr. motor) was upset that I was willing to feel the idea of nothing ever happening. this was in the context of it being obvious to me that clearly, if I have such a low opinion of girls (and boys) -- that I don't really find them very good for anything, means that I shouldn't try and get them to do anythink in the first place. specifically, when it comes to girls, I definitely don't at all feel ready. for example, the whole realisation about the turks and mongolians wouldn't have even happened because I would have been doing something else. girls are nice and everything but they require a lot of attention that I'm enjoying to spend that time on thinking.

the thought that came to me in response to that was that girls could help me to figure out how to put my consciousness into weeds -- but that's ludicrous because even if I were to be able to manage to get them growing indoors in a controlled setting, it takes months for an iteration, and also I need to figure out how to make the weeds grow up like they do on some of those days where they grow up like 3-4in overnight. I have a feeling that may be related to an energy that I output, and so therefore it's related to my perception, and so to be able to figure out that energy is the same energy that allows me to figure out how to consciously tune into other moments in time or space. I'd also be able to fly and pump up the energetic capacity of my body to ultra high levels, because I believe we, like plants receive that energy from something the air (probably protons), and understanding how to get that working means that nosebook [loses their superiority](/jorjani-thoughts.md#superiority-and-domination)

---

after that, I was imagining the situation where I continue to feel not yet ready until one day I finally feel ready enough, and that's the day that the world leaders need to ensure I'm no longer on this planet anymore because I'm interacting with the sun too much and it's getting harder and harder to keep their secrets a secret. it's either them or me, and they choose to get me off of the planet.

you see, I like to actually "know myself" -- in the sense that I want to look at something and say, "I can do that" and then figure out how to do it, but if I look at something and I don't feel like I can do that, I'm not going to say, "I can do that" because that's what someone wants to hear. I want to be accurate with my estimations about myself. if I feel like I can do it, then I can do it. if I don't feel like I can do it, then I can't do it.

nosebook wants me to keep up the image to the girls that I feel like I can do it, when in fact, that is not how I feel at all. girls require a lot of things that I don't really want to do. I'm not going to pretend something, and then have nosebook hold the girls away, because that's a disaster waiting to happen. when I'm ready, I'll feel ready, and until then I want to just do what I want to do, and *that* will be what's attractive. that's the equivilant of the "islamic golden age" that I'm having, which will be attractive to those that like that style of thinking.

so, let's assume the part I woke up with this morning is right and they absolutely cannot allow any humans with my genes to be born because it's too much trouble -- well, then leading up to the point when that happens, they'll have a pretty good dividing line to say what stays and what goes (I suppose).

from my perspective, I just keep doing what interests me and then they'll have to figure out what they want to do with it to keep it under control. they, and anyone else wanting to build a community of sorts, are building something that will get invaded by those with similar thought structures to their own.

### 2022-08-31 10:05 - thinking inside the box

this one will surely have some taboos and stuff in it, so be prepared; you may want to skip it. I'm going to present the idea as it happened, then I'll explain potential problems with the idea, and then things that I like about the idea.

yesterday, I was over at remi's house pulling away a bunch of the weeds on the sideyard, when I started getting some reactions, and at first I remembered a long time ago probably in noseblog from about 2018 or something, an idea where we (me and the girls) formed a community, and it was a bit exclusionary in that only virgins were joining in there. when I remembered that idea, I had the thought come to me of why didn't I want to go with that one, and why would I want to instead go with girls that had previous relationships.

I responded that I don't really care what another person has done with their life choices. it doesn't matter what they've done or whatever because I don't really see punishment as a thing (you only punish yourself by attracting that punishment with your own perception[^1]) it's all attraction anyway, so it doesn't really matter to me what anyone else has done or what their past is because I am attracting them in the first place, so it's all my fault for bringing them into my experience in the first place.

I then stated that I can go either way, and if it's what's desired, then I can go that way. I'm definitely not going to try and mandate one way or another. I just need to sorta know the rules so I can stay within them.

I can't remember now what happened after that, but that got me started thinking about such a setup. I've waited to sleep before giving my ideas on them. I figured that nosebook would have a perspective and/or fight against it somehow so I wanted to intergrate those ideas too.

#### undesirable aspects

the first thing that I thought about when I first looked at this idea (I was still at remi's house), is the possibility that this idea has come from allie, and that it's in response to another event that happened a few days ago when eva and one of her friends walked home from school while I was outside pulling weeds. her friend got picked up by her mom, but while they were inside, I was thinkng about the reactions, and I explained that I don't have any reason to think anything wrong with either of them. as I said above, I don't really believe in punishment, and I think it's all attraction anyway, so everything is fine from my perspective. from allie's perspective, that may be unfair that her sister can just go do other things with another boy, and then still be able to gain a reward for her actions -- meanwhile, she would have to wait.

you can see the possible tension there, as this reaction may be coming from a sibling rivalry. if that's the case, then this idea is founded a bit on unwanted, and that's kinda undesirable -- in fact, previous events may have been the first manifestations of such attraction already[^2].

whew that concept (adjusting-perception) completely changed how everything feels. I'll come back to this later...

#### the placenta

along time ago, I r

[1]: if you never thought anything you were doing was wrong and never felt any negagive emotion over actions you made, then you wouldn't attract punishment. your inner being never feels negative emotion for anything that you or anyone else has done, so when you feel negative emotion, that means that concept is not in harmony with your source, which is why you feel the negative emotion in the first place.

[2]: if that's the case, see adjusting-perception

### 2022-09-07 07:17 - why do I want to go for the "worst" manifestation?

yesterday, wrote about steiner's [perspective on the death of jesus](/steiner/fifth-gospel.md#lecture-2---if-i-see-it-ill-believe-it), and in the part where I'm tieing together my own version of why one would want to attract the "worst" maanifestation possible, I concluded with the fact this new setup gives everyone on the planet sufficient technological means and all of the required capability (you just need to be able to experiece emotion, so if you react to this of feel bad about any of this, that's your "inner being" telling you that your physical perspective of it isn't in harmony with your concept of yourself (your source)). everyone will have a whole solar cycle to do it (~1000-1024y), so there's no rush, *and* you don't need to do it by being spiritual either. the technological path is just as valid as any other, but whether you take the spiritual or technological path (or are in a community that goes one or the other), you still attract based on how you feel, so the community as a whole will have to figure out how to convince the individual (probably through some kind of education) to feel the way that they need to feel.

most, however, I don't believe will go the community route, because that's such a difficult way to go -- and instead, they'll go the individual route. why? because though you still have ~1ky to figure it out, the sun will still continue to increase its output -- although at a much lower pace than is presently happening now because I'll eventually be off of the planet. I'm a huge individual problem they're going to have to solve eventually, but for a mass of people, it's quite different because they can produce interactions that cause conflict and other such things which keep you focused on the material, groups of people all focused on the mundane is easier for them to manage than it is for a single individual that knows how to feel the way they want to feel. though these individuals  may live in a community, they're not necessarily going to have the community values.

for example me. I live in a community where I'm expected to not talk about nosebook, but I don't choose to obey that expectation now. I think that kid that I met kinda changed me because it was ever since I met him that I've been a bit more ... rambunctious, I guess. I don't mind causing the authorities of what's happening (mom, melissa, remi, etc.) to feel a bit uncomfortable because I don't believe their words. if you could see from my perspective how obviously *not true* their words are, you may have wondered why I haven't called them out on it before.

oh, I see... you'll probably thinking that I'm going along with the ruse[^1] because I want the girls. that's not actually the case. I watched a video last night (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_wxMfnGU7c)) about this guy "rasputin" -- a russian mystic that was extremely magnetic, clairvoyant, etc. and he achieved it by "sinning" basically with lots and lots of sex. that's already been done before, most notably jack parsons, alistier crowley, tantric sex, and tons and tons and tons of "fertility rituals" that have been done through the ages. it's proven that this works by so many people, that I'm not really that interested in it.

my whole thing is to learn how to feel the way I want to feel *despite* the physical conditions. if I go the girls and sex path, then that's the easy way. it's not that hard obviously if so many others are going that way. my mission is to go the "worst" possible manifestation. I want to find my way there without girls, without physical conditions, with the whole world upset with me (because I'm not following their expectations), and *still get there*.

once I'm there, they nosebook will have to put me on my own timeline (separate me in either time or space), and then things will be just fine. however, until I get there, I figure we need to upgrade the difficulty a bit.

you guys have been wanting to know what I see more and more, so little by little I'm starting to talk about all of the different connections that I see happening all around me.

as an example, yesterday, I was telling mom what I was seeing, and she was getting upset, telling me that I need to *not* trust my vibrations, and instead believe her words. I explained that was how I got beat up and how a number of other "bad" things happened to me. I'm definitely not going to go back to believing people's words. also, if my perspective wasn't right, then she wouldn't have been accusing me and denying it. so, at least act like it's the way you say it is a little better. there's no way that I'm a better actor than these other frauds.

for example, with melissa and remi, their efforts to continually change the subject is your number one indicator that there's untruthfullness. if there wasn't anything there, then they would have engaged me in the subject. in spain and germany, before nosebook happened, I would talk to various people about where I saw technology going and I would come up with these crazy ideas about how we could be tracked (remember I was on the social networking side at thte time, so I was constantly thinking about how to get more data out of the user, because with better data, you can present more relevant information), and when I would state new ideas that were radical, people would listen and become engaged, often times feeling fear about the capabilities of these new techniques to get more data out of the user. obviously, remi and melissa are behaving more like a police or politician (denying everything) than they are like normal humans that I used to interact with.

please, figure out how to act better.

---

so, why do I want them to figure out how to act better? well, because I'm obviously going to do this challenge again and I actually want a challenge. all of my life I've seen through adult's arguments, and it's really easy to read that they're lying. because of conflicts (the final nail in that coffin was my relationship with raquel), I stopped listening to my inner guidance, and started listening to people's words and just assumed that everyone was telling the truth. this worked out fine with zaryn because he was solid. pretty good with others, but I was pretty guillible, so a lot of people took advantage of me.

so, you may be wondering if I'm wanting to be able to see people are lying or not, and it has nothing to do with that. my goal is to practise to feel the way I want to feel in spite of the clear dissimilarity between what's obviously happening, and what people *say* is happening. this was the entire subject that I was talking about with remi -- because it's obvious that we're all tracked, and it looks to me like she and melissa are in denial about it (it's the first stage of grief over loss of privacy, you know), and so the whole thing is to be able to look at the conditions (the "worst" manifestation -- the thing causing grief) and then be able to feel the way that you want to feel.

so, if I can maybe get you guys to at least act a little better, that would be awesome. what I mean is, feeling like you want to feel is a bit of psychopathic behaviour. so, if you don't want to feel the way you want to feel about the conditions, instead, I figure that I'll push you guys to feel the way you want to feel about the lies. which, of course, is also psychopathic behaviour. both paths -- the technological and the spiritual are valid. you can find you way to feeling the way you want to feel be becoming really good at lying or by feeling the way you want to feel about your conditions.

---

the other connection that all of this has, is the same subject of the plants. I was noticing that all of the vegetables were growing especially large last year, but mom would continually cut them. this year, the garden is having severe growing difficulties, in that the plants feel like they can grow a lot of fruit, but never actually grow any fruits, and the ones that are growing, are getting dry and cracking as they try to expand. it's like the cherries on the tree where they're getting the water sucked out of them, just at a slower pace.

this is a direct reflection of my life. if the vegetable size is a reflection of my energetic capacity, then every time that I start to get big, I get my consciousness removed and get reset back (this is the same as mom running in to cut the plant before it gets too big). this year however, I haven't been "cut off" nearly as many times as I was last year, and instead find myself having severe water problems. I really have a much more difficult time peeing and my pee smells like pool cleaner even though I'm only drinking water. also, even though I'm drinking a lot of water, my body is behaving like it's dehydrated (which may be why it's harder to pee because my body doesn't want to give up its liquid).

generally speaking mom represents the nosebook force, and so now if you consider the vegetable to be the manifestation (of the girls, my capacity, expansion of my vision, etc.), nosebook is constantly saying, let's cut it off now before it gets too big, and I'm saying ... no, let's wait until we finally have a vegetable that's too big, and then pull back from there.

also, generally speaking, mom represents the cautious, overly worried mindset (it's funny how it feels the same as impatient) -- the spirit of preservation where you have to pull out early or can't go too far because you're affraid, that you could lose it all or it'll be bad in some way.

I like to find the limits, and then from there pull back to what is optimal. I don't have tesla's imagination where I can experiment in my mind and find out the limits in my mind, so I have to figure them out in real-life by trial and error. so, sorry for wanting to experiment to try and optimise.

I suppose, what this means in reality is that I'll find the limit at some point and then nosebook will be faced with watching their entire setup falling apart, so they'll have to separate me out in time or space. this won't be the first time they'll do it, as it's inevitable over the next ~1ky that many others will pose a risk to their setup and will have to be separated in time or space.

---

another dimension: if I keep going the way I'm going without a manifestation, the bandwdith of visible perception will continue to expand, and eventually we'll reach a new octave. when this happens, I believe that the astral will combine with the physical, and expanded vision will be available to everyone, and it'll mean that nosebook will have to find a more effective means of hiding (they're probably going digital and jumping in and out of bodies)

new galaxy: just what it says. if we're separated in time, then it's an inward looking galaxy of many versions of the same star system all with different versions diverging in different ways. if we're separated by space, it's a literal galaxy.

intergalactic planetary: I believe that this new galaxy will retain ties to the milky way and will continue on in communication. I'm not sure what exactly will cause the separation, but they'll be tied together. one galaxy has focus on wanted, and the other galaxy (probably the milky way) will retain its identity as the demiurge where everything needs to be controlled and kept a secret.

that's really where I think all of this is leading. they're not going to ever change their mind to reveal their secret, and I know this. my prodding at mom, remi, and melissa was un purpose. I know they'll never admit it, because they can't, so instead what this is all about is pushing them to dig in so hard that they're willing to take it to very extreme levels. it's bad enough that they could see their whole planetary setup fall apart, but what if they've now been forced to remain in control of, thousands, millions, and perhaps billions of other planets that they've had te separate off because their technology or emotional/conceptual capabilities have become significant enough to threaten penetrating their ruse.

keep holding on to the secret guys! we'll find the limit soon enough.

### 2022-09-07 12:?? - followup: separation of time or space

what do I mean by that? well, if it's space, I've postulated that because you know that we're in a 2nd ray (solar) system, that means that the sun will always be producing a vibration that is something like the big picture. when you think of imagination being a mix of physical and conceptual/emotional, what the sun produces is the same thing, but non-physical -- an image/reality that combines both desire and logic/structure (path toward desire). so what you have is that every time that a desire is made, the sun will produce the vibrations that can make that desire a reality with ever increasing intensity. I believe there is a direct correlation between desire and solar output. the more closer to the desire you are the less solar output and the further you are away from the desire, the higher the solar output. roughly speaking.

now, let's look at the aspects of desire: on one hand you have my desire to get connected before I do anything. you have other desires around to produce new humans, and you have nosebook's desire to ensure that I don't collapse their setup. seemingly, only two of these desires can be fulfilled at one time. my connection appears in conflict with nosebook's desire to keep their secrets and setup (neither the sun or LOA distinguish good or evil -- these are conceptual defintions that we've created), so both desires will become a reality, and in order to do that there needs to be a way that makes it possible (the structure psrt). because we're heading toward individuality, I cannot expect anyone else to be different than they are because they are individual and have nothing to do with me.

I know that I can keep feeling the way I want to feel and keep attracting a reality that reflects how I feel no matter what nosebook is doing, so their desire poses no threat to mine. my desire is unstoppable. however, in their perception, this thing that is continually growing and cannot be stopped is an ever increasing problem for them.

I say separation of space because as long as desire is nearby to the sun (the sun isn't too worried about making other entities in other star systems become a reality), so the more nearby to the sun, the greater the effect of my attraction will have. the more I attract that reality of getting connected, the more the sun will make that possible (hence why every time there is a massive solar storm, I have the kundalini rising, because the sun is making that desire a reality because that state of being refelects how I conceptualise my reality).

there is additionally other factors of my interaction with others on this planet where for some people they're doing really great in a reality that they control, but nearby to me, reality starts to become less controllable, and so they have to stay away from me.

it all adds up to, likely they'll have to get me off of the planet to solve this problem. I would leave the planet by myself, but they don't want me (or anyone else) having that technology, so I continue on here. I've postulated pluto or charon, but I get the strong sense that they have something already setup there and they denfinitely don't want me around threatening their operation.

so, I find it likely that they'll have to separate me in time rather than space. what this means is that I'll go off on my own timeline where (from my perspective) everything is as it already is.

in fact, it's quite likely that I'm already on my own timeline, and everyone that I interact with are a sort of biological robot controlled by nosebook from another timeline. I give it a high possibility and it's my present theory. everyone in my experience is just a copy of their former self acting in accordance with the suggestions of nosebook from the other timeline.

from that new timeline, it's pretty similar to how it already is now in that nosebook won't want me figuring out any "singularity technologies" because then I could begin to manipulate their timeline from mine, so they'll continue to keep me from getting any technology, conditions, or any connection. because of the power of singularity technology and/or conceptual preception (5d+) they all jeopardise something or other, so they have to fight it equally, which means it doesn't matter if this is my own timeline or theirs the result is the same.

personally, I don't really care what they do as for me, my goal is not to try and get anyone (mom, remi, melissa, or nosebook) to try and do anything different. they're just there as actors that I can interact with to get better at feeling the way I want to feel. so, they can do whatever they want to do. I just stir up problems and keep feeling the way I want to feel -- just like that kid. it's funny becuase he transmitted me an image when he was doing it of how embarrassed his mom was of running after him because of her larger size. I notably reacted to this, thinking it came from her, but I think he was very conscious of what he was doing. he also transmitted me another image which explained that his mom was showing him that he would be hit by a car, BUT THERE ARE NO CARS ON THE ROAD. his mom treats him like he's stupid. I felt the resonance with that when arguing with melissa and remi because they were treating me like I'm stupid. they were basically saying to me that all of the technical experience that I've accumulated over the years amounts to nothing and they're going to *tell me* that technology that I know exists does not in fact exist. it's like them telling me I'm going to get run over by cars WHEN THERE ARE NO CARS ON THE ROAD!! lol

so, my job is to not get so bent out of shape about what they say, and I'm still learning that. one day I'll be able to have that discussion with them without even feeling the slightest bit bothered by it. I'll just know that I'm right and dominate the conversation calmly.

---

before I get back into time and space, other major reaction to the last entry was around how all of the earth will be filled with psychopaths, and I don't really understand because it already is. just, most aren't very good at it. the whole point is for everyone to get better at feeling the way that they wanted to feel. this kind of behaviour started out with actors (and everyone wanted to be one), but now with youtube and all other forms of social media, everyone is acting all of the time now. so, because we're all acting all of the time, we're feeling the way that we think the camera (or whomever is going to see the picture/video) wants us to feel. again, that's perfectly fine by me if others want to feel the way that they think others want them to feel.

you can imagine that the web of false realities that everybody is living will become so big that eventually, there will begin to have desire to forget about all of that and just feel the way that you want to feel. that's what happened to me anyway. the amount of discomfort that I felt over trying to remember what to say to who, was so taxing that I had to give it up and just go with saying always what I really thought. at times I withhold information, but *not* so that I can be deceptive, but because it's not necessary or I don't want to explain myself. anything anyone wants to know I'll say what I really believe. I have no reason to be deceptive because there's nothing I can really hide. it may take a while, but I can imagine that many will be like me in the future. it's the only way for oneself to maintain sanity in a giant web of lies.

---

OK, back to separation of time or space again. what I *presently* believe is actually on the horizon to happen, is this: I'll keep going and things will get bigger and bigger and the whole situation will continue to gain more and more difficulty as there becomes a greater schism between what I'm saying and the reality that everyone is under hypnosis to believe. they've tried everything that they can to stop it and one day they either can't keep their secret or I'll find my connection (one of the two), and that's when they'll have to separate me out and put me on another timeline. for the rest of the world this will look as if all of a sudden their desire came to pass. all of a sudden, kenny is behaving properly and not causing any more problems, and the girls thing can happen. that guy isn't me though. to ensure that it doesn't look too suspicious and to limit access to kenny, they'll probably have to put me on another planet (maybe pluto/charon), but that would be to limit interaction with kenny (again this is not me, but another guy that looks and behaves similar to me).

I find it likely that this will be what alice bailey said about this (strangely in the same video of rasputin: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/2_wxMfnGU7c?t=219)) you have 1000y periods (ie. 1024y solar cycles where the sun reaches peak output of creation of desire) and at the peak of that output (which I think will be around 2048), things will begin to return back to normal. anyway alice bailey thinks that a messianic figure would return sometime after 2025. fitting it into my perception of things, you can imagine that if I'm split off on to my own timeline, then this messianic kenny will take my place and bring all of earth into a more stable place.

the solar output will continue to rise though until 2048 so it's not like everything will be solved by this messianic figure, so even then some major alterations will need to be made to everyday life to reduce the effects of the sun. this includes all of the stuff that stephan schwartz is remote viewing and other things like that.

on my timeline (this could even already be happening), it'll also look the same where the whole world will be the same but they'll still be fighting against my getting a manifestation (for the reasons mentioned above). the thing that they're probably most concerned about is not that the girls or any of that happens, but that I get connected, so to try and avoid that, they'll probably try to get me as far away from the sun as possible (less vibration of enabling the manifestation, and also stuck with a bunch of girls). this is in effort to try and keep me away from getting connected (because that's what they really don't want).

so, it's probably both. either way, if you see "me" all of a sudden start playing by the rules, it's not me. my job is not to play by the rules, but to feel the way I want to feel (despite the conditions).

the good news is that all of my "rough edges" will be smoothed over, or maybe he'll pretend that the girls are responsible for all of his sudden changes (again, I'm not like that; I change because I decide to change, not because a pretty girl motivated me to change). the other good news is that because it's not really me, things will no longer continue to accelerate, and it'll feel like everyone can just go back to everyday life.

I figure that nosebook will be global at that point, and this new kenny will try to keep everyone not traveling, not spreading ideas, etc. everyone partitioned into their own parts so that the whole machine can run smoothely. it's good because there won't be a big disaster or anything like that.

everything will be good from then on. the next task that nosebook has will then be to ensure that all advances in technology are not in the direction of individual access to singularity technologies. just imagine how difficult of a job that will be -- and how much influence they'll exert over the psyche of the idividual to be able to ensure that no singularity technologies are developed for the next 1ky until the sun starts ramping up really high again. that's when things are going to be at their most difficult, and that's when I plan to jump back into another body on one or various timelines that they control.

---

hey, I just thought of something... so imagine that you there are a bunch of timelines each split off from their main timeline where each of these timelines is going their own way, but the main timeline is so well locked down that nobody is wanting to develop singularity tech on that timeline -- well, that's the one that I want to jump into and see if I can make it through, because that's the hardest challenge, right?

if I take on all of the hardest challenges (because I like the hardest challenges), and the rest of the timelines are all doing their own thing just fine, I suppose at that point, I would have the opportunity to finally overcome evil (the hardest challenge) once and for all and save those poor souls stuck in such a difficult situation (christ) -- or, I could go back to the formula and instead provide a way once again for evil to gain more power to try and control their reality (a harder challenge), which is sorta the anti-christ vibe a bit. anti-christ is helping the bad-guy and christ is taking the hardest challenge (in this frame of thinking). so, by taking the hardest challenge, I am also kind of "saving" the other ones stuck in such a difficult challenge. interesting thought... I'm done for now...

[1]: it's funny how the word for maintaing a false reality also means "red"

### 2022-09-07 14:40 - on actors and acting

real quick one... I mentioned in the previous entry that we're all acting now, and that's largely to do with social media because when you go on to these various platforms, you're behaving the way the audience wants you to behave. an actor proper will behave the way the script says to behave.

all of this is feeling the way you want to feel, whether its to meet the expectations of the audience or whatever, it's still feeling that way on purpose.

I don't really wish to make any disagreement with that or any other psycopathic behaviour, because I think this is the key to getting what you want, and I think there's a good reason why there's a stong correlation between actors and attracting the things that they want -- because they're more used to modifying the way that they feel.

the better someone get at modifying the way that they feel, the more likely that they'll be attracting more often than pushing away. have you ever wanted something that you felt like you couldn't have or was just out of reach? that's attracting and pushing away at the same time. so if the script says that you need to feel like the perfect amazing whatever is coming, the actor is able to just feel that way, without actually seeing the manifestion of it or even considering that to be a part of the real life.

what you conceptualise to be a part of your reality is something like playing a script. you're told in the script that you need to act like something really good (or bad) is going to happen, and if you do that well enough, the film is believable, but if not it looks really not-genuine. so, that's why there are those LOA things on "scripting" where you write the things that are going to happen and then start pretending like you feel those to be true until they start coming true, right? fake it till you make it.

---

there's another aspect to acting that has to do with maintaining a false reality, and I see that actors know this all too well, where the maintenance of a false reality or image to a number of people is quite taxing. I see all the time these breakdowns, and it feels to me like they're just so tired of having to perform the way that others want them to, and they want to start feeling the way *they* want to feel, rather than how the camera expects them to feel.

feeling the way you want to feel *for other people* is different than feeling the way you want to feel *for yourself*.

### 2022-09-09 08:07 - manifestation of what I want vs manifestation of what others want

one of the things that I woke up this morning thinking about was a reaction to what I wrote about two entries ago, where I was saying that eventually I will be removed and another will take my place, and he'll be the manifestation of what you guys want.

I base that idea on how incompatible I am with nosebook's setup, that at some point, I'm fairly certain that they'll have to neutralise my effects in some way. I've postulated in the past that this is the whole object of the girls, because they're there to provide physical pleasure in exchange for me following the rules/expectations of me. if that were how it worked, then I'd probably still be with raquel (or with another similar, because that's usually the arrangement in a relationship). though it is possible that I could be mesmerised by girls for a short period of time, it'll only be a little bit before I *must* start to do something else. raquel underestimated this about me when she thought that I was cheating on her, when in reality I only just wanted to use my computer. I had been using my computer for such a large portion of my life, that she, being my first girlfriend, I didn't really have a concept that I should be spending all my time with her instead of with my computer. if I had've known that after moving in with her, I wouldn't be able to use my computer (something I did for nearly 100% of my time, minus drinking). I don't see this as any different either. girls just aren't that fascinating, as they typically don't really want to talk about anything of importance.

just imagine how much I talk about my thoughts here, and about nosebook. if I were now, no longer able to do that, and now I had to express all of these ideas to them instead, that would cause many many problems. just notice how large of a difficulty it was to talk about a small subject I bring up here with remi and you can imagine that the more taboo ones would be even worse. I simply cannot imaggine myself staying too long in a situation like that. I crave novelty and girls are definitely *not novel*; they've been done millions of times over, and (IMO) there's not much new to explore -- and, if there is -- it's probably taboo or unwanted by nosebook. I must find a creative outlet, and girls don't really have anything to do with that. just pay attention to all interactions that I've had with girls and women in the last 5 years, and it's been very seldom that I talk about anything exciting (though, my recent conversation with jeri was pretty interesting). nosebook does not want me to be creative or to talk about anything that can expand the mind, so you can see how their desire for a manifestation is just to keep me occupied with pleasure.

---

so, because what I want is so incompatible with what nosebook wants, they have to make the manifestation that everyone wants happen on their terms, not mine. I imagine that over the years now of presenting me to the world, they've gotten pretty good at knowing what sorts of things people like and what people don't like, so they'll do that. if you think of it in terms of a hollywood movie, they've probably figured out the kenny formula pretty well by now and they know what gets the reactions that they (and the viewers) want.

so, what this is is a bit of a battle over the difference between what I want, what nosebook wants, what the girls want, and what the viewers want. I say "battle" because that's the way it probably appears, but in reality it's all attraction. what I attract is what I give my attention to and how I feel.

so, for example remi and melissa are on the frequency of abduction, so to them it's quite possible that it would look to them like I'm trying to abduct or take their child away. in fact, that may (educated guss) have been what they were just talking about with each other right before I showed up -- and it may have been related to them noticing that I'm constantly attracted to things (like the blanket) that make that further a reality. it feels like there was also a bit of disliking how disruptive to their traditional methods of affecting behaviour, and so that by focusing in that way, they manifested that kid's interaction with me. they're getting exactly what they want. they desire more of that because that's what they're tuned to.

I attract things based on how they feel, so that's why I felt like the blanket was something I wanted when I got home.

another thing to notice is that there are further attractions, and if you've been paying any attention to the different feelings that I conjure at the end of meditating, I am attracting interactions based on those feelings. there isn't much that someone can do about that, because they're on that feeling vibration. so, for example when I conjure a condescending feeling, I'm attracting that, so then when remi starts telling me that she knows the state of technology better than me, it's got that condescending feeling to it. same with the mother of that kid that was telling the kid that he has no concept of how cars in the road work.

a good example of this seen from remi's perspective is an event where I had always placed my chair in the wrong spot for greg, and he most certainly was noticing this more and more until I left it right in his way and he broke it. none of this was purposeful on my part, but I was resonant with his attraction so the chair got broken. in the same way, I'm attracting condescension, and remi is resonant with that, so without even thinking about it, that's the tone that she takes. there's nothing she can really do about it. she has no way to affect what I'm attracting.

another example, but from my perspective: in spain, I would often walk in the middle of the street, and I would notice that there would be a rising feeling of concern by others that I would get run over (it's one of the ways I knew that my vision was being broadcasted). I always had this sense of feeling danger, and so if I walked out into the street in my mind's eye, and I didn't feel danger, I was fine (I didn't even need to look), but if I felt danger when my mind's eye started to walk into the street, then I didn't do it. anyway, I noticed the concern for my streetwalking continue to rise. I kept up my way of doing things where I walked out if I felt OK, and sure enough, the other people's attraction made for a few pretty close calls where the car was very close to me or a pretty big asusto. they got what they attracted, but because I never felt danger, I didn't get hit or anything. both attractions were satisfied.

eventually, if their attraction were to become so strong that they *must* have a reality where I got run over, then they would eventually get that reality. I would either make a miraculous recovery (because I'm attracting well-being), or whatever -- but that's not a very extreme case and I can recover from those sorts of things really quickly. however, if it were extreme enough of a difference in attraction, like being stuck in a reality where I'm devoted only to pleasure and have nothing novel or mentally stimulating, then I would imagine that I would do like I always do which is to start causing problems until I finally peace out.

### 2022-09-09 16:41 - stuck in the box

I just woke up, and I don't really remember any specific dreams or anything like that but one of the things that popped into my head early on was ... I was thinking about kyle and his daughter and there was an impression on me wondering if I would like to go over there or something like that. I can't really tell if these things are nosebook trying to figure out how to move me around cause it's possible that my presence here on this street is causing problems. like, imagine if you're remi or others, they would feel like they need to avoid me for fear that I bring up the previous conversation that I had with them.

it would fit with the vibe because after the previous entry, there was a considerable amount of reactions around noticing that not only was I right that the abduction vibration did match their previous conversation, and so if they're that transparent to me, then possibly it's a good idea for me to go somewhere else where I wouldn't be considered in the same vibration as abducting their kids. the solution is always conditional.

when I was younger, I couldn't figure out how to make certain things happen (like programming) so I would perpetually change my conditions in order to try and find some inspiration -- like go to get a coffee or go to get a whiskey or whatever, and by changing the setting and my conditions, I would feel better, but it didn't solve the underlying problem.

this is exactly the same thing. they can try and move me around and stuff changing the conditions, but it's not solving the problem of the serious desync that nosebook has with me. they've probably been manipulating the broadcasts so much that what people see is very different, and so probably figure the best way to keep their ruse going is to isolate me so that I'm not interacting with too many people and they can go back to just showing small bits that they know will resonate with the person (omitting the stuff they won't like). that's what I think is happening on the surface.

---

however, my reaction to wanting to know if I would want to go down there was much different than that, whicch is what I'll explain here. I've sorta committed to the "worst" manifestation possible, and that manifestation unfortunately sounds pretty good.

when I talk about the "worst" manifestation, let me explain that I don't have any specific goal for it, but at the moment it already looks pretty awful, and here's why.

let's just say for a moment that what ends up happening is the "box" manifestation I referred to a few entries back when outside on the side of their house I started to receive reactions about why would I want to allow other non-virgins into the group, and my response to it not being something that bothered me...

I just noticed something while writing that and those reactions and the feeling that came around when remi suddenly had to come to the house (presumably to pick up allie) felt *very similar* to the conversation that remi was having with melissa right before the abduction subject. it felt as if remi was complaining that my presence forces her to have to run over to pick up allie in "emergency situations" such as that one. I guess I'm a pretty big problem to have around because of my telepathic caabilities -- and so if that was what happened, her complaining about it with melissa attracted me to come over in just that moment so things can get far worse... lol.

back to where I was... I was talking about the "box" manifestation -- and the synopsis of it is that there are various ages of girls and the older ones give birth to children and these become the future mates of the younger ones. let's just assume that's the future for sake of this discussion.

I consider that to be the "worst" manifestation because even if say there were 4 girls that were able to be impregnated every day (~4 children per day), that would be an output of ~1.5k children per year (being *very* optimistic), which is fine I guess, so that would mean that there are also at least that many girls which at at a rate of having sex with each of them only once per year it still means 4 per year. that sounds like an awful lot of work.

I don't even have a way to really conceptualise that, and the only way that I can really see it happening is that that guy is not me. I have no way of knowing what my my libido would be like after I get connected, but in my present state of mind, I find that idea to be pretty horrifying. it basically means I'm putting all of my creative energy into creating children and stuff. I dunno about that.

but, just for argument's sake, let's just assume that works out somehow, and let's also assume that this eventually becomes the "seed for the next root-race" or something as far out as that. I say that because if it is, or if the children are superior to normal humans in any way, then you can expect the archons/fallen-angels to be highly attracted to these bodies. they'll be most interested in trying to get into these bodies. that's what I think is happening below the surface -- and that it's essentially a breeding program to get new bodies for the fallen-angels.

---

the other aspect to this, is the one that I mentioned in reference to de vere and (at least) the first 17 sonnets -- where you could imagine him as one of the fallen-angels reaching through time trying to convince me to have earthly children, and not only heavenly ones. I know that nosebook definitely does not want any earthly children, as it would mean that there would be a spread of people that have my capacity. it would be like if jesus' bloodline was mixed in with the normal plebs, and not contained only within the elites. that would be a huge problem.

personally, I don't believe I'm from jesus' bloodline, so any and all genetic upgrades that I have were created by me with my own mental capablities. if I can do it, so can everyone else. I think it's perfectly fine if only the elites get access to my genetics, because then it actually forces people to come to their own way to accomplish that perception, rather than getting it through bloodlines.

if you've been following my work on [the fifth gospel](/steiner/fifth-gospel.md), you're probably fitting the pieces together now and rnalising that science had advanced so much because (assuming that happened), the pentecost gave the normal plebs access to clairvoyance (4d), but the elites (the church) got access to conceptual (5d) and potentially higher forms of perception as well. so, with all three sides (spiritual, scientific, and archons/church) getting upgrades, the battle was on and it produced a number of new advances in technology, despite the perpetual wars and things of that nature.

---

it may look like you want to have some set of conditions, but the reality is you really want to find it for yourself.

in short, the "worst" manifestation looks to me like a breeding program to ensure that the archons get the best bodies again. their efforts to remain superior will eventually produce a diversity of new ways to accomplish the same thing. there isn't any single on way to get there.

I'm probably here for their sake more than anyone else's.

### 2022-09-12 11:12 - rethinking things

so, yesterday got a chance to think about a lot of things. I come away from it feeling pretty depressed. I don't really know why I feel so much depression. it may not even be my own depression either. so I [planned out to do a few things](/metal-lucifer.md#2022-09-11-1158---the-plan), and then only did one of them (tweet at trump) and I did it too hastily. I didn't even put enough thought energy into what I wanted to say and it came out a bit wrong. I haven't checked twitter to see if there are any replies, and I kinda don't want to, either.

that may be the origin of the depression, is that I get involved in politics -- which is a pretty rough subject for a lot of people. like, if I were to have any positive relations with trump would probably be a pretty awful thing for a lot of people. maybe.

---

the other thing that kinda bothered me is there was this one point yesterday where ... first, let me back up. you have to understand that there are a lot of really good ideas that are potential realities and anyone can take any one of the realities that they want to. as in, imagine if yesterday had've gone differently -- that's one possible reality and it does exist and there are probably a portion of people's consciousness on that timeline.

OH, that's a weird thing. I was getting some confusion/quetions as to what I mean by timeline, so I'll just explain that really quick.

---

the way I like to look at it is that every time that you have a negative emotion or desire for something, this signal creates a whole lot of other parallel realities, and they all exist simultaneously, so that you could say that in any moment, everything that is possible to happen is happening. however, just because it's all happenining doesn't mean that's what you're seeing. the reality that you're tuned to is a reflection of how you feel and how you conceptualise your world. my consciousness (presently) cannot perceive more than one timeline at the moment, so it looks to me like I'm stringing these words together to form sentences in a linear sequential way. time appears to me to be unfolding gradually.

everyone behaves as a reflection of their conditions, therefore if you only are a reflection of your conditions, you are just a biological machine (kinda like an insect) just reacting whatever way you've been taught to react. so, everyone of the other "you" on the timelines is behaving exactly as expected. when you choose to do something other than than the default reaction, then you're literally *choosing* to tune to a different timeline. you may think of this as a decision, but I think it's a poor analogy. here's why:

there are three doors, one has a large prize, a medium, and a small. I can *choose* any one of those doors, but that probably didn't modify how I look at my family or friends very much, and if it did, like let's say I'm scared of them taking my prize from me or something; *that* is what made the timeline different, not the prize itself. if I feel like my family is taking my stuff, any infinite number of manifestations can make me feel that way and so therefore they all satifsy how I feel, the three doors are all the same timeline essentially.

now, let's say that those prizes were cash and they allowed the winner large medium and small lifestyle changes. that's just the magnitude of the event, though the timeline is the same. it's actually slightly different because the manifestation is slightly different, but the manifestation still feels like my family is going to take some of my prize money (which is why I see them as the same). the more money the prize, the larger that reality of family taking the money will be. the reality that "my family will take my money" is how I conceptualise it to be and so therefore it reflects it.

choice has nothing to do with what timeline you're consciously perceiving. my view of timelines differs slightly from jason's because he says that if everything possible already exists, then there is no human agency or free-will. I disagree, because it's your desire that creates all of those realities. it's the most creative aspect of them, which means that the only goal is to figure out how to *tune* to the reality that I want.

---

OK, back to where I was... I was saying that every one of these different alternate manifestations are all alternate timelines that anyone can easily tune to (we won't know you're gone because you'll behave exactly as we expect you to), and you can get there by actually believing that is reality. when I say believe, I mean believe as in I believe the keys under my finger are solid along with my chair and other such things. I *believe* them to be solid, and so they are. you're reading this now because your believe of reality is somehow compatible with mine and my version of reality is more attractive than your own (we tend to gravitate to the realities of others that are more attractive).

OOPS, derailed again. alternate realities that anyone can access if they want to, and so what I was seeing is that all of those valid other realities will eventually merge with our own when we're going to have the *real* singularity. I can see the technological one on the horizon, but you know what I could see is that all of these alternate timelines will produce more novelty seekers. it's *inevitable* (no matter what periodicity) that eventually all novelty-seekers are on the same timeline -- but let's just say like 80% of them are all in the same timeline...

this would be like the equinox of novelty theory, where, for one period of time there are a whole lot of these novelty seekers all over the place realising new things at one time.

this seems obvious to me that if nature seeks novety and produces novelty, they'll attract one another and eventually all end up in the same timeline. why? because I know that with for example jason in the same timeline as me, I'm going to make realisations of new things even faster there than I would if I were elsewhere.

up until the singularity this clumping of novelty-seekers is periodic because you can make a realisation from seeing awful things just as easily you can with seeing something you like too.

yesterday I perceive novelty as a series of realisations (aha moments), tim leary called this your "rpm" (revelations per minute). those realisations break you out of habit and out of doing the same thing.

I just want to say that this singularity won't happen for a while though because there is a lot of awful stuff that are ripe for producing more realisations of the improvement or how awful it is -- so, I believe it's actually pretty likely that we're not going to hit the novelty singularity until there isn't much more awful stuff anymore.

obviously you can't get rid of all awful stuff, so what instead is changing is the perspective of the awful stuff, which itself is a novel perspective. after the "awful" stuff isn't perceived as awful anymore, the only way to continue to get more novelty is to interact with other novely-inspirers (chaos) and novelty-seekers.

what I mean is, it seems pretty obvious to me that the really really end-game singularity is when we're all attracting each other cause we crave more novelty and the conditions alone aren't sufficient enough.

---

woah, long intro there. OK, so what I really wanted to talk about was this point where yesterday I was going thruogh all of those realisations about novelty and stuff like that and I was explaining that all of those are great timelines that others can try out and eventually merge back into this timeline (cause we're going to merge anyway in the novelty singularity), and so while they're job is to get people to believe in that alternate timeline enough so that they can go that way, my job is to just keep going forward how I am.

it's a kind of irony because my insistence on remaining in my habit is actually causing one of the highest amount of novelty right now for others. if I were to go with the girls, it's pretty likely that novelty will drop pretty quickly.

---

then there was this other thing that I woke up thinking about, because yesterday one of the things that I was preoccupied with was seeing these layers of static electricity in the feet of the flies that landed on me. one of these static layers could envelop a person so they could walk in rain and not get wet, which is like really nice. but, as usual with these guys, the idea gets turned into another way to increase (or decrease) pleasure.

you could imagine that if you were to build up enough of these layers ... so think of one layer as being vibrationally attracted to the fly's foot. it attracts and repels at the same static electricity frequency, so that field "hovers" over the fly's foot. when the fly lands on me, the fly adjusts that layer so that it attracts the frequency of my skin (or the wall, or whatever) probably by having a sensor and feedback loop. it then attracts and repels that new surface just the same. when it wants to fly again, it turns off the attract and the repel puts it into the air. I could see that the fly never actually touches anything it lands on.

so now imagine the force field that the fly has on its feet now like a condom. you make one layer very close to the skin at one frequency, then another layer just above that one attracting and repelling the layer below it, and so fourth. each layer can slide really well, so you have a condom that can expand and attract frequentially, and you never actually touch the other person -- ever, just like the fly never touches you.

when I woke up I was thinking about this, and though that idea is pretty cool, I'm probably not going to be in control of it, so that means that I'll never actually really touch any of the girls anyway.

I could also see yesterday that using the same feedback loop that the fly has on its feet to maintain its attration/repulsion from the surface, a similar technique could be used to "neutralise" any frequencies that the girls are putting out as well.

the final thing that I noticed is that this idea also has some interesting ideas. I'll say it the way I saw it. there was a whole bunch of guys that are really "awful" and if they were to start a virgin out, then he would "defile her" or in some way severely damage her energetically. they obviously know more about this than I do so that must be a real thing, and the implication there is that certain dudes have a very strong negative effect on girls. however, with this idea, because they never touch and everything can be neutralised, they can modify the energy that they're putting out sexually -- without changing the way they feel. all of the really "bad-guys" can now enjoy all of the young virgins that they want and not have to worry as much about the energetic damage. I guess that's a good thing, right? (I haven't actually thought it through much[^1])

I was kinda bothered with a fly that was digging holes into my arm while I was to smoking and started to see how its feet work. that fly also reminded me that an easy way to embed nosebook "inserts" under people's skin is to use insects and other such things that land on us all the time.

---

anyway, the strong feeling that I come away with on this one is that I feel pretty good about the make china great again idea. that's all for now. maybe I'll gain enough courage to go on twitter and see if I started any fires. lol

[1]: I can think it through a bit. it's all about perception and nothing in itself is inherently good or bad, so if she likes him, but he doesn't like himself, he will have not passed on that self-hatred to her, but she probably didn't do anything to improve him. it just allows him to go more time down the road without changing it. quick note, what happens during sex is the same thing that happens all of the other time, just there those waves are at a higher amplitude between those two people. you can pick up someone's vibration much more powerfully with a sexual interaction, or by living in the same space with them for an extended period of time. the attraction is the same, so it's still 100% what he attracts, but the interaction could be a good example of her "seeing what she wants to see" or "feeling what she wants to feel" (regardless of the conditions). I don't think it's bad, and the only impression that I have is this is sorta like going for months on the spare tire. the risk is much higher for another blowout and this time you won't have a spare. it's kicking the can down the road, which usually doesn't work out too well, but in itself, probably isn't bad. it's all attraction anyway; even the ones that were "defiled".
