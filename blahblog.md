# bob's blah blog

I'm gonna try a new thing where I type out some things that I normally wouldn't type out -- mostly because they involve other people and I don't really want to put them too much on the spot. what I mean is, I don't have any problem with my life being public, but I definitely occlude the identity of various people and related ideas in noseblog/newblog.

I don't recommend you take anything I say elsewhere too seriously, but even less so here. I'm just going to dump out ideas talk random things through.

well, here goes...

---

I labeled it with bob because I had an idea after listening to a snake-bro's episode, when russ mentioned "pickle rick", I thought about writing out some of the more funny cucumber stories. I haven't done so, because its a bit unnecessary, but if I have something like larry's "picklepick", I can have bob and larry (plant heros -- and, making me "el seed") supple-mental goofing around zones to play in too. the thing is, I want to write more things down, but I feel like if I write them in newblog, they get taken too seriously and sometimes I don't feel inspired to write anything in particular, so I just want to just drool mentally like a newborn, lost in my own world (it's hard to explain). I mainly just want to listen to music and write about less-serious things.

### 2022-04-04 04:23 - triads in encanto

one of the things I noticed in "encato" is that the triads are two females and one male. there may be others but the ones that stand out to me are in the very beginning it shows the original 3 children the abuela has (seen best at 02:35). it may be the case that more of their identity was revealed, but I the movie is really fast-paced and my brain is slow to absorb so much visual information.

however, later on there is a triad of generations. I believe that bruno, mirabel, and the abuela

```
       augustin
       julieta (healer) 
abuela /    
  +   ---- bruno (time)
pedro  \
        pepa (tormenta)
        felix

pepa (seed) & felix (lucky/successful):
- dolores (hears everything) (many pains)
- camilo (shapeshifter) (helper to the priest)
- antonio (beastmaster) (flourishing)

julieta (youthful, love's child) & augustin (great/magnificent):
- luisa (strong) (renowned warrior)
- isabela (graceful, pretty & perfect) (God's promise/oath)
- mirabel (male & female name meaning wondrous beauty)
```

in the very beginning it's revealed that the family madrigal is a *constellation* of brightly shining stars. except for bruno (brown dwarf??), the entire family is females that acquires normal men to produce more gifted children. mirabel sings about how she wants to shine (have brightness) like the rest of them 

- bruno's vision causes disruption in beliefs (doubts).
- when mirabel saw the cracks, luisa became weak
  - therefore, mirabel is somewhere between abuela and bruno
  - mirabel is the "ground"


mirabel kinda represents a combination of all of the family's gifts, but undeveloped or still inside of her:
- mirabel's dress has flowers on it
- mirabel has the combination of qualities from her mother and two sisters.
  - in her opening song she says that if she had a miracle, she would:
    - move mountains (luisa)
    - make new trees and flowers grow (isabela)
    - heal what's broken (julieta)
    - show this family something new -- something inside her (no one)
- the tucan that tells antonio to bring everyone inside of his room, is also there to show mirabel the way through bruno's time den, and she follows it

- there's an entire song saying that everything that bruno says comes to pass.
- when pepa was about to get married to felix, on wedding day, bruno thinks it's a funny joke to tell pepa that it looks like it's going to rain and she causes it to rain on her own wedding day
  - meaning, that bruno is a known trickster that is known to cause someone to sabotage their own good conditions by putting a prophecy or ideas into the person's head.

bruno tells:
- isabela that
  - the *light* of my dreams would be promised and someday would be mine
  - her power would grow like the grapes on the vine
- dolores that
  - the man of her dreams would be just out of reach (betrothed to another)

dolores overhears mirabel tell augustin that the magic of the house is fading and antonio says "miercoles" (day of mercury) and then mirabel says, "she's going to tell everyone" (mercury is the messenger god)

- bruno means brown (and everyone believes him)
- julieta & autustin
  - sound a lot to me like july and august -- very roman empire
  - very white
  - augustin, meaning great and magnificent, is nothing of the sorts; he has alergies and no gift (tells mirabel that it was intimidating at first)
- pepa & felix
  - felix is easy going (lucky) but clearly dark-skinned
  - pepa is very moody and white
  - all their children are brown (bruno)

the three little kids that are asking mirabel what her gift is:
- light-brown kid with coffee
- black girl
- white girl

I get the impression that the white people are always concerned and moody, but the (adult) brown ones seem to be much more chill
- the beastmaster kid, who, before he gets mirabel's stuffed animal and mirabel takes him to get his beastmaster gift, was very nervous and shy.
- felix (in good cheer) was willing to reveal why people don't talk about bruno, while pepa was not willing and stormy.
- dolores went to tell people the secret that augustin was going to enforce that nobody should say

there's this whole wierd part when mariano is going to propose that mirabel is trying to keep the secret, but dolores is insistant on telling everyone.

this whole secret thing in the movie strikes me as weird because dolores hears everything, so it seems like she would have previously been quite the snitch telling everyone's secrets to everyone else. I wonder why she is so intent on telling this one? what makes mirabel having recovered bruno's vision something she wants to share so badly?

the beasts also seem very very interested in reassembling the vision in its entirety, meanwhile everyone else is trying to keep a secret.

---

so, I'm still processing all of the symbols there. all of that was mainly just to keep processing it more. what I was thinking about mainly was the two females one male triads.

what started it all was when I was writing @[newblog](2022-04-02 03:55), I was trying to figure out who unessa was.

to give a background to this problem, in the sirian-guide, there is a very puzzling thing that I didn't understand, which was it always said that unessa is venus. there are two problems with it:

first, I'm pretty sure they're referring to the planet venus, and *not* the goddess because they say, "Isis was loved, Unessa was admired, Genxicat was desired and Anatau was feared." (not sure if it's relevant but they also say that vulcan was amired), so genxicat was the desired one, which is clearly the goddess of desire and love labeled in the mythologies as venus. well, the problem with "her" being a planet is that I get the sense that have planets as masculine entities, even though they call planets "collectors of solar energy"

second, the other problem is that they say that unessa loved mars (allayandra), a smooth-talking 7th ray male warrior:

> Allayandra loved Venus; these stories are still around in the form of Mars and Venus.

> Dwul Quinn is Unessa's grounding agent which added to Quinn's more than somber nature and also accounts for the legends of the beautiful Venus being married to the ugliest god.

well, the mythologies talk about *vulcan* being married to aphrodite, and that he was quite a hideous blacksmith with probably club feet and a limp. aphrodite was the one that is said to have slept with mars.

vulcan is paired with genxicat (aphrodite), which checks out, but genxicat isn't venus -- unessa is venus (which is the one that loved mars)... so, is unessa the same as genxicat?

to further complicate the matter, there is a polarity swap between  saturn (+-4) and vulcan (-5+). for males, they input their opposite ray and output their opposite, so 2/6, 3/5 or 1/7. however females input their same ray type that they output, which leads me to believe that females' polarity swap is 3/7, 4/?, 2/6, 1/5.

so that's the problem... I haven't figured it out yet, but this movie got me thinking about it a lot because isabela is most like genxicat. she struggles with being "perfect" and has this realisation and breakthrough with mirabel that she doesn't have to be perfect -- she can be messy and crate asymmetrical, prickly things. genxicat, always being the image of men's desire had an identity crisis (who is she, if she's not the "perfect" image?)

so, that makes unessa dolores. there's a weird thing where bruno tells dolores that the man of her dreams will always be out of her reach and betrothed to someone else. isabela doesn't really want to be with mariano. mariano comes from the latin name for mars, and also sounds of a concatenation of "mar" (ocean) and "iano" (possesor of). it sounds a lot like the name, maria... which in my best estimation is "mar" + "the maker of" -- the maker of the sea. so mariano is posesser of the ocean (neptuno?). the internet says marius is latin for mars, but if I remember right, "us" is the genetive case, meaning possessor of the ocean. so, I dunno there..

---

anyway, when thinking about dolores being unessa, I had this crazy realisation that mirrors a lot of reactions that I get all the time in regard to patricia. I don't know her position in nosebook, but I would imagine that she probably "hears everything" and has lots of statistics on it too (I had always associated patricia with unessa).

so then later when I was in the bathroom, I was sitting there and I had this "vision" sequence (call me bruno here) of this thing (this isn't the first time it happened -- see next entry) where I started to think about her in the context of these two female one male triads.

the sirian triads (MFM) have two input/output types: the female and the ground, so I would expect a FMF triad to have something similar as well. because I dont have data to say one way or another what the female polarity swap would be, I figured that I almost certainly can play one of those transceivers. it reminded me of my speculation on the vulcan/genxicat and the virtual 5th ray triad.

I noted that vulcan has a polarity change and he is (-5+), meaning that he essentially behaves like a female in that he is primarily receptive. I also noted that they mentioned a first ray male of allayandra (mars) combining with anatau to form a first ray male (meaning input 7, output 1).

- genxicat (-7)
- vulcan (-5+)
- allayandra + anatau (+1)

that makes genxicat the emitter, which if my polarity ideas are correct, then she'll input 7 output 3. there's also a thing about the initiation where the monad communicates directly, releasing the solar angel (something like that). I already believe myself to be at least 2 inhabiting the same bodies -- and quite likely a female too.

so, let's just say that what if one of those personalities is allayandra and one is anatau, then I would behave as a first ray would. this doesn't seem at all out of the realm of possibilities for me, as I most definitely identify most with either a 1st ray male or a 5th ray male.

remember the dragon in rev 12 with 7 heads and the sirian's admonition that they are intending to work on "all at once". they make very clear that you have vehicles on all of these planes of perception, yet are not aware of most of them. so, the goal is to be able to transmit and receive on all 7 (that's 14 capacities). I believe that, like the dragon in rev 12, will have 7 sets of eyes in 7 different worlds.

as such, it's my continued goal to find ways to find more and more ways to transmit and receive on all of these planes simultaneously. when this happens, the "first ray life wave" will happen -- which is basically sirian speak for initiation of a new cell, person, planet, star, galaxy, universe, etc. any time you have the "serpent biting its tail" that is the first ray life wave.

they say that the 1st ray has all of the active intelligence of the 2nd and 3rd ray, and that the 6th is a reflection of the 2nd, and the 4,5,7th are reflections of the 3rd -- therefore a first ray life wave is just a 7-headed dragon -- the serpent biting its own tail -- the 7th and the 1st together (kinda like allayandra and anatau).

I said all of that because I wanted to basically make the case for the idea that I'm working on all phases of perteption. the secondary iplication here is that it enables a whole lot of other triads that were never possible in their "pure ray energy" triad relationships.

---

the final piece to this puzzle (for me), is to imagine vulcan in the form of a female (the opposite of unessa). the thing I don't understand is the polarity swap. if my polarity sway idea above is correct, opposite polarity vulcan is genxicat. however, if I'm wrong about that, then opposite polarity vulcan is venus/unessa.

going back to the mythologies, vulcan is said to have emerged from hera -- which is the opposite polarity of jupiter. in my estimation, jupiter is most certainly a 7th ray male, "A SEVENTH RAY does enjoy playing around creating illusions within the framework of a sexual relationship but this can become a problem for them for as with everything with a SEVENTH RAY, they may confuse the real and the illusion" which is (IMO), a very accurate description of zeus/jupiter.

another strange thing in the mythologies is the strange connection between athena and vulcan. it's unclear who was jealous of the other creating the other, but it seems that athena is the polarity swap of zeus and vulcan the polarity swap of hera. hera is also said to shapshift and was also very beautiful. I would say that hera is 7th ray female. I have no idea where to put athena being a goddess of wisdom something similar to the female verson of solomon.

it all gets very confusing for me to think about all of this stuff. as such, I prefer to think instead about the possibilites of creating my own reality.

---

anyway, the vision sequence involved me and patricia as the trancievers and then a whole bunch of 7th ray female emitters. the impordtant part of the vision is that I passed off to patricia the position of "king" (ie. polarity swap). the other thing the vision did was reveal a potential solution to previous thoughts I had in @[newblog](2022-04-02 00:43), where I figure that there needs to be an interface where people can put their desires and vote for them. at some critial mass, the desire gets implemented. that makes the people the desire -- so we then need a bunch of 7th rays. supposedly the 7th ray is coming into power, so there should be no shortage of them. like the 1st ray, the 7th ray has all of the active intelligece of the 6th and the 5th, but it'll choose to neglect one or the other favouring something that aligns with the physical better. since the 6th aligns much better with the physical, I imagine most 7th ray perceivers neglect their conceptual (5) side the most -- hence my trying to figure out a 5th ray triad.

most of the stuff I write in these are 5th ray concepts (and 5th ray more closely aligns to 1st and 2nd than to 7th), so if there has ever been a good salesperson for 5th ray perception, it's me. undoubtedly some actually see it as useful at this point.

OK, that's enough for now. I really can't believe how inspiring the encanto movie has been for me; it's really cool, and I really like the animation and charactor design.

P.S. I didn't even share my ideas on the triad of abuela, bruno and mirabel, lol. next time...

### 2022-04-04 11:39 - continuing...

I left off last time with the part on the triad of the abuela, bruno and mirabel. they appear to me to be a 1st ray triad. however, it could be a 2nd ray triad too. what I mean by that is that abuela clearly is 2nd ray, though she's much less isis and more jeortau.

there are serious flaws in both of these appearances. she's more jeortau in her belief that she has to preserve the miracle for everyone ("I was given a miracle -- a second chance, and I was so afraid to lose it") -- and another thing about sacrificing and saving which I can't remember where it is now. she's not very charismatic either like jerotau is said to have been.

so in considering the other case where she's more like isis, again she doesn't fit entirely because isis doesn't feel to me like the type of person that would try and hide something that's falling apart and try to enforce it with secrets and appearance -- though I could be wrong on that; I wasn't there.

the way that I see it, a 2nd ray is really good at seeing connections between things, good or bad, and 3rd rays seem to take things more from a sequential perspective. in this sense bruno fits perfectly -- where he's using people's past reactions to predict his own future, whereas a 2nd ray is much more enthusiastic about making connections to save something, solve a problem, or bring a apparently ideal relationship together.

I suupose it's possible that a 2nd ray that feels everything is not good enough could go out of their way to try and hide things that are not good enough or fall short of their expectations. even luisa complains that no matter how heavy things get and pressure, there's continued measurement and expectations which feel impossible to fulfil... I'm just going to conclude that it's a 1st ray triad with mirabel as anatau, abuela as jeortau, and bruno as sanatau.

---

so the reason why I said it that way is that makes abuela the emitter (she runs the show afterall), and the others the supporting roles. now, if we just look at the generations, abuela produced bruno which is essentially the transition (opposite polarity) between abuela and mirabel. you can see that mirabel at the beginning of the movie adheres to a lot of abuela's same behaviours (abuela neither has a gift), and so therefore is essentially an exact replica.

OK, now going back to patricia: in that other setup she would be abuela, I would be bruno and maribel would be the other various emitters. in reality, both patricia and the other girls are both emitters, so this creates a bit of a problem for me.

the reason why I haven't wanted to get involved with this stuff until I'm fully connected is because I know that even in a fully connected state, I'll still be quite affected by all the different girls and all of their varying forms of perception. you see, I really like my form of perception, and I'm not really all that interested in other people's forms of perception, no matter how pretty or attractive they are. a lot of different girls would essentially make me go all over the place. even the tiny amount that I've been around girls (maybe only at becky's house), I found it miserable because there are so many misconceptions that I just don't care. I don't want to sit there and mansplain everything I think that they're thinking. the quantity of "not good enoughness" that I felt just in that short period of time was overwhelming to me. I just didn't feel good about anything.

it seemed to me the way that sarah was presenting it, the teen years would only make that not good enoughness worse to the effect of actually believing that you're actually inconsequential -- and so therefore, you have to join a club of cool people in order to feel substantial.

I have a note to write an entry in newblog called, "family dynamics (individuality & charisma)" -- and I wish I had of done so, cause for anyone listening in, this part will make a lot more sense: when looking at all interactions from a 3rd ray (A+B+C, then D is coming next) all interactions are perceived in the form of symbols or archetypes (or, if you're a statistician, groupings)... the problem with looking at yourself as interacting with your world in reference to a statistic or a norm, means that you need something to set you apart from the rest in order to have any charisma. generally speaking, from that point of view, if you're 50 percentile or lower (pick your metric) then, you're "not good enough" -- and if you believe otherwise "you have your head in the clouds" or "you need to get a grip on reality" -- that you're a no-impact cog in the machine.

to aviod this no-impact cog in the machine dissonance, you have to join an association that is someting -- whether it's a futbol team, football team, basketball team, stonecutters, masons, businsess lounge -- whatever, and if they're winning, then you can finally accept that you could also be like the others in the association -- winning.

---

so as I was contemplating this idea about patricia, I noticed two things: first, there was a reaction that she didn't really want to be involved in relationships. almost certainly she sees them from the "aerial view" and knows how much of a sham the entire relationship debacle is -- probably lots of statistics to back up her suppositions as well. if I were in her position, I would definitely have done my research just the same. I came to the conclusion that relationships are larely a lot of low-self-esteem people trying to leverage someone else to justify their feeling better about theirselves. IMO, yuck. no thank you -- so, that makes two of us.

the second reaction that I had was one of comparison to others in probably body shape, appearance, etc. cause it felt quite a bit like "not good enough"

---

if that setup were to go through, I think what would happen is that I would become the female, and she would be the ground: I would be allayandra+anatau and she would be vulcan.

you can probably see the problems with that right off.

so, what I'm trying to do is to figure out how to do the abuela, bruno, mirabel setup. it would be just as it sounds, and I would be bouncing between a lot of confused perspectives of "not good enough", essentially puting all of the responsibility on me, and I'm sorta like bruno in that I'd rather just hide out behind the kitchen and let them create their own reaities. when it all falls apart, mirabel will finally seek me out (I suppose).

I suppose that another way to look at it is a two-way transmission where patricia is passing her implementation desires (she's vulcan the master craftsman now -- and this is in reference to constructing solutions to those voted desires) down to the girls to ultimately do a lot of the work, and I'm passing the girls perspective of "good enough" (hopefully) back up to her.

at the moment, it sounds kinda shakey to me.

---

there's a reaction, "wow, kenny even more candid" -- kinda a feeling of disbelief... lol yeah, I guess.. jaja

### 2022-04-04 18:07 - not-good-enoughness

I was laying there thinking about not-good-enoughness and I decided that I want to start getting into the habit of thinking out loud in here.

the first recognition was that tesla had a lot of not-good-enoughness going. he did kind of mention it in a few places in regards to why he hasn't married, but, in a lot of cases, he was so far ahead of so many people perceptually, it's difficult to relate to them.

I understand this quite well, as I find my perspective to be so different, I often saw myself as ahead or something like that (not really superior -- just they didn't really match my quality standards). this changed a lot when I got to spain as I had to actually hire and interact with people (alcohol helps a lot too).

for most of the time I was in spain, I would compare myself to other dudes who were "picking up chicks" and notice how not-good-enough they were -- and really, most of the guys out there are complete boneheads.

but, like I said -- it's counter-intuitive, but if I'm out there pointing the finger at all these other guys and saying, "wow he's definitiely not good enough for her" -- the thing is I'm only noticing my own not-good-enoughness in other people.

what I'm saying is that "quality standards" were actually inhibiting me -- and I know this to be true because as I stopped noticing how not-good-enough other people were, the more people started to think I was good enough.

when I stopped noticing how not-good-enough all people are, I also stopped noticing my own not-good-enoughness. I never said, "I'm not good enough for her (or whatever)" cause I'm too proud for that. instead, I would just notice how much better I am than they are.

so, what I'm saying is I stopped noticing how much better I am to other people -- meaning, I no longer felt the need to compare myself to other people to feel good about myself.

---

in summary, my own not-good-enoughness came about because I was watching a lot of people in the discos, bars and such and noticing a lot of really not-good-enoughness in other people. that lead me to live a life of comparisons and, I bolstered my self-esteem by comparing myself to and noticing those others that never could measure up using my quality standards.

as I stopped caring about others not-good-enoughness, they just became other people and I stopped caring about how well they measured up to my quality standards. just the same as in "effortless power", the process of stripping the gun of all of it's physicality, leaving just an inert concept behind -- people just became concepts of their own creation which interact with each other in predictable ways (ie what they're attracting)... and who cares what they're doing anyway.

so, by stripping all of these concepts of their physicality[^1], they became pure illuminated orbs of brilliancy to me. just like when meditating, you stop thinking (physical) thoughts -- well, this is the conceptual version of that. take the physicality away from the concept so that it can be perceived, no matter the circumstances for its brilliancy underneith all of that physical crap on the exterior. as you do this for others, you do this for yourself and you, yourself become brilliant and radiant like a star.

---

this process of removing the physicality from the concept is kind of the antithesis to romance (latin, spanish, etc.) interactions. the reason why all of these songs and movies, telenovelas, etc. emit such a powerful emotion is because they have in them so much physicality wrapped up in the interactions. for example, in encanto, if the abuela hadn't have got so angry with mirabel for ruining the miracle, the movie wouldn't have been nearly as emotionally impactful. though, it's just a normal response when someone feels responsible for something falling apart and they feel helpless to save it.

I try to understand these interactions so that I don't have a strong emotional reaction to them anymore. I learned that a strong emotional reactions create tremendous friction which are usually a waste of energy, but if one knows how to manipulate the concept perceptually, one can take all of that strong negative emotion and turn it into pure euphoria. I attempt to do this, and I even write (on purpose) reaction pieces, because I know that wanted-and-unwanted-are-same. I plow forward heading straight for disaster knowing that it's all a perceived disaster from one angle and from another it's wanted. so why not, like the latin romance crap (novelas, shows, etc.) pump up the not-good-enoughness?

small confession: do a brief look back and notice how much the not-good-enoughness angle has come up; it's quite significant, and I would venture a guess that most of the people following this *also* resonate with not-good-enoughness. I used to really have this *a lot*, and it's only been somewhat recently when I've gotten really serious about stripping the concept from its physicality.

I've never worried too much about all of the reactions to not-good-enoughness though because it's all perceptual and that mainly means that my auience mostly has high quality standards as well. there's nothing wrong with high quality standards -- it's just when they're put in comparison. a desire isn't a comparison. a desire is a desire, and my desire doesn't need to involve anyone else. it's just something that will happen naturally when my reality reflects it.

that means that the quality standards are just a distraction from what's really important which is my perception. as an example, try to sustain a feeling of bliss without meditating. if you can, then that means that you aren't thinking any thoughts in opposition to that bliss. the bliss is always there -- just the other crap makes the bliss hard to feel. likewise, the high quality stuff is always there, just the idea that you want to stay away from the low quality stuff keeps the low quality stuff in view.

look at it in the negative now: we're programmed (mostly by the television -- hello cnn/fox news, aida, muchachada nui, etc.) how to react to things, and we just repeat the reactions like the actors do. is that really how you want to react, or would you rather understand what attracted the interaction and therefore the reaction?

the reaction is the objective, for both hollywood and for LOA. if you want to react a certain way because you like how it feels, then you're seeking (attracting) the action to give you the reaction.

I used to try and explain to people in the bars that the television (most notably the news) is just a reaction programming service. I don't remember when exactly I gave up (probably in augusto's bar), but by the time trump got into office I had completely given up on trying to explain this concept, deciding to instead pick my reaction type. so, starting with colbert and meyers I decided to just laugh at it all. people reacted to me laughing at trump, which at that time, most people in spain thought that spelled the end of USA being taken seriously. they were kinda right, and they hated me laughing so hard at it all falling apart (which is probably also a programmed reaction).

anyway, the programming is everywhere and once you strip away the physicality from the concept, not only do you get effortless power and very fast manifestations, but you notice that the entire planet is just a bunch of barely conscious automatons reacting the way they're taught to react.

for example (song I'm listening to):

> do you want to stay? can't erase the pain; stay away ... stay away

lol

---

last thing, notice how I felt dissatisfaction to commit on such a profound note (about stripping away the physical from the concept to allow the brilliance to be seen)? well, it was too profound, so I returned back to write that reaction piece at the end. I just can't help it. it's what people want. they like to react to things. I've tried to hold profound conversations for extended periods of time and people can't handle it. I have to throw in some "shock jock" stuff to keep people distracted from what I'm really saying. I talk mostly for my own sake, so it's fun when I can get an audience and hold their attention for a while (for reals, sometimes I really have strong 2nd ray qualities)

very last thing: I'm noticing that this blog is going in the direction of being even more hyperbolic than the previous ones. I'm going to write almost anything that comes to mind -- so, the extremes will be far more: more profund *AND* more reactionary.

I think it's fun so don't take it too seriously :)

### 2022-04-06 21:52 - not sure (rename)

the last few days I've been going over that one idea with patricia that I put a few entries back. some hours(?) after I wrote it, I had the idea, "I should just send her an email" (cause I know her email by memory). every time I thought about it, I got a pretty negative reaction from mr. motor on it, and then today because I kept thinking about it, his reaction got even more detailed. it feels like she has some high level security clearance, and I'm kinda like the opposite of security -- so it creates a bit of a problem.

---

yesterday, the plan I was concocting in my head -- and it's hard to say where exactly the idea was coming from but I went with it anyway -- was to just email her and say something simple, then if she wanted to reply to me that's cool. then, if we should meet, I suppose I didn't really know what would happen -- but, as I mentioned in a previous entry, I'm sticking to the derek plan, so I would just hang out with her and stuff. I imagined that we could talk about quite a lot of things -- though, I'm not so sure about that now. I'm fairly certain that I'll do most of the talking and she probably wouldn't be able to say a whole lot -- sorta like how it was when I was with chris in LA.

in combination with other things like that dream I had with nassim, I would imagine that through some way or another, I'll make it out to california -- and like I don't know how necessary it is to be in a single location for her either so it's possible she may end up there as well. I clearly don't know...

anyway, the "vision" (it's not visual) sequence played out something like going to california and working with derek and nassim, and probably a few others on ... stuff, I suppose.

there was another element to it which a long time ago I said that if anyone wanted some sort of performance out of me, then I simply had to practise for it because there's no way that I'm ever good at anything the first few many tries. so then, in california, I would practise with the other girls for a while, and then later on, maybe it could be her birthday or something, eventually, I'll be ready to go with patricia.

there were other elements to the sequence but I simply can't remember them now. those are the essential parts though.

yesterday, I wrote [a bunch of crazy ideas down](/random-notes/1024y-offset) and then went to bed. I can only imagine how my thoughts on time slicing, the paper's acknowledgement that there are *gravity anomalies* around the planet and an erratic polar position (ie. precession isn't happening as expected). I chalk all of these things up as support for my hair-brained idea that we're 1000/1024y earlier in time than we thought -- but for someone involved in that stuff you can imagine how paradigm shattering it is to have *gravity anomalies*. this is a pretty big problem and it looks like the top guys in the US military know and are likely covering up a lot of "unexpected" and "baffling" results.

almost certainly this really did a lot to strengthen their fears of me interacting with someone with security clearance... I say that because I woke up this afternoon thinking about how I think that whole vision sequence is a really great idea, but I think I'd rather just go for ultimate disaster. let me see if I can explain it.

to understand this next part, I have to involve the conversation I had this morning with mom and jaron about my thoughts on genetic engineering, hybridisation, and the "origin of species"... I'll reexplain the idea and reiterate parts that had reactions to it. 

---

after exploring the document ["et guide to creation" by kuthumi](/sirian-guide/orig/docs/840515pc.htm) of which [I wrote many notes](/sirian-guide/et-view-of-creation.md), I came to the conclusion that that version of reality might have, and possibly did, happen. however, I believe that would have been a very long time ago iteration to it. the way that creation is told has inspired in me the fallen-angels being the catalyst to creation. the basic idea is that I (I'll say it from first-person) take my entire personality and I essentially separate it into two distinct parts.. the wanted (desirable) parts about myself and the unwanted (undesirable) parts about myself. I then take my present genetics and build suitable bodies for the "gods" from those genetics -- however, I animate the "gods" with concepts with all of the unwanted aspects about myself and a number of others that I don't like... I think it would be actually quite the challenge to balance good genetics with destructive concepts and not make a disaster. these are the jefes.

the story is well-planned in the sense that the jefes will attract worstening conditons for their planet and will have to exert constant effort to keep the whole thing from falling apart. they don't want to work though, because they'd rather utilise inferior beings to do their jobs for them, so they first try and get the citizens of that planet (just normal gods, not the jefes) to do the work, but they don't want to do it, so now the technical ones will design a subordinate race. they look to the planet nearby and use the ingredients left on the planet to create the "subordinate" race of beings.

various catastrophes are attracted by the jefes own attraction, and they destroy their own world and end up having to move to the other planet (earth) where they are locked into a reincarnation cycle with only entites on the earth.

that's the et-view-of-creation in a nutshell -- and it probably happened something like that. my idea picks up from basically this point because now we have earth filled with humans which have a flexible genetic code that is responsive to their thoughts and feelings, meaning that further improvements to the genetics can be done physically, but most are done mentally and perceptually. given that capacity, we're now capable of creating any biological form which is a reflection of the person's perception -- and I think that's exactly what I did.

I postulate that I went back, probably even further back than to pre-atlantian times (to make a civilisation conceptually compatible with the fallen-angels I'll introduce into the story). that complicates the story a bit, so let's just start from the hight of atlantis and assume that the reason why the "laws" were put into place like how they were was to create an environment of wanting to do things their own way (even rai ernon looks to be in on it), and then essentially force people to do the wanted aspect, so they rebel against the wanted aspect. introduce some fallen-angels, which, considering my ideas on box-consciousness are artificially maintained entities with a strong desire to control the world and influence it from the top down.

the whole plan is to allow this hatred for the wanted aspect to be founded on a lot of bad ideas (like laws requiring one to honour, and respect all of these poorly defined concepts with no real substance to them -- just a lot of good sounding words -- "religiosity"). as an example, listen to this crap (from "unveiled mysteries" chapter 2, the king is explaining why atlantis will crash and burn):

    "Only mankind is guilty of making a discord in the music of the spheres, for all else lives and acts in accordance with the—'Law of Love, of Life, of Harmony, and of Light.' All else blends into the harmonious whole—the 'Body of the Infinite, All-Loving One.'

    "All other realms of—'Life and Light'—move and create according to the fundamental principle upon which all Perfection rests. That principle is Love. If it were not for the—'Great Selfless Ones'—like your ruler—the Great Host of Ascended Masters—whose very keynote of existence is Love—humanity would long ago have destroyed itself and the very planet upon which it exists.

    "The transcendent and magnificent activities of Love and Light are the Natural Conditions in which God created and expected His human children to manifest—obeying His command—'to Love.' There is no such thing as a supernatural condition anywhere in the universe. All that is Transcendent, Beautiful and Perfect is Natural and according to the 'Law of Love.' Anything other than that is sub-natural. The daily experience of the Host of Ascended Masters is—the Perfection—God's children were meant to live in always. Earth's children did express this Perfection once—in a former cycle, which was—'One Golden Age.'

all these awful conditions are your fault because you're not like the selfless ascended masters who are obeying God's command to love...

    "O Children of Earth, I bring you a warning of serious import, at a time of great crisis. Arouse yourselves from the snare of the senses that is engulfing you! Awake from your lethargy, before it is too late! This, my 'Brother of Light' must withdraw and leave you to the experience that you have chosen, and which is slowly enticing you into its many pitfalls. You have opened yourselves to the uncontrolled ignorance and emotions of the outer self.

    "You give little attention and still less adoration to your 'Source'—the Supreme, the Mighty, the Radiant, the Majestic, the Infinite Cause of all that is—the Creator and Sustainer of all worlds. You give no gratitude to the 'Great Glorious Presence'—the 'Lord of Love'—for the very Life by which you exist.

    "Oh! why are you not even grateful, for the blessings Nature pours out so lavishly, for the abundance that comes to you through this fair land, and from your own wise and unselfish ruler? You thank each other for favors—the things of the senses and form that are so ephemeral—that pass from one to another and then are no more—but why, Oh why! do you forget the—'Source'—of all Life, all Love, all Intelligence, all Power?

    "People! O People! where is your gratitude to Life for Love, for the magnificence of experience that you enjoy every moment, every hour, every day, year after year? All this you call your own, but it has always belonged, does now, and always will belong to the—One Great Source of Life, Light, Love and All Good—GOD—the Supreme—the Adorable—the All-Pervading One.

it goes on for a little while longer then offers no actual tangible content about how to have adoration for your source. I find its ideas to have very little relevance to the listener. this section tells us we need "love" to bring harmony. I can see that "love" here is 2nd ray, "the—Great God Flame" is desire (1) and mind, form, action, etc. are the 3rd ray...

    "Love is not an activity of the mind, but is the—'Pure and Luminous Essence'—which creates mind. This—Essence—from the—Great God Flame—streams into substance, and constantly pours itself out, as Perfection in form and action. Love is Perfection manifest. It can only express peace, joy, and an outpouring of those feelings to all creation—unconditionally. It asks—nothing—for Itself because It is—Eternally Self-Creating—being the Heartbeat—of the 'Supreme.' Love owns—All—and is only concerned with setting the Plan of Perfection into action in all. Thus, It is a constant pouring out of Itself. It takes no cognizance of what has been given in the past, but receives Its joy and maintains Its balance by the continual—Out-streaming of Itself. Because this Perfection is within Love—forever flowing forth—it is incapable of recording anything but Itself.

    "'Love' alone is the basis of harmony and the right use of all Life energy. In human experience, this grows into a desire to give, and give, and give of all the individual's peace and harmony unto the rest of creation.

    "People! O People! forever throughout the ages! only enough Love can bring you back to the Heaven you once knew and abided in. Here, you will once again embrace the fulness of the 'Great Light' that gives all through Love.

so, because nobody has "love" prepare for punishment for not having "love"...

    "A visiting prince approaches your borders. He will enter this city—seeking the daughter of your king. You will come under the rule of this prince but the recognition of your mistake will be futile. Nothing can avail, for the royal family will be drawn into the protection and care of those—whose power and authority are of God—and against whom—no human desire can ever prevail. These are the Great Ascended Masters of Light—from the Golden Etheric City—over this land. Here your ruler and his beloved children will abide for a cycle of time." Turning to the king he addressed him, saying:

    "I bless you my noble, patient Brother! Loving and selfless has been the service to your people. Deep and eternal is your devotion to the Supreme One—the Source of All Creation. The Golden Etheric City awaits and joyously welcomes you and your children.

    "Within Its radiance you shall live serving through the Rays of Light which are forever streaming out from those who dwell therein, until these your people shall redeem themselves by—obedience—to the 'Law of Love.'

    "This 'Empire of Light' exists over the land you have loved so well. It is composed of self-luminous, etheric substance and rests above the physical city which is your capital. It is Real, very Real and much more permanent than any earthly city, for—'Light'—is indestructible and the Golden City is made of—'Light.' Into It, no inharmonious thought or disturbing condition of any kind can ever enter.

    "I will return in seven days to take you and your children into the—'City of Light'—where we shall watch the progress of humanity, and draw into the—'Light'—all who will discipline and make themselves ready. Encircling the City is—an invincible belt of electronic force—through which it is impossible for anything uninvited to pass."

my goodness, while reading this, I really wonder what are the tangible conceptual things that can be gleaned from all of that. for me, there's no actual information there. instead, it's a bunch of out of reach ideals, judgment, commands, authority which talks to people like they're stupid. it's that kind of crap that is an obvious mechanism designed to make people hate all of that spirituality stuff -- and, sure enough -- the destruction of atlantis did happen just like prophesied, causing some people to try and preserve the atlantian traditions in effort to hold on to the wanted aspect -- while others not wanting to obey the command to love went the opposite direction, attempting to install dominance power structures with all of the unwanted aspects.

I think it was all planned and designed from the beginning and the evidence is that it's commanded to love and for disobedience to that command they're told a prophecy (which they believe and then create) their own distruction. from the creator of the species's perspective, the first phase is to make the wanted aspects manditory, then for the ones that inevitably rebel against those commands, they are given the equally as bad admonishment to install all of the power structures of their own and enforce all of the unwanted aspects instead. then, from there it basically follows the phases described in leapfrogging-time-pickles, and then the creators use that society to push the difficulty level for theirselves to the maximum.

from my perspective, I think it could be possible to create this whole thing with a team, but consider the idea that "I" am designing a "species" (and I use that word in plato's conceptual/ideal sense rather than the modern sense), in which I would enjoy to inhabit the species.

I take myself and I split the concept of myself into 4 shapes:
- wanted
- unwanted
- unwanted (reverse polarity)
- wanted (reverse polarity)

and then I use these four concepts to create archtypes and transformations for the species, and then I jump into the species and become it. I definitely don't want to try and micromanage the thing from the top, as that's the unwanted aspect.

the whole system is based on the ideas of "law of attraction" in that I'm only really fighting myself. so, you may say, well, what about me? am I also fighting myself? yes, because you can only experience what you resonate with. so imagine for a moment only the physical aspect to it -- like a hybrid. here you have 4 different "species" that you're going to make hybrids of, and let's say that the reason for this hybridisation is because some environmental condition has changed making it difficult for the secies to live. consider the unwanted ones to be kind of like weeds in that they're more hardy cause they're more used to surviving under difficult conditions, so you have to find a way to mix these to breed out the unwanted aspects and maintain the wanted aspects.

I put the four concepts in that way because "unwanted (reverse polarity)" looks kinda like wanted, however in a sexual reproduction context, it's more like "unwanted (opposite sex)". so, now we have our groups:

- wanted (male)
- unwanted (male)
- unwanted (female)
- wanted (female)

you'll notice that the mythologies are full of unwanted males and unwanted females. in fact, vulcan is said to have created for zeus exactly that -- an unwanted female (pandora). soloman has the paiman concept/demon, etc.

it appears to me that hybrids of these concepts have been present all over the place, so it's no special thing for me to see creation happening as a result of mixing of these concepts.

---

so, it's my estimation that this whole setup has been created artificially as a concept of my own mind. the way I have it planned is that over the next era (1024y), humankind will go through rapid increase in capacity, and there will be quite a lot of us alive at the end of that time. I'm pretty sure the guys running the show are unwanted concept variations of my own creation, and essentially reflect all of the things that I'd rather not be a part of myself.

at the end of that time, many of us will be alive and we'll gain the capacity to go back and alter our own timeline in the format described in leapfrogging-time-pickles, and we'll iterate on this timeline for a while. I can't say how many iterations will happen as I don't think there's a limit. everyone makes their own reality, so I imagine that quite a few will go back and design their own "fall".

---

wow, I went a little longer on responding to some of the reactions than I imagined -- no worries. I woke up this afternoon and had a realisation that the vision sequence that I had was the *wanted* aspect, and if I'm true to my own concept, I should actually just not worry about it because the wanted aspect will happen -- though perhaps not in that exact way.

I think it's fine to keep trying to delay.

the other thing I'd like to mention is that leapfrogging-time-pickles doesn't necessarily imply a linear progression through the timeline. as an example, in the future, I'll likely jump back into this timeline with a whole lot of others, which means that my future self is probably alive today.

in fact, the other day (03-24), I had such an experience. it happened a few times but I had these very real seeming experiences (memories?) with amber (jp's wife), and it was as if I was the kid. I don't know what to think about it, but I remember when jaron read me jp's facebook post about him going to have a boy and I said something really weird like "I'm sure jp is going to be a very good father" -- which caught me as really weird because I don't usually say things like that -- ever. I don't really know what to make of it. there was also another instance (@[noseblog](2021-07-28 16:49)) where I was writing about how I was as a kid in relation to jaxson (whom I called "ted") and he represented for me the future of children -- I remember when I was writing about how I used to cry because of the way mom felt, I had a strong sensation that what I was saying was meaningful to amber, so I wrote "sorry amber?" right there to acknowledge that. I do have a lot of strange reactions to a lot of things, so I don't really discount the experience -- rather that I don't fully understand it.

I realise that the above paragraph could be taken to mean that I think future me reincarnated into jp's kid -- which upon reflection does kind of give that impression. I mean you'll have to ask her about her ideas on that, but I wrote that originally because I had another weird experience before that (I think I was out on the field) when I had this strong sensation that amber's kid would be a girl and the idea felt good to me. the same thing happened with jessica's kid too, but it turns out that both were revealed to be boys.

I supposed that the reason for this was that those children being girls was considered undesirable, and so then an alteration to the timeline was made where someone (dunno who) went back and changed the event on the timeline so that an x3 that looked like jp or like andrew had sex instead to ensure that the output was a boy (an x3), and so therefore they would be the first non-secret examples of x3 children on the planet.

I also wrote this to give the idea that once we get to the "end of days", then we just start over, and jump into new bodies. this is going to sound weird, but it feels like many from the future have been and continue to join me in the body I have now. I personally don't mind or care, really.

also, I'm pretty sure that many others are making their own timeline the way they want to do it as well. that's totally the point of it all, as I'm sure that each iteration they'll get bigger and bigger ideas of what to create. just imagine tens to hundreds of iterations from now, how the entire "species" will all be super awesome.

the key to all of this is that unwanted also creates wanted.

---

so, in conclusion, I'll probably just let it keep going. one of the key things that I was thinking about in that vision was the idea of the birthday. you see, in "encanto", I found patricia similar to dolores in that she hears everything. it also felt this afternoon when I was thinking about the birthday bit of the connection to the name dolores (many pains), because it may have happened that she suffered "many pains" in self-flagellation and that in some ways, that could "make it up" or something like that (not exactly that feeling), to kind of undo the previous suffering. I mean I don't think that she went through *that* much suffering -- but it was an idea on my mind so it's worth noticing, even if it later doesn't amount to anything.

I said all of that because I wanted to remove the time constraint. the other idea that popped into my mind is that I have this suspicion that some sort of changes place when girls interact with me. I don't have data to say for sure what kind of changes a girl goes through when sexually interacting with a guy, but I had this weird image of transfiguration appear in my mind -- OK, so lemme back up. the original concept was the idea that *if* I were made king, I would pass it on to someone else, preferrably a girl. well, I'm not a king, and know of no efforts to make me one -- nor do I have the requisite security clearance to be a king, either -- so for me it was a hypothetical situation.

anyway that image of "transfiguration" was the opposite: patricia transfigured, and it felt as if it were because of the discomfort (described previously as "many pains") being realised in the opposite direction of perspective -- and that caused her to glow and levitate and become radiant and beautiful.

the idea that this should happen on her birthday was that she'll be turning 37, so she'll have completed her 36th year. well, vere writes about the number 36 in job 41. [I made some notes](/random-notes/job-41.md), and she, like the leviathan will be the king of the proud children and has the number 36, which I estimate is also the same as the 666 triangle number which is the sum 1...36.

anyway that sounds a bit like trying too hard to me, so why not just let that whole thing fall through and just let all of the normal LOA stuff work out something better than that?

I really had a strong sense that timeline was already created, and that's actually how we got to this one. this one is even "worse" than this one -- a disaster of much more epic proportions. it's hard to explain the feeling, but the basic sense is that I felt very at ease to everything. so, for example -- if the whole stress to try and get me entangled with a bunch of girls to ensure that I don't go around in a connected state feels to be a large fear, and that fear was gone. I don't know what it was that made that no longer a fear, but it didn't exist. also the fear that I had to constantly be weary of my computer and these documents also seemed to disappear too. it felt like I was on an unavoidable course toward wanted and couldn't really miss it if I tried, and so therefore there's nothing to worry about.

there are a number of reactions right now to the contrary with even bigger fears, but I just don't think it's a problem. I think it's fine to just keep going, actually. we'll see how things go.

anyway, I'm really enjoying this process of learning and writing more. I can imagine a potential situation where I keep discovering more and more than I am now, and it becomes undesirable to let me continue to write -- as in, they need me doing other things. gravity anomalies... lol

### 2022-04-07 09:57 - why do I like writing here so much

I wanted to write a serious subject again so I wrote @[newblog](2022-04-07 09:21), so that's the context for this one. I was talking about how I like community I guess, but at the same time I realised that I think one of the main reasons why I have been playing around with the patricia idea is because I *don't* like the idea of a large community. I've always shyed away from people as it's a bit intense for me. I like large groups in music festivals or when I'm on drugs (sometimes), but mainly music helps a lot because it gives my brain something to focus on. I really enjoy singular focus, and I don't really like my attention being spread so widely.

I've mentioned it before but one of the the reasons why I dislike celebrations and parties and stuff (where I'm the centre of attention) is because I don't feel like I can think. I really enjoy small groups much more than big events. I don't ever really remember too many events where I've been on a stage with a lot of people looking at me, but the few times that I've been in the centre of attention it feels like my heart is going to explode from beating too fast. I don't suppose that it bothers me that people are looking at me, cause that doesn't matter.

I think it's the expectations that make my heart feel like it's going to explode. I like being in my own world so much that I don't really let people in to my world (as ironic as that sounds). in fact, if I go upstairs to try and talk about this subject with jaron (and he's pretty easy to talk to), it wouldn't feel very good at all, largely because of his perception of me -- which isn't bad, but it's that intensity of being too agreeable or a know it all that I mentioned.

here, sure I can feel people's reactions to what I'm writing but I don't really care that much because I don't have to see them or talk to them. I just write and let the stacks of assumptions build up till a completely unwanted reality eventually manifests itself for me.

I know that a lot of people want me to come out and start interacting with others, but honestly the idea of trying to figure science stuff or talking about my ideas is what I want to do. like, for example there are so many questions that I want to ask patricia about statistics of the human race. it's really hard for me to just keep making stacks of assumptions without any data. by nature, I'm very data-oriented and I find the building of stacks of assumptions to be a very risky process. in my own life stacks of assumptions have lead to complete disaster -- but I'm sorta hooked on writing in this way.

---

now, I'm going to contradict myself: the other reason why I don't like the idea of community and prefer to write here is because when I'm talking to people there are all sorts of taboos that I don't have to worry about. if I were to talk to patricia about statistics and stuff, almost certainly the data will either be a fabrication (to obfuscate the real numbers) in which case I'll feel discord, or it'll be a subject where she doesn't want to talk about it.

there's another problem with it too because I can negatively affect her. for example, I quizzed raquel all the time about her past boyfriends, not because I was jealous but because I was genuinely interested in trying to figure out how she processed reality. problem is, by asking her those questions, I caused her to focus on relationships that didn't work out. I tuned her to relationship problems, and then that's what we had. sure now, I'm quite a bit more adept at navigating around other people's tuning so even if she tunes to some unwanted aspect, I don't think it would affect me too much. it may affect her and also the audience though -- thankfully though, they already discourage people from encountering a lot of what I think and do. I'm likely to be a bigger problem for others now, rather than myself.

on the subject of snake-bros, I'm pretty certain that if I were to join their discord, it would create a lot of discord, as I would be wide open about a lot of subjects, not waiting the various hours for my desire to send the email to vanish before ultimately deciding not to do it.

I really think that for a lot of reasons, community is a terrible idea for me. instead, what'll likely happen is I'll wait this stack of assumptions grows to such a size that reality manifests and then pull out all the taboo subjects (just like I'm doing here).

the way that I talk here is the way that I'll talk to people in real-life, cause it's kinda training me to think and reason like this -- and also, it'll be attracted because it's what people expect.

the contradiction? it was the part about how I really enjoy the idea of talking to patricia about a lot of statistics, but at the same time I know it'll cause so much discord that I either probably won't enjoy it or it'll be fake numbers, also not making me want to enjoy it. so as much as I want to, I kinda don't really want to.

I really like my own world.

---

there is a bit of irony to this stacks of assumptions though, because we've sorta been programmed that the more inertia something has, the more "real" it is. these ideas aren't any more real than the standard model; they're just my best model for how the universe works, and it feels like it's starting to become a reality. I wonder how much our stacks of assumptions, like a child's assumptions about their parent actually modify the "rules" the universe runs by. is this new blog working to program you all to believe my assumptions?

### 2022-04-07 16:14 - the real reason for the discord?

I was not going to sleep until after the heater repair guy had left, but I was so tired I decided to sleep anyway. he came and the experience was strange. he was working, making noise and stuff, but it wasn't that much more noise than mom emptying the dishwasher, so I can easily think while he's working. I wanted to think about the previous entries I wrote. he seemed to be highly aware of what I was thinking. I would just tune him out though and get back to thinking about this.

one cool thing that happened while he was around is that my brain started to think in a circular motion. I hadn't experienced that type of feeling of thought for a long time. it used to happen as a child, and thoughts would go around in my head kinda like a whirlwind -- can't remember which direction, but I know I've also experienced it rotating the opposite direction. I noticed that in spain I could also control this feeling with a similar feeling that would come in through my ears (and I could reverse the direction too).

anyway, I started to think and every time this circular motion began to happen, he reacted to it and then it would stop abruptly. I felt extreme confusion trying to think around him when that circular motion wasn't present.

he started up the fire in the heater and I noticed that the efforts to remove the circular motion weren't working, so he stopped the fire and then went upstairs to tell mom a very unplausible story about a resistor spreading to the rest of the circuit (lol).

anyway, he definitely wasn't a heater repair guy, and the heater was just a coverup to perform some sort of maintenance on my room.

---

the other weird thing that happened is that I was thinking about these things I wrote above and I got a reaction that felt like another reaction to some comments I made about iron man. he was waving his arms around wildly in the movie greg was watching and I thought it was silly, because that seemed like a tremendous amount of calories to move a cube around (or whatever it was) and I asked greg why he isn't just moving all of this stuff around with his mind.

iron man has to do all of those movements because they are symbols of him using some super high tech to create things. since it's just a symbol and hollywood doesn't make money on showing someone laying in their bed with their eyes closed[^1] so it was a reaction to the *symbol* of super technological capability. jaron showed me a meme on facebook that confirms this where it said, "mom asks me to fix something on her phone and she sees this" -- and it's a picture of stark holding a cube in his hand in a very affectionate way.

the reaction is in relationship to the symbol of techo-capability, but I still don't know what that has to do with the heater guy and circular thought (not A means B means C means A, but thought that travels in a circular motion around the brain).

---

I then went outside to finally start to think about my previous entry and the discord associated with it. I don't know that patricia is actually the source of the discord, but that it's likely that she lives in a bit of an illusion and if she were to talk to me, I would quickly feel the discord in some of the statistics -- meaning that she's being fed numbers which are not actually representative of what's really happening. like, think about it -- if she does a statistic on something, but you know the number is 4 times more, just multiply the statistics by 4, right? wrong! that's not how statistics work, lol -- but they probably think something ridiculous like that.

anyway, it's more likely that my presence would ignite a bit of discord in her, because my capability is to see through illusions.

so, it's not the illusion created for me they're trying to protect, but probably the illusion they've created for her, instead.

anyway, I have more thoughts soon... still haven't fully figured out the stark thing either. also, I'm beginning to contemplate the idea that it may be the same for the snake-bros as well. like what if I get in there and some illusion is obvious to me, but it isn't to them?

[1]: though they could -- just superimpose the mental image on the screen, obvious that it's a mental image because the eyes are closed)

### 2022-04-07 16:42 - excavating thoughts

btw, for anyone out there that wants to begin decoding their illusion, I *HIGHLY* recommend this process that I do. I simply make the desire to know the answer to something, then I take my mind away from it by going to sit in the sun or walking or whatever and usually when my mind is away from the question, I feel the answer start to come. instead of translating it into thought or words then, I capture the feeling, run inside and start writing. never fails. I always expand my perception of that idea and get more questions ... rinse and repeat. don't be scared to write something that feels personal or sensitive. that's actually the indicator that you're approaching something deep. happy excavating!

### 2022-04-07 23:55 - what type of community do I want?

I woke up this evening with a strong sense that my previous -- so, in the previous entry, I talked about how stacks of assumptions would just pile up bigger and bigger until a manifestation is no longer avoidable. I considered that manifestation to be largely unwanted because I like my own world so much. I talked about community and used the conversations around the SnakeFam(?) community in snake-bros #201 as the basis for that. the general conclusion that I had is that I like community, but I don't really want to be a part of a community because I like my own perspective so much.

later on in the day I mentioned @[blahblog](2022-04-07 16:42) is the way that I discover things, which is kind of opposite to the way the snake-pit does it where they utilise the wide array of knowledge that everyone in the discord has to discuss the topics they're trying to gain insight on. I don't want to say that talking to other people is a bad thing, because it totally isn't -- and I really enjoy bouncing ideas off of other people which is why I rope people into conversations all the time (and why I write here) -- so it has a lot of value for evaluating the hypothesis, but I don't think it has much value for discovering the underlying principle to a thing, which is what most scientific inquiry is about.

personally, I've found that discussion with other people before I've made the working hypothesis tends to be detrimental[^1] and so therefore I tend to do my discovery internally and then I subject those ideas to the physical world and then see how well they perform. the bad performers (ie. I'm "wrong") get culled and updated and start again.

the snake-pit I think would be a pretty valuable place to do that, but I'm not really having internet so that would mean I would have to chat on my phone which is really annoying. I looked at the idea of running a proxy server on my phone to share the 4G connection to my computer over wifi, but it takes a bit to setup and I'm sorta liking the non-internet still. like, if I get internet again, would I go back to watching youtube? prolly not. in fact, most of my time would actually be spent in the snake-pit, actually.

---

however, is the snake-pit where I want to tune myself to? I know there are a lot of unsolved mysteries and stuff which are all really interesting and stuff -- so, what kind of community *am I* looking for?

I think for me the most valuable thing for me as a kid was talking to chris, because we had really open discussions. I don't know if he had any secrets or not, but I remember being pretty open about everything -- like I think we even discussed our masturbation regularity without much embarrassment.

I honestly can't remember if it was chris or someone else cause for some reason my childhood memories are very foggy now, but it seems like I had a friend[^2] where I relayed to them everything and updated my progress. I also feel like there was another friend where I would tell them when I fell into sin (so during the church, probably woody, phil, daniel, or chris), and other stuff like that. all these memories are so foggy for some reason, and I don't know if I'm actually making stuff up there.

anyway, that would be like the template for me, and I was thinking that what I really want actually is someone that is sensitive to feeling (probably around my level or higher -- so probably a kid) and they can simply tell me, "you feel bad when you do/think that" -- and maybe if they are more adults, we can talk(? recognise? feel?) about what sort of things that that we're attracting based on the way we feel.

---

you see, for me, I live in a world that's composed almost entirely of feeling. this is probably difficult to tell from the outside looking in, because I interact with the physical world just like anyone else does, but for me, what's "real" is all of the interactions that are ever present in my experience. they have feeling, and sometimes I miss these feelings because I'm distracted by stuff -- hence the reason for me liking to be alone.

so really, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'd enjoy a sort of feeling-based community.

the nice thing about feelings is they exist outside of time and space. I know this because I will receive the reaction from the person, even though I know they're asleep and it's weird because I know that later they got the message because I'll get the second reaction later (it's a bit stronger and more tangible) when they wake up. I don't really know how feelings can travel forward or backward in time, but once I realised I'm broadcasted a lot of very strange reactions that I felt as a kid make a lot more sense if I consider that people are viewing and reacting to that past experience either now or sometime in the future.

so, what that means is that this community is sort of special in the sense that it can exist outside of time and space, and there's really no effort to join it -- just tune to it and I'll get your messages. I may not respond to them all because I have a lot going on all the time, but I do get them, and as desire increases, they'll float to the top.

I don't really know how to structure this idea, and I don't really know how to implement it either. everything I described already kinda exists, I believe, so it's more for me to begin to figure out how to interact with it better.

---

so, as usual, I'll probably take the path of least resistance, which is the motor-way and just keep pushing back the manifestation until the stack of assumptions (beliefs) grows to such a magnitude that manifestation is no longer avoidable. when that happens, it can't be stopped, and definitely nobody, not even me will be in control of it, because it's all attraction.

to describe this visually, imagine a pinball machine that shoots the ball up to the top of the pinball machine, and because of the tilt (attraction), the ball rolls down to the bottom and along the way it can be bumped around by the bumpers, but eventually the ball is *going* to end up in the hole at the bottom. to ensure this, you can imagine that as time continues, the ball (me) is being attracted even harder toward the hole, so it appears as if the machine is tilting more and more vertical all the time -- then gravity strengthening, etc. -- as in, the longer I wait the faster the intial hit will propel the ball, and then the longer time passes the harder of a time (the stronger impacts will be needed) it will be to keep the ball from going in the hole.

I figure, if I really try my best, I can probably keep this going for at least a year or two more. in that time, I'm going to start to begin to see how to organise the community so to make it easier to recognise when something feels bad and I can get a reaction to adjust trajectory more and more easily. it's big impacts that make manifestations, so the less impacts, the longer I can go.

[1]: the obvious irony here is that I have recently started to abort my ideas earlier in their development by writing them here. you will soon see that this document will have the highest turnover rate in that it'll contain the most revisions to the ideas presented here because in newblog, I used it to force an evolution of the concept because like a morphic field, when others put their mental attention to the concept, it morphs and changes, so when I go back to the concept, it's unrecognisable to me. now unrecognisable, I have to rediscover it and output it again. this all happens inatantly (or nearly so) in the conceptual world, so to you guys it looks like I'm just endlessly repeating myself. this blog will be far worse, and it's because I'm using that early abort to force an evolution of the concept

[2]: now that I think about it, it could have been an imaginary friend based on a real person I called "jenny". either way, I wrote to her in the same way I would have wanted to be able to talk to her in real life.

### 2022-04-08 19:10 - the prodigal SOLAR ANGEL

I was originally going to write title this entry "a new definition of saviour" in light of my discoveries last night about evolution-of-concept and evolution-of-species. I was contemplating the part I didn't really understand so well in the reproduction/division of a cell. the idea is that the structure or logic of an organism is rigidly defined. in my first attempts to explain this concept in the @[dtp/thoughts](intro), I called this the problematic (unchanging) cell/planet/human, which resists change. it is parasitic in nature and so relies on the resources of others for its own survival, but what happens if its host starts to produce too many resources -- like a complete overabundance -- much more than the parasite can utilise.

this parasite organism cannot allow for abundance, because it's own belief is that there is not enough resources and so therefore has to use someone else's resources to stay alive. however, if it has an abundance, then it no longer needs others resources to continue its existence. it's situation is a violation of its own concept.

so, in order to return back to being a parasite (because that's what it believes it is), it must destroy the overly productive parts of itself so that it must once again rely on others for its sustinance. the other option is to eject the abundant ones from its presence, and continue on "unchanging". it's in this ejection process that cells "divide".

---

so, that's the old version of division that I had, and the new one that I'm considering is largely the same, but there's no need for a parasite to cause a division. in the new way, a conceptual copy of itself extends out ... so, let's think like we're a star now. as a star, you have a concept of yourself, and all elements and things in the solar system resonate with that solar concept. the sirians call this the SOLAR ANGEL, and it's basically the solar DNA that we're all a part of. the sun sends out that concept in its purest form to incarnate out into the environment (get trapped into matter), and then if everything goes well, upon this concept's return back to the sun (see it extending out as far as a planet), it'll come back with such intensity, but at a slightly different frequency than the solar concept that it causes a division of the sun into two suns, each with a slightly different solar concept of itself.

so, now, I want to apply that idea to biology, but I can't really see things as extending out of the sun in the same way that I see a concept extending out of the sun, so I have to think of it a bit opposite.

at this point, the parasite must sabotage those extre

---

going back to the SOLAR ANGEL being extending out of the sun in its purest form to initiate a division process: the reason why I say purest form is can come about from physical processes (like jesus did), or they can come about conceptually (as I'm demonstrating).

everything resonates with the origin of its creation -- like I resonate with the sun, but I still resonate a lot more with human than I do with the sun. so the goal of any entity extending out from the sun, is to make its vibration most most like the sun. the more this entity vibrates similar to the sun, the more the sun wants this entity to "return home" (the prodigal sun). out in the world, this prodigal sun can either become less resonant with the sun or more resonant over time, which will ultimately determine their "death" (to evolve the concept to find a more suitable form capable of vibrating sympathetically with the sun) or if its similar enough in vibration to the sun, when it dies, it will return back to the sun causing the split.

anyone who figures out how to continue and resonate more and more like the sun, the sun will desire its return more and more. (remember, the sun is the "Father") so the longer the prodigal sun takes out in the world staying apart from the father, the stronger the attraction will be for the sun to come back "home" and create this solar split.

resonance with the sun can happen any number of ways (tantra, pranayama, meditation, etc) some more physical processes, and others through perceptual processes (like I've been saying). I did not start out very sympatetic with the sun, but over time I've become very attractive to the sun. the better I get at resonating like the sun does, the more the sun will desire my return. that is -- unless I get connected, and release my SOLAR ANGEL back to the sun.

obviously they do not want me to release my SOLAR ANGEL and "get connected" because that would be very bad for their situation. they believe they're a parasite, and so a connected person that has solar perception is definitely NOT WANTED for them. as a result, they have to ensure that I don't release my SOLAR ANGEL, which basically means the problem will continue to intensify until finally I'm allowed to release my SOLAR ANGEL.

this may be the origin of the idea of putting me on pluto, as out there I would be considerably more distant from the sun, and so therefore the attraction felt will be considerably less.

---

so, maybe instead of "going infinite" we could do a trial of only a 1024y or whatever. imagine next time -- they'll have to keep creating and moving me out to further and further out structures from the sun in order to preserve their precious house of cards. if they can continue to create further and further out structures, they can keep their fragile house of cards from falling apart and all of their secrets...

it's kind of a two-sided problem where they have to determine what's more important to them: if they don't allow me to get connected, they're essentially powering the sun up for a very large "nova" event eventually occur (which, as in evolution-of-species, this "death" happens to evolve the human (my) concept to produce future entities even more capable prodigal suns) -- or, they can allow me to get connected, and build here instead something reflective of my own perception.

it seems like the allowing me to get connected is the obvious answer, and I would agree, but it's kind of a big problem for them. it would calm the sun down a whole lot, but then they have another looming problem -- which is that I'm not the only prodigal sun; all of us are, and I think the leapfrogging-time-pickles setup is to iterate on this and to try and give them the best possible chance to keep everyone away from getting connected for as long as possible.

---

well, I didn't get to the topic I wanted to talk about which was the redefinition of saviour, lol.

### 2022-04-08 21:23 - perception and the fracal universe

it seems that once again I'm careless with the words that I use. I said that the "sun is the 'Father'" -- and by this I wan't trying to say that the sun is "God" -- but rather, I was saying it in the sense that it is the parent concept.

the solar system is a concept, the planet is a concept, the galaxy a concept, and the universe also is a concept. in we can imagine that in the centre of the "universe" we would find a very luminous object have a similar appearance to a star, yet more like sirius b than our sun -- likely emitting nothing in the visible spectrum, and only in very high frequencies (x-ray, gamma and upwards), being itself extrely dense.

so, looking at the sun as the "Father" is not that big of a deal because all things should reproduce after its own kind, so we should see all sorts of things which are similar to each other but at different scales (scale invariance), and so we should see the same pattern of reproduction repeating itself in similar ways, no matter how big or small we get.

the sun will be a reflection of "God" (or "source") and reproduce similarly, so this "prodigal sun" idea is, I believe the way that cells reproduce, as once a conceptual part of the cell passes some energetic threshold, it begins it's return back to its source (ie. prodigal sun), and in the process of return, the parent "Father" cell resists it's return, and the result is the creation of a new cell.

to put this into science words, imagine for a moment an extremely high energy proton being attracted to the sun. that proton is trapped in matter and the sun wants that proton so badly, that when it's finally released from matter, it goes toward the sun at a very high speed vibrating very intensely. it hits the sun, and vibrating like the sun, but not quite exactly like the sun, it's this high energy proton is attracting a body that is very similar to the sun (but not quite the same). it traverses the solar interior attracting the components for its new birth out the other side as a tiny sun. those can be thought of as CMEs.

once out in the solar atmosphere, still having a slightly different vibration than the sun but not quite the same, they will attract each other, but their difference will also cause them to repel eachother a bit (they need their own space, you know). the new one, just like every other new child will attract the physical components necessary for its continued growth.

---

now, if someone wants to call those spheres and that style of creation "God", that's fine with me, but I don't think it's any more "God" (or source) than the sun is. it seems that perhaps that style of creation is "God", or maybe all of creation is extended out of "God" in this manner.

so, because all of these things will extend out of it's parent ("Father") in a similar way, we should see all aspects of creation a pattern where something extends out of itself becomes a tangible (created) reflection of itself, things happen to it with others in the environment that it's in, then it "dies", only to return to its source and transform into a new and improved version of itself.

---

this style of creation is perceptual in that it can be "seen" as happening infinitely in bigger direction and infintely in the smaller direction. our collective perception of the "bigger" and the "smalller" from whatever vantage point we have is "the whole of creation" and it's a composite of all of our perception combined. so is "all of creation" itself, "God" -- or, is the concept of "all of creation", "God"?

I believe that everything is perceptual, so there are infinite layers above and below as far as one is capable of looking. in that sense, we are all universes of our own looking outward. from your perspective, because it's all perceptual, you are "God" and you are looking out into your creation.

to explain this idea, consider what you can see with your eyes. the distance that you can see is reflective of our capacity to peer outward. same with microscopes and particle colliders in that they give us a glimpse of the fractally smaller. now, when I look out at the world, the things that I see are a reflection of my own concept of myself. I can only really see things that I resonate with, so in the end, I am translating vibration into a reality which is a reflection of myself. I'm just seeing a reflection of myself outside of myself. likewise, if I look inwardly, I'm also only a reflection of my concept of myself, but inwardly. my concept of myself contains "God" and resonates with "God", because if I didn't I wouldn't be a part of "His" creation.

hopefully that clears it up... these topics are difficult to explain in text. in the end, it all comes from a deep knowing, cause that's good enough. you don't need to be able to explain the universe in words to be able to know that we are all "God's creation".

---

I put quotes around the word God because my point is not to alienate, but to show that all systems are all saying nearly the same thing, and so fill in "God" with whatever you want, and it'll work. it's impossible for something to be a theory of reality that doesn't contain these ideas in some way and that all creation "proclaims the glory of its creator" -- or reflects the creative principle of its creator.

even if someone were to try and deliberately remove God from these ideas, turning what I wrote into a purely mechanistic and material representation, it would still contain the creative principle. therefore, no matter how much corruption or different versions of "God" there could be, the "God essence" can always be found in the creative princple.

it's just as impossible to take "God" out of creation as it is to take the proton out of an atom and still have an atom. likewise, it's also just as impossible take light out of adam and still have adam.

### 2022-04-09 15:02 - starbucks again

I feel preetythe differemce btween walking here and not walking. I feel signicantly worse, as I think I really like the walk. next time I go to jonny's I'm pretty sure I will want to walk there simply for how much better it makes me feel.

I feel especially deaw today. something crazy happened last night and I haven't felt very good since... enough about that though. I've been trying to fell people too, and I have to say, I'm really out of practise or I am significantly more dull than usual. it's really weird because I look around and I don't knw what to think. that may be a reflection though as it's quite possiple that's what others are feeling when they look at me: "I dunno what to think about this guy."

---

ok, so in other news, when I was talking with jonny about good conditions and how some people are just giong to be miserable no matter what, I realised that I've released a lot of resistance. feels good I suppose. I think mainly, I had the contrast between the more common viewpoint that jonny conveyed to me, and my own from deep inside isolation -- like, it helped me to see that I just don't worry about stuff too much anymore.

I don't really know what else to talk about now, so I guess I'll end it here.

---

so I did think about that one thing I said about people looking at me, because when I walked into mcalisters, because I forgot what it was like to have people looking at me. sometimes I have a lot of sensation (a strong effect) when someone looks at me, and other times it feels difficult to concentrate.

I had an idea though from the heater guy -- cause if he can make my head spin, then what if, instead of others perception of me affecting me, I caused them to tune to me instead. when I look at someone, I tune to them, so what if I just reversed the polarities and caused them to tune to me? it's worth a shot. I'mm definitely begin to experiment with it.

it feels like all I have to do is to just do the same thing that I already can do with my heart but instead of inputting my energy, I input *their* energy... I realisee this will probably improve my posture as well, because it's harder to do slouched over (whick is normally how I sit).

needs more experimentation... I want to walk now...

---

oh, another thing... my thoughts are a lot quieter now. sometimes I would feel like I'm interacting with a person and things which may feel like questions or desire for a reaction, I would feel the response bubbling up, and then I would hear a reaction. sometimes this process would feel kind of obvious to me, but somewhere since the last time I went to B&N and now, this has changed quite a bit. I noticed that later on I could feel reactions from GMA but then when I went back to try and figure out what it was, the reaction bubbling was so insignificant that I wasn't even aware that I've reacted.

what I mean is, it seems that I'm reacting to people but I'm not even aware of it now.

### 2022-0-06 20:25 - thinking about latest stuff

I feel very strange after going to starbucks. I can't really figure out what the main reaction is. to some extent, it feels a bit like people are disappointed in me -- not all though, obviously. I'm not sure what it's all about really. I'll keep trying to figure out what it is, but perhaps it has to do with my idea that I can figure anything out...

I mean, anyone can. it's a documented thing with a considerable amount of evidence that remote viewing is a thing. channeling is also a thing, and both of them are tuning processes. I suppose the main difference is that I'm willing to try it out for myself and develop the skill. it's not like I'm expecting to get it all right or anything.

also, I have given a lot of thought to the idea of figuring things out -- and you all know that I'll see it the way I see things, which is obviously going to be different than how others see things. in fact, I don't really expect many people to get the way I see it. I've tried to explain my perspective throughout the years and never actually had any success at it. I disagree with a lot of people on a lot of different things, and it's because I see things differently. an obvious one is how jonny and I see the environment and the world. he thinks there's only one planet and we're not treating it well, and I believe that all reality is a reflection of my perception. if nosebook would let go, the entire planet would transform into a reflection of my perception, so everything would be radiant, vibrant, self-luminous and full of life. obviously that's not desirable for them. they lose control of everything if that were to happen, so they have to ensure that my reality is never created.

that's fine with me. I don't really mind because they can't actually hold it back forever, so I'm willing to play their game for as long as they can keep it up. if things go well, they'll figure out how the universe works, and have their final edition printed before I head out. it sounds great to me. I say let them try as hard as they want to. I'm not going to tell anyone what to do or say and all of my ideas are free, so I hope them the best.

the earth will be a reflection of the collective perception, and so if the theory of how the universe works (final edition) is based on destructive processes, their creation will reflect that. you can know them by their works/fruit, and their models will reflect their perception the same way. so, do you suppose they're modeling the improvement of the climate, or modeling the collapse of habitable living conditions? I suppose it's the latter, and so they're attempting to create that reality. if that's the reality they want, then I just don't see a problem, because that's *their* reality; mine will be different.

nobody is forcing any reality on anyone. people watch the news and say, "oh wow, everything on the news is reality" -- and that's fine if that's what you want your reality to be. some people are still optimistic thinking to theirselves, "you know, if I shout and protest loud enough, perhaps they'll decide to do something different" -- and to that I say: you can't expect a person to deviate from their perception of reality. if they think they need to manipulate things and fight over stuff to assert their dominance, then that's what they'll attempt to do -- so like, let them think that.

---

what I don't understand is why people spend so much time complaining about everything. just do it! don't wait for them to do that. as an example, there have been countless people waiting for these boneheads to create an open forum where people can discuss archeological ideas without having to maintain the mainstream narrative, and it exists now. imagine if kyle and russ just sat around waiting for the archeologists to make such a forum. it won't ever happen because their perception is about keeping information withheld. an open forum with free interchange of ideas can never ever ever ever exist in their form of perception, ever.

just start making all of the stuff that you want instead of waiting for these guys to fix stuff.

one of the things that I was explaining to jonny is that no quantity of good conditions will ever cause people to stop being miserable. so, let's just ignore the conditions of the planet at the moment and focus on social and emotional conditions instead of the physical. I guarantee 10000% (if that's possible) that if 1000 people in the same general area improve the way they feel by improving their perception, this will completely change the planet from top to bottom.

I'm one person and it's clear how much effect I have on the planet just when I feel good. the better I feel consistently, the more dramatic that effect is. I'm pretty certain that if 100 people (a very small amount) of people actually felt good (perceptually instead of conditionally) about to the same capacity that I had in 2018, the planet turning into a veritable paradise is completely unstoppable.

that's really not that hard to do. back then, I was in "it's all attraction", "perferring to feel good over being right" and "not needing the manifestation" (ie. not needing good conditons to feel good). those are all so simple to do and pretty easy to master. I've been talking about a lot of advanced topics because that's where *I'm* at, but maybe I'll consider the idea of perhaps trying to convey more of the simple ideas to jonny rather than the complicated ones[^1] next time I see him and hopefully that'll help. it's common that I get so far out into the discussion that I alienate people, and then they don't want to ask wth I'm talking about because they don't want to feel stupid, or something.

I have no idea what isn't obvious to others. I spend nearly all of my time thinking about these things so I've made a lot more realisations and jumped to a lot more conclusions (and been wrong about them also) more than most people. I really have a difficult time seeing things from other people's perspective, and so that's why I ask so many problematic questions.

it has been the most difficult thing for me all of my life to actually figure out what other people are actually thinking and feeling about what I'm saying, and I've developed a lot of my ESP capacities because I was so bad at even the basic stuff like reading body language and facial expressions (I've improved a lot, but I've found that most people's body language and facial expressions are not what they really feel, but they way they want to appear to feel, like actors or something).

so, I continue to try and develop my sensitivity further and further to actually be able to figure out how people are *really* reacting to what I'm saying. I honestly don't know what's not obvious to others[^1].

OK, rant done. maybe one day I'll be able to actually be able to accurately know what others are thinking and feeling about what I'm saying -- and, hopefully this illuminated at least a little bit why I like me and my world so much.

[1]: I realised in the discussion of alchemy that I'd totally lost him, so I switched over to talking about the news in a very simplistic way, just showing how it's all a pretty big con-game to make more money and even though they're terrible people, it's still not a good enough reason to feel bad about it.


### 2022-04-10 03:36 - the promethian dilemma and dream

I woke up just now from a dream where I was showing how the conceptual world works. I can't remember what all of the elements were now, but the main theme is that all things reflect the concept of their creation. it had something to do with sex as well, as that too will reflect the concept of the people involved mixed with environmental conditions and their present emotional state.

---

so, I was explaining that I could just have sex and it would reflect the concepts, but that's probably not very helpful because if anyone is going to figure it out, the elements are already there -- one just has to look at them and put the pieces together.

I just do stuff and in the end, the best sort of way that I can demonstrate it is with example. it's probably for this reason that I don't have (nor intend to have) all the super great conditions, and I worked my way out of many of my limiting perceptions by my own effort. like I was explaining to jonny, when someone is miserable, the last thing anyone wants, is "help". I neither want to tell anyone what or how to do things either.

the way I figure it'll happen is something like what I've said in the leapfrogging-time-pickles, where everyone is the salt and they'll iterate on theirselves in their own alchemical process. it's likely that control over their own alchemical process will be acquired in some way, and I think there are two main paths toward gaining temporal perception and talking control of one's alchemical journey: the using technology and using perception.

time is just the transformation of interactions between vibrations. in the beginning there were many less vibrations interacting so time was much slower. however, now there are many more vibrations interacting so it appears as if time is speeding up, but really it's just more interactions.

so, when time is just a sequence of interactions which are necessary to go from one vibration to another vibration, each of those interactions produce higher frequency harmonics from the interaction, so it's normal that the manifestation will always be more (wanted or unwanted) than what was originally imagined.

so, no matter how one gets from point A to point B is irrelevant, as all paths are equally valid. so, if the destination can always be reached, it then becomes a task of optimising for desired qualities of the path (ie. the intermediate opposite polarity transforming vibrations).

this whole selection process is really all a matter of preference. there's no wrong way and none of the intermediate vibrations are "wrong" or "bad".

well, once again, I didn't get to the subject I originally wanted to talk about...

### 2022-0-00 16:58 - obviousness

yesterday, I was contemplating the idea of there being an incompatibility in what I think is obvious and what others don't think is obvious. multiple times I've tried to explain the obvious bits in order to get to the point, but the problem is, I either forget the point (my problem), or I feel from the person that I'm reexplaining something that I already explained or is obvious.

I really have a hard time trying to figure out what is obvious to other people. as such, lately, I've tried to just get to the point anyway because the people actually listening are not actually normal people, but nosebook -- so, while I'm explaining the idea to mom (for example), it's nosebook that's listening, not mom. so, I just try to get to the point.

---

as an example, I've been wanting to call david back, but I feel resistance because I hate to constantly reexplain everything and I don't know what I can actually talk about. I want to just get to the point, but at the same time I want to explore new ideas too -- so I end up writing here instead of calling him.

this whole problem of what is obvious and what is not is solved in part by a community like the snake-pit. it's just assumed that you know what "skerptard" means, and that's fine. the reason why I've shyed away from that is because whenever you have your own lingo, you obviously alienate a lot of other people that aren't in the club. this is very corporate business in nature to make up terms and then look at you like a retard if you don't know (for example) what "actuator" means. everyone knows what actuator means -- it actuates -- duh.

so, inevitably, I'm forced to continually communicate in the lowest common denominator, which is (I think) the main problem youtubers face and why it's rare for videos to ever go really in-depth -- as, all videos have to be targetted to the lowest common denominator of viewership -- and if you want hits, you have to target the mainstream audience, which usually means nothing in-depth.

therefore, as a result, I'm totally fine with the fact that my largest most interested audience is nosebook -- simply for the fact that I don't have to just keep going back to reexplain the obvious parts. they probably try and figure out the obvious parts communicating with my psychic body while asleep.

my mention of the psychic body is too an assumption that you've been following dtp and my realisation that the psychic body contains memories in astral format and is programmed to be able to actuate in reality without any guidance. it's a purely reactionary body, and the sort of base programming for the "automaton" -- and it's this body that nosebook is interested in programming during dreams and other visual experiences, to try and guide one's default reactions to be the reaction practised in the dream (visual sequence). that body can also react to questions to reveal the obvious.

so, for me, I kind of enjoy that nosebook is my biggest audience and they feel the information that I relate to be good enough to want to try and keep out of reach of the peasants. in the end, they are the biggest believers in me. if I go out and try to explain this sort of stuff to others, I'm met with the normal backlash from the mainstream narrative -- as in, "how could CO2 be a good thing that charges the environment with a specific vibration?!" sort of thing[^1]. I don't have to explain all of that, and I want to continue to move forward with my expansion of understanding.

---

there's another subtopic going on here and that is that I want to continue to advance my understanding. abraham was always bewildering to me because they would answer the same questions over and over again. I figured out what they were saying (admittedly, it was harder to implement than understand), and desired to go to deeper topics. I found out that they were going to just keep iterating on the basics forever, and if I wanted to know more, I was going to have to figure it out myself.

there's a big jump between "you get what you think about" to how DNA and the evolution-of-species works. I worked my way up to figuring it out realising that the problem is the word "species" -- and that the modern scientific definition of the word doesn't encompass the conceptual nature of a "species", but tries to make the definition with physical attributes when there is considerable overlap, and hybridisation (the mixing of concepts) should be a regular occurance rather than the exception. inotherwords, my own perception of what a "species" is, was the limitation that I had to overcome to expand my understanding. abraham works on helping people to overcome those limitations, and leaves the discovery to us -- which is nice and it makes sense.

---

finally, the remaining barrier to effective communication I noticed was in questioning process I do inside of my head to know what's obvious.

when I was younger I learned of an idea called "testing the spirits" where you say something as if it's true, and then listen for the response to it. if it's not true, then it'll feel bad and if it is true, then it'll have a positive feel to it often motivating further inquiry.

that was very helpful for figuring a lot of things out and you see evidence that I still use the same technique, treating everything as if it were true. however, it's really terrible for conversations. if I notice something about someone, I say in my head, "this thing is true" -- like for example, yesteday, I noticed one of the starbucks barrista's earring and I wondered if it had significance. I later had reactions to this inquiry in my head, as I think it probably got taken the wrong way because the way I "test the spirits" is to say it in the positive manner, so it would have gotten translated perhaps as "that earring means this".

I've tried to do this less verbally in my head and just do this conceptually in my head because it's faster and I can go back to look at the answer later and don't have to be inundated with data. so, the fact that I got the reaction means that nosebook is trying to translate these concepts into physical form in effort to understand my interaction with the conceptual world.

that's the present problem, but in the past, all my efforts to try and figure out my conceptual relationship to another person in conversation has been badly translated or something, such that there are soo many misunderstandings, that it tends to make me want to *not* want to try and figure out my relationship to another person, as it causes problems.

this creates a huge problem (and another reason to prefer to stick to myself) because from my perspective, am I a consumer or a creator?

if I'm a consumer, I want to actually understand the content I'm consuming, and so therefore I want to make inquiries into every aspect of the content presented to get a fuller picture (where is the person coming from, what's the objective of the data, etc.). if I consume without any inquiry into what I'm consuming it's a bit of a waste of time, and that's why I haven't really been very excited to go back to youtube since not having internet.

if I'm a creator, I want to actually present the data in a way that the audience can hear it, and so in order to do so, I have to make inqueries into the person -- so, like I want to know if the person knows alchemy, I say, "this person knows alchemy" and then feel the resonance which then motivates the direction of the conversation. I try to do this in the positive because the negative is disastrous.

for example, if I want to know if a person doesn't know something, I say, "this person doesn't know anything about programming" and then feel the resonance (truthiness). in the positive case I get false-positives, because people want to pretend they know things they don't, and/or are unwilling to admit they don't know something. in the negative case, I usually get a negative response ("he thinks I don't know ...") -- and, sometimes I get negative-negative responses, which are hard to explain so the best I have is an example:

one time I was talking to remi and I felt like she would know what I was talking about so I used a spanish word to explain a concept, and she responded very negatively to that -- like, "how dare you speak spanish to me" (she probably does know spanish but doesn't want to get sucked into speaking spanish). so, I tend to try and not use spanish words to explain ideas since -- even though often times they are the way I relate to the concept.

all in all, the process of trying to figure out what is obvious to other people so that effective communication is possible a very treacherous process. I don't have any solutions, the obvious thing to do is to *not* try and figure out what is obvious to the other person and stick to my own point of view.

I figure a lot of feelings will get hurt and a lot of misunderstandings will happen but none of those are my problems. I don't really have any intention of trying to adhere to the lowest common denominator anymore. anyone listening has to make the effort to keep up[^2]. I want to continue to expand my understanding, not explain the same thing.

in the end, this is all about me and it's my own discovery process. I don't really have any obligation to try and present this in a way that's easy for others to understand -- and unfortunately, the way things have developed, it's been detrimental for me to try and find common ground of what is obvious.

[1]: this comes as a re-reaction to yesterday's comment about CO2 being used by shamans all over the world to change the vibration of the environment to be that of the shaman in order to increase likelyhood of a shared visual experience and increase likelyhood of a stable experience. when I was in spain before they removed the ability to smoke indoors, whenever in a public space with lots of smoke, there was a much stronger sense of the vibration (feel) of all of the people in that venue. it seems to be connected to smoke, because with dani, daniel, and alfon, we've all had experiences where in a smokey room we all seem to join in the same mental plane, sometimes sharing thoughts and visuals. CO2 seems to activate this, and it's plant food. CO2 seems to be sympathetic to its producer (human, fire, volcano, etc) and O2 seems to be charged by the sun.

[2]: so, like ask questions, I guess -- but that's not really a great solution because then I end up in a conversation like I had with buzzword-bingo spiritual guy at friendly harbor. I'm explaining and answering a lot of questions, but none of them are heard. again, another reason to just stick to myself.

### 2022-0-01 01:57 - disorder and depth

one of the things that I noticed about the previous conversation is how quickly it is to alienate people. it is true that I purposefully present a concept here to force an abortion and subsequent evolution-of-concept, so I do try (in some sense) to present ideas at a low comprehension level, but not for others' understanding but so that those low comprehension level ideas can go to die, allowing the bigger concept an easier time to emerge.

because I'm trying to get bigger concepts all of the time, by nature my concepts will alienate people because it's just impossible that others can follow it. I think that's the point, actually.

---

a few entries back, I talked about how if 100 people were like the 2018 version of me, that would have a much more dramatic effect on the environment than any amount of "green" products.

there were two main reactions, I think both from nosebook (different divisions though). the first was that 100 2018-me's would be disastrous (proving my point), and the other was 100 2018-me's would be pretty easy to keep under control, proving the point above that the whole objective of this is to alienate people.

it's fine that nosebook is my main audience because the whole point is for them to get it. they'll treat my answer as "the right answer" and then work their hardest to ensure that nobody ever comes to the same conclusions as me, to preserve the inevitably further disabled version of "science" that will be fourthcoming. I say disabled not in the sense of it being able to produce more iPhones, but in the sense that it'll probably obfuscate the night-side (time, attraction) by focusing mainly on space and repulsion/barriers. I think it'll neglect the conceptual nature entirely because they need people to believe in (and be scared of) death, eliminating the importance of the rebirthing process of the concept actually driving evolution of species and ideas.

it'll create a lot of products and be able to build really big things though, but investigating how things really work will be a big taboo (you don't need to do any experiments because we've already figured it out for you, and this is how it works -- or, if you do the experiment, your conclusion should be the same as ours, obviously).

this will work for quite a while, as nosebook is getting better and better at steering people and oppressing things that don't fit the narrative, but it won't work forever. eventually, it'll produce such a wide diversity of ideas that are all different than my "right answer".

that's the point, I think -- for me to come up with "the right way" so that nosebook can steer everyone away from it -- having a multitude of alternative ways instead of just one right way.

remember @[newblog](2022-01-11 18:43), and my thoughts on why having a single right way is kind of a bad idea? the directors of ideology will always tell you what "the right way" is, and for most, the "right way" is the path of least resistance because it's the wide path that many travel.

so, if you were enki and you realised that all efforts to communicate "the right way" (perceived by him at the time), are just going to be corrupted and turned into a giant money-making scheme, what then would you do?

I propose that because the-problem-is-the-solution, the solution *is* to just lean into the problem and go for the biggest money making, product-oriented approach to spirituality.

it's kind of a bit of a return to the mixing of science and religion, but in the negative form. on one side you have science and religion so deeply intertwined they are the same thing. then, you go a full 360(degrees) around the circle and you have nearly the same thing: science so divorced from religion that it is a religion.

obviously neither of these are desired, so how about any of the infinite other angles on that circle? what we want to do is to optimise for diversity rather than for one right way -- so you make sure the guys running the show ensure that nobody ever figures out "the right way".

> the natural order is disorder (song excerpt)

and so it makes me think about the symbol of earth (cross with circle around it), and this is the time to explore all of the angles that are *not* the four cardinal directions (the white instead of the red, blue instead of yellow, etc)

---

I wanted to talk about cliques and their relation to elitism and "the right way", but that'll wait I guess. sorry that my conclusions are increasingly becoming more and more chatic in nature rather than ordered, and so hopefully I illuminated the bigger picture a bit. at least for me, this entry was very enlightening. I have more thoughts on "enki and the right way" but they're not ready yet (and probably soon to be aborted.. lol)

### 2022-0-02 00:01 - random thinking about language, vocabulary, and elitism

I mentioned this in a previous entry and the reality is, I just don't have a solution to this. one side of me really wants more words to describe more specific concepts -- and it really is nice to have new words that are funny and pertinent -- however, I grew up in california, and during the 90's ever little clique of kids had their own vocabulary.

I also learned spanish with dani, and to my dismay, I found out that a lot of the words he used he must have made up. problem is I really liked those concepts and still use "parras" to this day, but when I used those words around other people they often looked at me like I had a mental difficulty or something.

it's kinda for this reason that I've come to the idea of going the german way and just sticking a bunch of words together to make a new thing. to foreigners it looks like a really long jumble of letters for a word, but for a native speaker, it seems to make sense. I try to make mine more clear so I use the (I dunno what to call it, but css property definition format of - separating), as when I used to use "LiveScript", I could hyphenate entire things together in a long variable name, and it would make sense. it was almost like writing english in a structured format. I'll demonstrate:

```
with evolution-of-concept do
  property something to another thing
end
```

and that would produce code that would take the properties of `evolutionOfConcept.property(something(to(another(thing))))`. the thing it didn't have is the ability to define syntax and expressions so it would force those things to be calls. this is why when later I converted to elixir, now I can specify using macros the order in which the calls are made by defining rhs/id/lhs expressions.

the idea was that I wanted to make essentially a programmable version of english where some keywords were syntax (do, end, for, while, if, etc), but could have custom behaviours attached to them, and then basic concepts could be created by simply stringing ideas together, and then any expression of speech could be looked up and parsed to find its meaning.

anyway, the idea was to find a way to structure english in such a way that it could be extended to fit any set of circumstances -- and as long as it could be meta-programmable and extended to fit the desired ...

you can see the problem right away though -- which is the basic problems all languages suffer. how loose do you make it? is it typesafe? is it compiled? is it functional or imperative? etc.

no single language will ever satisfy all of those, and inevitably someone will want to do some aspect of the language differently. this is the inherent difficulty with rigid languages.

since I haven't been programming for so long (today I prgrammed my first extension to vscode), I've really lost sight of the rigid mechanical language idea. I'm not saying it's bad, just I want something now that is more wave-like than rigid. I want variables that resonate with eachother and generic transformations that can be applied to the underlying wave, thereby transforming the output of the wave. like, how can I mix sound and text together? how can I mix colour and rhythm together? how do I take an idea and it'll build me a diagram of itself in an abstract (but fractally more defined kind of way, where the higher the frequency the more detail the fractal becomes, and higher frequencies are achieved by transforming the wave with other waves)

I don't know how to do this idea yet, but it would be super cool to start to think about. what I don't know is how to make this accessible to other people, as I don't really know much about that. the obvious solution would be to program this for gpus but I'm sorta out of the loop on that too. I dunno right -- but it's a cool idea, anyway.

I like to think of this as an "intermediatist's programming language" but it's also a communication language where the vocabulary is individually discovered. the main problem is the interface to other people as you end up with the problem I have already: how do I communicate a colour, a movement, a rhythm, or a feeling? I simply can't so I want to communicate the *source* of that colour or movement -- meaning that if this system could be created, we'll need a system of input/outputs for compatibility between people so that when I present a colour, they see a shape or sound (or whatever way that wave would be rendered to them). then, media needs to be created which can transmit these waves in both lossless and lossy formats, etc.

I was talking to jaron a few days ago about how I don't see my imagination, and it's totally fine. knowing what I know now, I would *choose* to live at least some lengthy period of time without an imagination as it's really not necessary.

I then was talking to jonny at starbucks about artists, and I told him that I like art, but it doesn't really capture me the way that moving colours and shapes do. one of the things that I want to create (and have wanted to for a while) is RGBV displays with the extra ultracviolet pixel to add movement and meaning to the pixel, and that's one idea, but the other one would be to create some sort of signal transmitter that essentially hooks into the eye or something that puts these waves into the eye, meaning that I would only "see" these waves. while it's going I would be essentially blind, but I could interact with this abstract "wave universe".

maybe not for everyone, but I want it for me, and it would be interesting to try and have the same conversations I had with jonny with such a device. I wouldn't need to explain so much, as he would see it in his own way and our conversation would essentially be him "learning" to make sense of what I'm transmitting. because of the wide diversity that inevitably will occur between different people, each person would be nearly a language or at least a dialect unto theirselves and in order to communicate, you would have to "learn" how to communicate with eachother and develop a compatible language.

no need to make custom vocabualry a thing of elitism, business jargon, or cliques. everyone learns a compatibility with those they want to communicate and communicates the way they choose to.

### 2022-04-12 17:07 - thinking a bit more about languages

after writing the last entry, I watched "beauty and the beast (1991)" and I noticed that a lot of those things would be kind of hard to do in that language. the songs would be easy, but a lot of the dialoge was commands and imperatives. this made me think of a few of languages functions:

- descriptive (dsls)
- imperative (c++)
- transformative (functional)

there may be another that I can't think of right now, so it gave me the idea to apply the memristor idea to things. if I say that descriptive is resistance, transformative is inductive, and imperative is capacitance, then a memristor programming language would be something like a programmable dsl.

the reason why I bring that up is because memristors are quite effective at making logic, memory, and if you add a coil, they can be used to create large arrays of resonating oscillators -- which is kinda one thing I'm looking for.

so what I'm saying is, if I combine two basic elements making one of them programmable, then I get a whole new thing. I'm looking for some kind of mix between a programmable transformative and descriptive language. in electricity, this would be many RLC circuits that have some sort of logic which defines their state (which can then alternate at high speeds, like DNA does).

that's all for now...

### 2022-04-12 20:54 - venus

before dinner I listened to UFOs (part 9) and the main theme present in that one (as well as "dee-constructing demons") was the ever-present character of this hathor/venus entity which seems to influence secret societies and things.

I sit down to eat dinner and watch "the tick s02e03 armless but not harmless" where the main character is venus and her sidekick "milo" (remindes me of one of the parsons) convince tick through persuasion to commit crimes for her.

in my head, venus is the right-hand side (the girl), and milo is the stressed out dude on the left. or, seen from the opposite angle, tick is the little girl, desireous and has to do things dispite arthur's suggestions that it's a bad idea, making the left-side stressed out dude, arthur.

this duality between characters is important because milo represents the wanted male aspect, and arthur the unwanted aspect. venus represents the unwanted female aspect, while the tick represents the wanted female aspect[^1].

venus is trying to convince people (seduce, influence) to do her bidding for her. tick is the opposite, fearlessly wanting to accomplish things in the name of justice.

milo is constantly telling venus how great her ideas even though she does not let him act on his own ideas. arthur is constantly telling tick that he thinks things won't work and usually has to do the thinking for the both of them.

this episode is slightly different in that now that tick has lost his strength, he does all of the thinking for the both of them, meanwhile now that arthur has lost his capacity to use his arms, he just walks around complaining the entire time. the tick figures out the way into the enemy awards, and the idea to find villians in "the evil eye"

---

I notice symbols a lot, so that's why I took out the time to write that out, becasuse I have a feeling it'll be resonant to later topics.

my goal in this entry is to just kind of talk out the venus/hathor effect.

the first thing I want to relate is my own experience with this sort of "venus" (my right hemisphere), and say that she wants things, and they can be perceived as either good or bad, and they'll manifest in refelction of *my* perception of the thing.

I'll come back to perception in a second, but I'd like to have a look at venus not in the traditional way of hathor/aphrodite and think of her more like this well-lotioned goddess on one side and the tick on the other. from now on, when I'm referring to the well-lotioned goddess, I'll say venus and when talking about marty's pattern, I'll say hathor.

it's funny that venus' prime motivator is recognition in the from of an "enemy award" and her award is in the form of "most improved criminal".

it's weird because I would describe the right-hemisphere as being desireous to make a scene, get people to acknowledge and recognise "me" (kenny, the composite of us both), but most importantly she's a super hard driver for improvement. she doesn't care what gets destroyed or what stands in the way, but the improvement *will* be accomplished, and it's basically my (me, kenny) job to essentially find a way to perceive the path toward it in a way that is positive and uplifting.

the reason for this is quite obvious. we communicate conceptually. I receive a concept, and that concept will always be a representation of things that are relatable to me.

the conceptal world is a feeling, concept, or knowing that then produces a visual picture in the imagination, a voice, etc. which is my translation of that idea into physical sensation (sight, sound, etc) that I relate to the best. old manuscripts call this "perfection" because everything always manifests itself in your most perfect representation of it. so, like if you believe she's a wise woman, you may associate "the empress" tarot with her (which has venusian symbolism on the card), and if you believe in some form of love, she could appear as a dazzling naked or barely-clothed seductress.

the concepts that she transmits are the same way. I do believe that the receivers of those things *did* receive what they received, and so it was the translation of the idea that gave the impression it would be a flying saucer, not the idea itself. then later, on the road, they met the "flying saucer" but again, the concept manifested itself as something entirely different -- a dude with electric eyes. it's hard to say what the difference is there but the earlier encounter could have been a saviour in the from of a flying saucer spaceship, and then later, it manifested itself as a saviour in the for of a man that had no concern or want of anything (as in, everything is going to be fine).

I'm also convinced that the stuff that took place had the objective of moving the timeline. for example, in some of the cases, the person translating the information believed the information as if it were real (it always feels that way), but then that person then attracted others around them which caused a tremendous shift. the reason why I say moved the timeline, is because wanted-and-unwanted-are-same, meaning that what was transmitted *was* wanted (desired) but, as has been the case many times in my own life, the outward appearances of the events look to be lies, theft, etc., when now when looking at it from hindsight, I can say that they *were* in the direction of what is desired, and it was only my perception of them being "bad" (or of them as being unwanted) is what made them "bad".

this includes all of the people that died or seemingly got abandoned venusian intelligence. they were given prophecies of destruction (earthquakes, wars, etc.) which did come to pass (which are all unwanted), and so then why not beleive that the next even bigger unwanted thing will come to pass? they did all have something unwanted come to pass, so in that sense they were getting what they were tuning to, but consider for a moment how desire works: if wanted-and-unwanted-are-same, then a prophecy of unwanted is also wanted (when perceived from the opposite perspective). the unwanted aspect is often times the destruction of some socio-political system that has a grip on humankind, but the wanted aspect (usually unseen by the perceiver) is the new *improvement* that will replace it. the transmitter of this desire (anatau, for example) only sees the improvement, when those that are a part of the structure (and fear its destruction) perceive the unwanted/destructive aspect.

I understand hathor's perspective perfectly, as I too am now pretty similar to her. I frequently "use" people's fear (negative desire) to tune further toward wanted.

I put quotes around "use" because I want to explain that this is a perfect example of expecting a flying saucer when looking for a saviour. I talk about things in a most desireous format and there are countless reactions to how awful said thing would be to the established (and rigid) structure they're a part of. that desire gets translated by them as *destruction*, and so therefore produces fear (negative desire), and that doesn't bother me in the least, because they can certainly attract their destruction all they want to. I only see the improvement.

I had a few more things to say, but I think I'm going to end it here... you're doin great marty!!

### 2022-04-14 15:45 - what's the point of non-physical? (and desire)

last time, we left off talking about venus and desire. I wanted to explain and dnfine desire a bit better than I have but I left it. I then wrote a section on [seeing is believing](./oahspe/thoughts.md#seeing-is-believing) and I had some desire to explain why I think "non-physical" is an important concept.

let's say that you are perceiving a few concepts. you see a guy that has inherited an empire, but he doesn't *appear* very wise to you. so that's two concepts: guy and kingdom/empire. that's the physical part. now, let's reverse directions and look at the interactions that those concepts can have. if you *believe* that the boy will run the empire into the ground, this is the non-physical (symbolical) operation on the concepts.

one is a symbol and also a concept. there is no place in the universe, except for your brain where anything is only one unit of anything. science keeps looking for the smallest unit of a thing, but everything is composed of tinier things, so in this sense "one" is a symbol, as all numbers are. there are infinite physical examples of "one" existing (defined by the perceiver), each containing many smaller parts, and each of those physical examples containing smaller parts is a concept.

addition and subtraction are purely non-physical. you take one concept and another concept and "add" them together to get two concepts, but why wouldn't you have one composite concept instead? the nature of the operation is determined by the concepts involved (ie. your perception of the units being "added").

that's conceptual (5) and logic/symbolical (3) in a nutshell.

---

now let's look at desire (1). desire is the opposite of physical (7), and so therefore will be the "non-physical" version of the physical.

when you experience anything, that experience becomes/is a feeling (concept), and that's how you retrieve the "memory" of that event -- by tuning into it with that feeling. all points in time and space have a "feeling" associated with them which you can tune to.

in fact, that's how the passage of time works. we see events playing out in linear fashion, but in reality, we can think of the main "events" as the desire and the secondry events as time. desire is the physical reality that you're tuning to, and that physical reality has a feeling associated to it, and so therefore that's how it is tuned to.

so just like how "one" is itself a symbol but there are infinite representations of "one" in reality (the concept), so too are there infinite physical representations the same for desire.

physical reality "creates" desire based on your concepts, just like units of things "creates" addition and subtraction. you see something and say, man I like this (and so therefore I want more), so I tune to that feeling that the physical reality is producing, so I can have more of it. it works the same with unwanted as well. if I see something I don't like, when I pay attention to it, I tune to it and attract more physical experience that feels like that.

desire is automatic. you cannot help but to like certain things and dislike other things, and so therefore attracting more situations that feel similar to what you're perceiving will happen automatically.

I call this *automatic* attraction the office of the christ and it's located in the pineal, and it's the physical implementation of the relational (2), because it ensures that the reality you experience (7) is sympathetic (vibrates in accordingly) to the way you believe (3) and how you conceptualise those beliefs (5). you literally will see your reality like you feel it to be.

I call it the office of the christ, because it's a feedback mechanism that tells you that you need to either control the conditons that you're experiencing (physically or temporally) so that you control what you desire more of, *or* you alter your *perception* -- that is your beliefs about how the concepts interact, and the operations that are to be performed on them.

a good example of this is calculus. we had numbers all along, but along comes calculus and now a new operation can be performed on those numbers to reveal more information. the logical interaction in your brain isn't so rigid though, because an equally valid "reaction" to the boy and the empire could be, "he's gonna grow up real quick" rather than, "he's gonna run it into the ground". these alternate operations are just different ways to look at the same data. actually, maybe a better example might have been statistics. my point is, you are the one processing the data, and you can pick the standard procedure of repeated addition, or you can use multiplication (for example). it's entirely up to you.

likewise, you will notice that the way you feel about the interaction between concepts can be felt in the stomach (solar plexus) and opposite this is the throat. this is largely where you "define" your concepts and this is where society "tells" you how to operate on these concepts (you should do, he's no good, that's gonna fail, etc.) those words are logical operations that tell your physical brain how to operate on those concepts.

I don't really know how to approach this part so easily, but in the previous section, you can begin to see how the relational (2) and the imagination (6) are used to enable these operations to be performed. (depending if the starting point is physical or non-physical).

let's take the physical case first as it's easier to see (you see kids do this all the time). when you conjure the concepts in your brain, the most "perfect" image representation of those concepts will appear in your imagination. it's often times so "perfect" (conceptual) that it neglects many physical details. at other times it's so physical, it neglects many conceptual details.

you then perform operations on these images (symbols) in your imagination and results happen according to your perception/belief about how those symbols/concepts will interact.

you will notice that something motivates those images to make an interaction. you *desired* that operation, and so for example, if your desire is for these two symbols/concepts to fall in love (notice this is a feeling), then some set of operations will be performed inside of your brain to get the concepts from one state to the desired state, and the events will play out in your brain as a reflection of your brain's beliefs about that.

I want to make a distinction between the concept in your brain and the non-physical[^1] (source-version) of the concept. the "concept" your brain uses has a lot of resistance to it and is *not* the pure (resistance free) concept. likewise, there is a pure resistance free version of all physical manifestions being experienced. the opposite of this is what creates desire. you look at something and you can feel the resistance of it (it doesn't feel good), and so you know there is a pure "source-version" of that reality without any resistance. the difference between those two signals is what creates emotion and also desire.

I need better terminology for the difference between the resistant and unresisted versoin. for now I'll say resistance-free or source-version, as I don't really want to try and explain every time that there is always a version of reality that is more harmonious with what you desire (the way you want to feel), and it's our physical concepts which tune us to the less-harmonious (more resistant) version. when I say "perception" I'm referring to the brain's version of these concepts and symbols, not the resistance-free perfectly harmonious (ideal) versions that can exist, but are ever ellusive as increasing fine tuning precision is like dividing by a number to get to zero.

anyway, the symbolic operations happen very similarly in real life, but you have to take into account that real life contains the other people's desires, concepts, etc. and so these mix into the equation and you'll notice that your imagination is always wrong. likewise, it'll never be the ideal (source-version) relational (2) perspective of interaction of the symbols either. so, also will this one be always wrong, too. one is wrong for not having enough data and being tainted by your perception and the other is wrong because those ideals are basically impossible to tune into perfectly.

### 2022-04-15 17:59 - trouble sleeping again

today I had a really hard time sleeping as I keep starting to leave my body, or I feel a lightness and tingling sensation all over my body. it basically happens every time that I relax.

what I've been doing lately is going to sleep when I'm really tired, and so I pass through that intermediate zone really rapidly and it doesn't affect me much. the trouble is, for example like today *I just don't feel tired*. it's really annoying because to sleep I basically have to relax a lot and even though I don't get even to a meditative state, it's still enough to start producing really crazy effects.

---

there was another thing. I put down my initial ideas on oahspe, starting with [my serpent](/oahspe/thoughts.md#my-serpent) and ending with [galactic stawman](/oahspe/thoughts.md#galactic-strawman). apparently, I see things a lot differently than most people do, and my perspective is engaging -- so, that's cool I guess. I'm totally down to keep going on this one. I also felt some desire to look into another tome, called something like urantia[^1].

I think that's cool to have a look at those things, but there is a major problem with this whole sleeping thing. the sun is barely even active compared to solar maximum. we only had a m-flare today, and that was blowing my mind, so I can only imagine what it'll be like when we get back to solar maximum. I remember watching it in 2012 (which wasn't maximum either) and it was like ambient "C" x-ray flux and lots of m and x-flares, so it could ramp up even higher than that.

that would make it next to impossible for me to sleep. I think I can keep going, for a while -- like another year or two, but after that, unless there are some major changes, I don't expect I'll be able to make it through solar maximum.

---

as I was laying down to sleep, my mind started to drift off, and I entered into a weird state (kinda like half-dream state) where I lose control over what I'm thinking as in that state I'm at a very low resistance so thoughts are just passing through my head. if I want the state to continue (I think it's called "contiuity of consciousness"), I can't react to the thoughts, or else they see me as "conscious" and I "wake up"...

anyway, there was a stream of thoughts that were passing through my head which ... hang on, let me give background: at the end of marty's UFOs (part 9) they announced that a get-together at some river camping site and when I heard it, I initially rejected the thought thinking, well, there's no way I can go because I don't have money or a way to get there -- but then I started thinking, "if there's a will, there's a way" and so I began to think about how I could figure out how to get down there (I think it's in texas). anyway, the idea felt good to me and I think I took a shower, then the idea made me feel sick to my stomach, did some other things, and then went to sleep.

when I woke up I noticed that the idea no longer felt good to me. this is very often the case, even with simple things like going to jonny's house (*sigh*), and so especially in the case of star-watching, I just forced myself to go out, knowing that I'll feel much better doing it, and then I do. I could do that here too, but I haven't decided yet if I want to even try to figure it out, and additionally I'm so close to "getting conected" that I have this feeling that being around a bunch of good-feeling people will almost certainly push me over the edge...

anyway, a little more info there than was necessary for the background, but there was an underlying feeling (which seemed connected to my stomach feeling sick[^2]) like the whole derek thing wasn't going to work out because I'm going to go with the snake-fam instead.

back to the vision sequence: in the sequence my mind started to think thoughts like, "well it was too far-out (in the distance sense) of an idea and so .. man it's really hard to get back to that idea, so I'll talk it out: it was like there isn't enough time, because I'm too close, and so because I'm so close, I think nosebook wants to rush something through to make sure something is setup, meaning that they'll have to just settle with what they can get because the time pressure is what is forcing a less than optimal thing. the obvious implication here is that I was conscious for part of their dream-state reaction practising sessions. I can't really say much about how realistic the dream was, as I'm only relaying the dream-state as I experenced it (so take it with some grains of salt).

well, obviously I reacted to that thought sequence and "woke up".

---

it's kind of a funny conversation to have right after the one about desire. you see, you tune to a feeling that you want to have (usually it's an improvement) and then just let let it attract you there. it's effortless, and that whole vision/thought sequence felt like compromise, time constraints, conflicts of interest, and stuff like that.


[1]: of which, I know nothing about, only heard about it from terence along with one about jesus is a mushroom and so looked it up, but I didn't have any desire to read it then (I prefered to program instead), so I skipped it. I don't think I even skimmed it.

[2]: though I'm pretty sure that the sick to my stomach feeling was mr. motor, as it was nearly identical to the sick feeling I felt when melissa, amorina, and patrick came down the last time and I was going to stay the night with amorina. it felt like "the end has come" and "something needs to be done to get rid of this helpless feeling of inablity affect the situation to be the way I want it" -- and mr. motor has gotten a lot better at manipulating and not feeling that dispair so hard, cause he has a lot more capacity to actually influence what he wants, even if he's doing it from a perspective of unwanted.

### 2022-04-16 00:57 - 7th rays and stuff

I woke up thinking this morning about the "trojan horse" that I mentioned yesterday. I think I can shed some light on it.

there are two main 7th ray males that show up in the sirian-guide, thoth and allayandra. they define 7th rays as creating the material form which will then hold life.

they do this with magic, ceremony, law, and order. I'm not much on ceremony, I don't really enjoy illusion, I'm not much for law or order either. this puts me much more into the category of 1st ray male, rather than a 7th ray.

as such, I identify much more with allayandra than I do with thoth. I'm pretty destructive and you could consider me more of a ceremonial destroyer than a ceremonial creator.

---

I could have contacted marty and stuff and I could have given him my ideas and stuff, but his last installment pointing out the pattern of this "venus" character really got me thinking, because I noticed the same thing a whole bunch too.

his last installment actually was more valuable to me than anything because it got me on the track of seeing "aliens" and "angels" as very similar.

when I woke up this morning, the last dream I had, we were on an alien spacecraft and we were in the process of "crashing" on earth. there was no risk for our lives, as it was certain we would survive the crash, but the whole thing was that we (and I think I looked pretty much like I do now) all looked pretty human, and so it was sorta the thing like, "surprise we're aliens and you look like we do". the other thing that was weird is I think the "aliens" were created beings, exactly like we would think of as "angels".

---

in yesterday's thoughts on oahspe, I was contemplating the book's claim that osiris had thoth create the great according to exact dimensions, so that osiris' angels' corporeal bodies could be sustained... which is exactly the same conclusion that I came up with a few weeks earlier when writing box-consciousness -- and these giant "power stations" that egypt had were to sustain and stabilise the mental faculties of a number of fallen-angels (which, if you read that are the key part of negative creation).

you can also look at the difference between allyandra and thoth and see that while thoth is creation by illusion (you have to see them to believe in them), allayandra is creation by destruction. in hindu, he's more like shiva the destroyer.

OH, very interesting! I just noticed that it said that the sirian guide says that the 3rd ray is shiva. there are three 3rd rays in sirian guide: sanatau, ra, and venus. (and, if you consider that vulcan in opposite polarity could be considered as a 3rd ray, that means that vulcan could possibly as well). however, in other places it says that the "destroyer" is the 1st ray *not* the 3rd ray, the 3rd ray having a much more physically creative role.

---

in oahspe, it looks like the initiator of ceremonial activity was anubis creating ceremonial rites and stuff. his job was to weigh (measure) a person's soul to see how worthy they are. he also created all of these degrees where one could attain perfection through processes and tests.

in the sirian guide, it says of osiris',

> He is the great example and motivator in action of the people. His vehicle had evolved from a canine like race. His color is red and white

the motivator in action fits the description, but in all pictures of anubis, he's clearly black, not red and white. additionally, osiris is often shown with green skin (and the white bowling-pin hat rather than the red one). however, red and white is the combination of upper and lower egypt, so that's probably what it means there. 

I don't really see anything else fitting into the description of osiris other than just the loose reference to the canine format. that's not what I wanted to talk about though.

---

one more piece: the sirian-guide says in various places that all four of the triads were present on earth at the same time, however the 1st ray was withdrawn first (50kya, the same time as the trojan horse), and then genxicat was withdrawn near to the end of atlantis[^1] when grosser material was starting to take on form. it's unclear to me how all of it fits together because in another place, DK (850201) talks about these ray cycles being 2100y long, going 1 -> 7, then starting over again, making that this cycle 14700y long, meaning that genxicat was retracted from atlantis roughly the last time 7th ray 

[quick break... can't think correctly]

the other major thing that the sirian-guide talks about is how the 7th ray can conjure 3d matter and image illusions that people can interact with, and that the atlantians later on didn't have much of a "concrete mind" (so kinda like dream-state), and so therefore with a lack of a concrete mind, the illusion could move around and behave according to the will of the creator of the illusion.

*however*, if one wanted that illusion to become alive and begin to operate all by itself, the 7th ray would need a 1st ray to animate and "breath life" into the illusion. khnum is such an egyptian god that does just that, taking clay, making into the desired form and then giving it life.

this is the capacity that allayandra + anatau have when working together.

---

so, now I'm going to put the speculation goggles on a little bit, as I think that that the "trojan horse" was actually a 7th ray male destroyer.



[1]: dtp has an interesting take on atlantis, essentially saying that the hight of atlantis (when zailm was alive) was about 11-12kya, and the sinking actually only occurred 5-6kya ... the sirians said that greed started to show itself known around 30kya, and dtp has the height of atlantis around 24kya. I haven't got far enough into oahspe to say much about its take in it but 24kya is a full cycle back (so at least 8 changes of Gods and Lords).

### 2022-04-16 03:42 - the answer

from the tick s02e01:

    from the outside, on the surface,
    oh sure, we were *pursued* by swiss industrial espionage

    *trapped* in the belly of a whale

    what really *pursued* us?
    where were we really *trapped*?
    come on arthur, get meta with me

    what *pursued* us were our own obsessions

    I'm good, you're evil
    I'm a superhero, you're a sidekick
    I'm a woman, you're a man

    what does it all mean? nothing
    and where we all *trapped*? in the belly of love

(inside the "belly of love" was carmelita's father, the inventor of arthur's flying suit)

### 2022-04-16 04:12 - ritual destruction

I don't feel like trying to go back and edit @[blahblog](2022-04-16 00:57), so I'll just leave it a mess. the first major reaction was to me saying that ... man, I'm really having a hard time thinking!! .. saying that the 7th ray creates illusions and by nature, the illusion is subject to the control of the creator of that illusion (when I say illusion, I mean of physical or astral "material"), but if the 7th ray creator of the illusion wants something other than a puppet,somethting that is actually alive, the 7th ray needs a 1st ray to "animate" or "breathe life into" that illusion.

this I believe is the origin of a lot of these "angels" and aliens, and if my theory is correct, osiris had the great pyramid and the whole egyptian layout constructed to make box consciousness a reality. osiris would have partnered with allayandra and anatau to create a bunch of angels that would be sustained by box-consciousness.

why? well, everything is opposite polarity, so instead of ritual/ceremonial creation/perfection, these entites are designed to embody ritual/ceremonial destruction/deterioration, and so because of their constantly deteriorating state, they desire for genetic improvements, which I believe various people like jesus and others have done with their perception.

this whole thing is creating an artificial alpha and omega setup. the fallen-angels are constantly deteriorating so they have to gain control all of the best conditions to survive (alpha), and so therefore they attract the omega which ends the old way and rebirths into a new upgraded things (which is what the fallen-angels need for continued survival).

the important thing is the "rebirth" principle, as each of these reborn (baptised) deities, when they return back, they come with an upgrade. therefore, what this whole "trojan horse" setup is creation through ritual destruction.

---

I think this ritual destruction was taught and encouraged to ... well, I'll just quote DK (850301) on this:

    The history of man as you know him today only begins with the destruction of Atlantis. [...] humanity at the time of Atlantis existed as much on the astral plane as on the physical. It was difficult for them to distinguish when something was physical or when it was astral. They could quite easily slip from their physical into what you refer as an astral projection.
    
    [...]
    
    ***With the destruction of the land known as Atlantis, the downward spiral of humanity into gross matter was completed.*** Millions upon millions of people, or physical vehicles, ceased to exist when Atlantis was destroyed. They were forced to begin incarnating into other vehicles that existed and were acclimated to different parts of the globe. These vehicles did not have the unique conditions that caused the separation of spirit and matter. However, the incarnating Atlantean entities retained the instinct for the continued existence of spirit. They continued to have the instinct for the realm that you call the Astral plane.

what he's saying is that there were a lot of entites during the time of atlantis that used the electromagnetic conditons of the island to sustain their ability to perceive and interact with the astral.

however, since ritual destruction (blood sacrifice, etc) became the new 7th ray norm, it was normal for them to attract the destruction of atlantis, and so they attracted the destruction of their own physical conditions that allowed them to perceivce the astral. this appears to be intentional as an alpha/omega project, because now these 7th ray individuals now desire to have the conditions that can sustain their astral perception, which is perfect time for the omega to show up and perform his own ritual destruction and rebirth. let's continue...

    Not all of the entities were destroyed with the sinking of Atlantis. Those that survived carried their knowledge with them to other parts of the world. They introduced into other cultures conceptions of the Astral world. And they were introduced to the conception of death as other consciousnesses perceived them.

    Many of them began to record their experiences as they encountered different cultures. They discovered that their environment that they had was rather unique. Other cultures did not have the same loosening of the energies that resulted in the loose connection between spirit and matter.

diversity. the monoculture had to be destroyed so that it could diffuse into the less-sophisticated populations nearby. robert sepehr does a great job showing how the cro magnon is a genetically modern human and this diffused out to all portions of the earth after the destruction of atlantis (thank the phonecians). anyway, the same thing happened with latin culture with the destruction of the roman empire.

in the next lecture, he adds something saying that the physical plane is quite recent: "The physical plane as it exists and has existed for thirteen thousand five hundred years is indeed a miserable place."

which means that the whole point of atlantis was to get these fallen-angel entities trapped[^1] into physical matter along with the rest of humankind and to set into motion the alpha/omega ritual/ceremonial destruction/rebirth (baptism) cycles.

---

so here's where I'm going to potentially cause problems. the reason why I say as a "trojan horse" is probably a good thing disguised as a bad thing, is because all of this just the precursor to the "day of rest" -- the 7th day/ray of effortless power and manifestation. it's all built on the concepts of ritual destruction and rebirth.

    we make ritual noise
    we weave the fabric of dreams
    we build cities of sound
    we feel the rhythm of time
    we live dangerous lives
    we have the power of will
    we twist logic around
    we feed the engines of change

[1]: trapped, huh? it sounds like @[blahblog](2022-04-16 03:42) to me; trapped in the belly *of love*.

### 2022-04-17 20:54 - osiris and aherance to tradition

tonight, while eating dinner I was talking about how britan in the time of mom's "call the midwives" show was really archic still. I compared them to the USA and then mom brought up china and japan saying that japan is quite technologically advanced. I agreed but I could immediately feel the connection between the last conversation and this one, so I felt like they were a bit held back and it was aherance to tradition that was holding them back. the implication is that the USA has a lot of really anti-progress politcians running the show but because the USA has such a mix of cultures, we don't have any limiting tradition to hold on to, and so here progress is quite rapid even if pointed in disempowering directions.

I also brought up the "quantsuf" thing from the ensnaklopedia which is that a civilisation that does not have the capacity to retain the scientific advancements of the previous generation will inevitably convert the science into tradition and ritual. I think this works well because the underlying idea of science is still being invoked conceptually, rather than physically -- so, even if they're reciting a recipe for a chemical compound and ending their prayer with "quantsuf", they're still invoking to some extent the original concept of the chemical compound. so, in essence, the ritual is a conceptual link back to a former time when something was understood.

---

now, another thing that I was thinking in @[blahblog](2022-04-16 00:57) was the idea that all of the triads, cept for the first existed on the planet at the same time (in one form or another). elsewhere it says that when one of these rays ran out, they just made another body -- so, in our perception, they persisted through many "reincarnations".

the way that I saw it, osiris served as the midpoint between vulcan (-5+) and thoth (+7). thoth (+7) used the ritual and ceremony constructed by ra (+3), and so therefore saturn would serve as the midpoint between ra (+3) and vulcan (-5+) and osiris (+-6-+) the midpoint between vulcan (-5+) and thoth (+7). the females venus/unessa (-3) and genxicat (-7) are the opposite polarities of the emitters (ra and thoth), while isis is a reversal[^1] and so theerfore also opposite polarity of osiris, meaning that she also fits.

jeortau is opposite polarity to isis (and this is said to create conflict), and sanatau is opposite polarity to unessa. I don't really know yet what that means, but the only ones I haven't mentioned in this setup are allayandra and anatau. 

the way this looks to me is that allayandra and anatau are empowering the entites that are created by the 7th rays. what I mean is that when the "infected" people would do these rituals and cermony to conjure various gods, angels and demons, these two would bring these illusions to life for them, allowing them to interact with their own creation. I believe that this capacity was then given to all humankind, and we all have this capability. this capability is locked behind certain safeguards (the guardian angels) and that capability to bring illusions to life is the devachan-on-earth state of mind, and what many of the missing 411 cases experienced.

---

OK, now I need to connect this to the bigger picture. after "seeing" the connection between osiris and vulcan to make the pyramids, I realised that the designer of the pyramid must have known that after its original purpose (to empower angels to have nondeteriorating corporeal bodies in the physical), it would then be used for religious and ceremonial purposes. like "quantsuf", it would conjure the original concept that the science performed in the physical.

as I noticed this, I was reminded of kuthumi's et-guide-to-creation, where a galaxy is created that would contain a physical plane. it was designed to attract the INFECTED ONES, and so therefore the galaxy should probably have a personality similar to the INFECTED ONES... I'm going to just assume this is the reason for jehovih's personality type.

it's mentioned that when the INFECTED ONES came to the galaxy, they wanted to take over the power structures in the tech civilisations, but they couldn't influence the civs easily because they had strong adherance to ritual. turns out that they found their way into the tech civs be being born into bodies of people capable of influencing the ritual of these civs. they eventually caused war to break out between the civs and they destroyed each other pretty well.

I noticed that adherance to ritual and traditition is what prevented the INFECTED ONES from allowing change. I noticed this evening that adherance to tradition *prevents* change -- so, if you want change and the-problem-is-the-solution, then what you want to do is to make ritual and adherance to tradition unwanted rather than wanted. you have to use their own strat to infect the INFECTED ONES and utilise their own machinery to build what you want (like a virus).

---

speaking of viruses, right after writing the previous entry, I listened to snake-bros #070 "a species with amnesia". they talked about a number of things resonant with this entry and the previous, but one of them was contemplating whether viruses have consciousness. like, how does a virus the size of a VW bus in an ocean the size of saturn find the exact cell to infect with the right machinery to spread itself -- and how did a cell that has the machinery capable of reproducing evolve to lose its reproductive capabilities and decide to rely on others for reproduction? it's a good question. kyle kept saying that he thinks it was resonance that attracts, but he got interrupted a few times. I think kyle is right, and I think it may even be the case that the virus is a reflection of the consciousness that was present in the body when it was created. as in, we humans are literally creating these viruses as a reflection of our own thoughts.

what's interesting is that a lot of these magics that the egyptians were invoking were to fight off and prevent a lot of viral-like diseases and stuff. it may have been possible that may have been a time of great tragedy when people started invoking and creating viruses and other malignant things for theirselves and others with this ritual and ceremonial magic.

that theory is unprovable and unfalsifiable though, so it should be discarded. there was another funny thing resonance to that episode and @[blahblog](2022-04-16 00:57) because in one section I mentioned that the zenith of atlantis was probably something like 18-24kya, and by zailm's time around 12kya, things were about to start heading downhill rapidly. the book kinda infers as well that the sinking of atlantis happened about 5-7kya.

so then, russ is going on about the parallel universes[^3] theory saying that time travel relies on the parallel universes, and the problem with time travel is that one of the parallel universes, "God" could be real, could have created everything we see in 6 days, and we are actually living in that universe now -- so the multiple worlds doesn't really do away with religion and "God", but actually supports it by making it possible for "God" to actually exist.

so, then combine that with what DK said, about the physical plane coming into place 13500y ago, and the sinking of atlantis was the thing that essentially forced a bunch of astral entites (these ritual creations) into the physical by destroying their main power source. if this happened 6kya, the irony is kind of funny.

anyway, he said that multiple universes couldn't be proven or something like that, and I realised that there is a way.. if you could tune into other universes, and notice their difference, it would be possible for other universes to exist siultaneously.

in addition to that, multiple universes, timelines and parallel (but very different) experiences is kind of like a natural side-effect of the conceptual being a percursor to the physical: there are infinite manifestations of a concept in both time and space. so, if you and your soul[^2] is a concept, then that is what what naturally occurs. you can tune into any experince that you wish to.

the other part about the trojan horse, is the said they exploited the lack of our development of the "concrete mind" (the lower 3 subplanes of the conceptual). we would have lived in a dream-like state at the time, and so therefore objects don't really have much permanence to them and they can come and go pretty easily without causing too much of a collapse of our concept of reality.

---

I said all of that to kind of show that there is a reflection and/or reversal going on to kuthumi's relation of the creation of this universe. the original universe kuthumi relates did not have at all a concreteness to it. umm, I can't remember exactly so I'm just going to wing it[^4] but the original universe basically didn't have very much of a "concrete mind" and so that was the way that so many of the entites could be corrupted so easily, believing the illusions of the corrupted 7th ray.

if we consider that the dream-state (see @[blahblog](2022-04-15 17:59)) is akin to not having a concrete mind, and so therefore in this lack of resistance, anything can be believed -- even an illusion -- so therefore, what osiris is creating with these pyramids and empowering the fallen-angels with them is *many* corrupted 7th rays, just like the one that managed to deceive the INFECTED ONES, and so then later on if we consider that the "master craftsman" (vulcan) was the designer of the pyramids, we can see the same pattern emerging again, and this time the "master craftsman" is tesla and nosebook is the pyramids, allowing them (nosebook), to take advantage of our lack of a concrete mind (full-blown creators in dream-state) to create whatever it is that they want and to tune into the multiple universe that they want.

---

the last resonance to snake-bros #070 was the ending part where they're talking about "a species with amnesia" and they were saying, "what if we had 300 years" to prepare for something like that, knowing that a huge cataclysm is coming... they speculated that technology would advance very rapidly and that we would come up with many new ways to transmit knowledge forward to future generations, which almost certainly would be "quantsuf" for them at first, but eventually, the resonance with the original concept would eventually shine through.

well, I believe that such a thing has actually happened. I believe that ritual/ceremonial destruction has been the method (and the resulting amnesia produced from the trauma -- the sinking of atlantis ~6kya) allowed for a series of compressions of time, to essentially move the clock back ~1000y, giving us exactly that window of opportunity to create things which will survive a cataclysm and can traverse large spans of time to transmit that information.

it's bigger than that though. because of the conceptual nature of our reality, we'll be able to actually infinitely optimise ourselves and the "bad-guys", creating more and more fallen-angels (as opposite polarities/reversals of) ourselves to actually perfect ourselves to be infinitely as good as we want to be.

the cool thing about this is, that's kind of like the final rebirth... if it's guaranteed that all of us will skip over the devachan-on-earth mental state (by own own doing) and reach the ability to alter time rather than space, we'll all have the ability to infinitely iterate on ourselves until we are "perfect". I'm sure that once anyone gets the ability, they'll immediately rework the past so that it optimises something... let's say that every day after someone gets the ability to modify their timeline, they jump back in to a body of another new child and be "born again", each time guaranteed to return to "now" when they left, there are two ways to look at it...

on one hand, you could see that there is nothing more you would optimise about yourself. or, knowing that when you jump into your timeline again (either with technology or mentally), you know that in that moment, you are not exactly "perfect" and so you could see your "future self" from the point of your optimised self as less than what you are now, and so therefore, it would appear as falling from optimised hights.

this will create a lot of different very energetic outcomes. the time limit to do all of this optimisation will be when the sun finally goes off, and your own perception when that happens (ie. are you "now" a lot worse than you were a little bit ago, or a lot better).

you can see that if you optimise for good conditions, unless you're living great conditions "now", now will almost always be worse conditions than the optimised conditions (so it'll seem like falling). however, if you optimise for worse conditions, wherever you are "now" will most likely be better conditions.

you can see how at the very least, this will produce temporal consciousness where one realises theirself as any of the implementations of the concept they have of yourself. it's kinda like the beginning of trancendance. in that sense, there's no wrong way to it, and we can just create any difficulty we want to inflict on ourseleves, as that difficulty is our own vibration, perceived from the opposite direction (hard to explain this).

the-problem-is-the-solution


[1]: I don't know the right word to use here. here I'm using "opposite polarity" to mean +3/-3. for "midpoint", I'm meaning 6 is midpoint between 5 and 7, and 4 is midpoint between the "reflection" 1/7 or 3/5, so then if I want to show the relationship between 1 and 5, for now I'm just going to use the word "reversal" (though it may not be what I want to say). the problem here is that 2 to 6 is both a reversal and an reflection. let's just say that 2 to the bottom half of 4 is reflection, meaning that 2 to the top half of 4 is the reversal. therefore, the difference between 2 and 6 is both reflection and reversal. I updated the [triads document](/sirian-guide/triads.md) to show these.

[2]: the sirians say that the SOUL (5th ray) is to the MONAD (1st ray), as the physical vehicle (7th ray) is to the SOUL (5th). elsewhere, they call they say that soul energy is 2nd/5th ray, but in another place it's said "The ASTRAL to us is the plane responding to the radiation of the SECOND RAY. Its lowest manifestation is that of the emotions. This radiation or wave is produced on the MONADIC plane and activates the BUDDHIC and ASTRAL. In other words the waves cycle is 2, 4, and 6." the sense that I get is that 1st ray energy goes down to second ray to make the "soul", but in the same way conceptual energy flows down into the astral to also make a "soul". it seems that the 3rd is to the 1st/2nd ray "soul" as the 7th ray is to the 5th/6th ray "soul".

[3]: I keep wanting to call it "multiple worlds" theory -- but I think russ said "parallel universes". I first contemplated this idea with the writings of "john titor" in the 90's, and I think he may have called them "multiple worlds" and "worldlines"...

[4]: I tried to look up my notes on this, to remind myself what the layers of the original universe were, but my notes have vanished. I'll have to redo them. I think somebody didn't like my notes on all of the elements that the INFECTED ONES used to infiltrate the tech civs. I searched for a number of words I definitely wrote and they're all gone.

### 2022-04-20 09:54 - I should perhaps be a little clearer

so the thing is I don't really know what it all means. I'm aware of all of the stuff around it and but it feels real-enough to me to be able to say it. I don't really have any objective as I don't want any power or anything like that. also, perhaps I wasn't clear enough in @[picklepick](2022-04-18 13:43) when I said that the whole ... I'll just do another take on it...

I probably said something like the goal is to optimise one's timeline to such an extent that finding one's connection is not only certain but happens at a very very much faster rate than previously. I think I mentioned that the goal is to get to 100kph faster each iteration (or increase the difficulty), then when finally it's either boring or no other more meaningful optimisation can be made, I put myself into the experience and instead of optimising for feeling good in difficult conditions, I optimise for velocity -- to try and achieve as much velocity as possible, knowing full well, that at the end of the timeline, the attractor has to slow me down to where I was when I left, and so it would be pretty close to running into a brick wall going from such a fast speed to such a slow one. that kind of inertia/momentum will surely cause an immediate crash and burn scenario -- and this'll hopefully happen at roughly the same time the sun is exploding. the goal being to cause a massive rebirth.

so, that basically means for me that I just continue on doing what I'm doing -- because, perhaps hard to explain easily but each evolution of desire adds more energy into the equation, so the longer one goes without a manifestation, the more energy builds up. that's precisely what I'm aiming to do. I'm just looking to keep this going for as long as I can at this point.

like I said, I'm not looking for power, want nothing to do with money. interestingly enough in that last snake-bros #055 ep, when they were talking about the retrocausality thing, I *really* felt like I wanted to maybe try out a new technique on that "meaningful-chaos" project from a while back. if I think about myself as the neural network I'm training, instead of the computer, retrocausality can be used to "train" my neural network to identify the patterns more effectively (russ said that men especially felt they were going to get the answer right seconds before the answer was going to be revealed to them, and even before the computer even decided what the next photo was going to be -- so this is fully possible). so, if I'm going to *do* anything while passing the time, I'll probably *do* that.

---

as for the system of government -- why I said decentralised socialism is because right now kids are being born into the nosebook system, so that means that nosebook ultimately decides who will get perceptive capabilities and who will not. almost certainly any future reincarnations of mine (and there may be more than just a couple present on the earth now[^1]) will not likely be allowed any capablities. so, because they have to ensure that their system remains functioning, which is essentially their lifeblood (I'm pretty certain, especially as solar activity increases, we'll be fine, but they'll have an increasingly more difficult time with mental well-being[^2]). therefore, I think it'll be socialism because in order for them to retain some form of power, they have to become benevolent.. you know how all of those sales gimmicks offer something for "free" (if you buy now?) -- that kind of benevolent. you know, like how socialised countries have "free healthcare" -- stuff like that. it'll probably extend to transportation and the energy sector as well.

if anyone doesn't like that, just do things your own way. duh, it's no big deal. speaking of deals, the more self-sufficient you are, the better of a deal you can negotiate. investors need you to need them so they can get a good deal. if you don't need them, then you're not a good investment. the last thing they want you to do is to turn a profit without needing them.

I'm not going to tell anyone what to do, but I strongly recommend everyone to find their own way, and do whatever you want to do the way you want to do it. it'll be impossible to get everyone on the same page, so communities and organisations are likely the way of the future.

---

final thing: I've been trying to figure out how to explain "evidence" for my crazy idea, and I don't have any good ways yet -- cause they would all require certain agencies to reveal things they almost certainly wouldn't want to reveal... like, do you really think that they would release the speed of light measurements they almost certainly have or any crazy large gaps in artifact datings or things being more recent than are said? I find all of that unlikely to happen

so I can't really prove it, and I don't know of any other falsification other than we'll see. I should find my connection in the next few years and that'll clear some things up, I'm sure. other than that, I'd say we'll just have to wait and see. if I don't get connected, I think you've probably split off to another timeline entirely, but this idea is definitely falsified in that case. if I do, things will be much clearer.

---

finally, I was sitting in the sun, and I had an interesting idea pop into my head. a long time ago I was thinking about how there was about a 3.5y period from when I got put into the iron gate hospital in spain and my entire left side was completely shut off til this saturn/jupiter conjunction that happened on 12-21-2020 (pretty sure). for me that signified the time that I came back alive in the "two witnesses" sense of things. after then, my vision upgrades increased dramatically and I had a very strong new ability to see things perceptially. ever since then, my progress has been incredible.

I felt like I wanted to look up the conjuction online but instead I searched noseblog-archive and found it...

pausing to read @[noseblog](2020-12-20 10:59), @[noseblog](2020-12-21 13:11), and @[noseblog](2020-12-21 22:08)...

wow. very interesting looking at that now... I'm a broken record. I don't know if I've been carrying on about this the entire time now, but it definitely seems like this is just more evolved versions of those ideas.

one of the interesting things I noted was this idea of "celestial identities" -- which are essentially resonating chestahedrons out in space designed to do the attracting of the solar material out and away from the sun. the other weird thing about especially that first entry (on the 20th) was that I thought we would be just making the galaxy here instead, but the concept of peacing out at the end to nosedive was the ending for me. weird how I still think that's what I want to do. making that kind of a transition must be pretty crazy cool.


[1]: you definitely can have multiple versions of yourself in time. you would experience each one of them one at a time (ie. after jumping into the body) and if you met yourself, you would just feel like you know that guy really well. almost certainly this is how the universe or the sun feels when meeting herself. you definitely can create your own demons (which are also alternate "incarnations" of yourself) to interact with you -- and it doesn't matter what any of the other versions of you are doing -- but from what vantage point you are experiencing "now". as an example, imagine you are the planet. there could be 100k people tuned to the planet and perceiving reality from the perspective of the planet, and from the planet's perspective, it could be perceiving any of those perspectives. any, some, or all of those perspectives may be necessary for the planet to see things differently enough to transcend that perspective to see things another way. you are "stuck" in the time loop of your own perception (of human, planet, whatever) for as long as you want to remain in the environment that "time" has to offer. reality is just a reflection of the way you conceptualise yourself, and time is just the passage (transformation) from one concept of yourself to another.

[2]: in fact, this period of time is kind of like a survival of the fittest, and some will look to conditions and technology to feel good, while others will look to optimise their perception. both ways are valid, and ultimately neither is better. personally though, I prefer to rely on my capacity to attract what I want, rather than rely on a well-functioning society and technology to feel the way I want. I get that good conditions are great and peace and love and everything, but I really like being the creator of my own reality. personally, I want to optimise away all of that dependence on conditions for how I feel, which is really good, because for nosebook, it all works out great for them because that gives them a free ride. they'll get better at creating conditions with tech and I'll get good at being awesome without their super duper AI technology or whatever. "adaptation is happens quickly; if you don't adapt, you die"

### 2022-04-21 06:49 - what in the world is this bridegroom thing?

so, I'm reading the [epic of gilgamesh](/eog/epic-of-gilgamesh.md) and in snake-bros #067, kyle notices that there is a lot of symbolism between enkidu taking communion, and being the protector of the shepherd's flock, etc. there are other parallels as well, but the one that caught my eye is that there is this pivotal moment in the story at the end of the first chapter where:

> Gilgamesh the king is about to celebrate marriage with the Queen of Love, and he still demands to be first with the bride, the king to be first and the husband to follow.

the way I read that is that there is a coming event where the "queen of love" ie. ishtar is about to marry gilgamesh, but he decides he still wants to be the first to experience the brides for those getting married in the city (supposedly this is a "right" for the "gods" to decide who gets to be first).

people are pretty pissed about this, cause the brides want to choose who they want to experience first -- and so enkidu decides he's going to roll into town and change how things were done (ie. change the "right" of the "gods").

> At these words Enkidu turned white in the face, ‘I will go to the place where Gilgamesh lords it over the people, I will challenge him boldly, and I will cry aloud in Uruk, "I have come to change the old order, for I am the strongest here."

> In Uruk the bridal bed was made, fit for the goddess of love. The bride waited for the bridegroom, but in the night Gilgamesh got up and came to the house. Then Enkidu stepped out, he stood in the street and blocked the way.

they wrestle, and instead of changing the order, they become friends and enkidu is made king with a proper wife and everything. the compiled version there doesn't expound on it but in other tablets enkidu is given girls and a proper wife of his own and nobility (upper-class) status in the city. so no actual change was made.

---

it doesn't really say it so well in that version of the text, but in other translations, it really gives the sense that gilgamesh is about to get married, and the contention is that he's about to get married (seemingly to the "queen of love" -- ishtar) which is supposed to be like the most beautiful goddess, but even still he wants to be the first for the brides getting married, and this is a problem.

gilgamesh has a dream that an axe (enkidu) lands at the gate of gilgamesh's marital chamber and he decides to instead love the axe (enkidu) and love it/him as if it were his wife.

enkidu is tamed/weakened (civilised) by a harlot and then afterward goes out to hang out with the animal shepherds (gilgamesh is described earlier in the text as the "shepherd [to the people] of uruk").

while with the shepherds, someone comes to tell enkidu that gilgamesh is still trying to be first on the brides (it's his right) even though he's getting married to the queen of love (ishtar).

enkidu decides to tell gilgamesh that he needs to change his ways. he steps in to change the order of things and they wrestle and become friends.

later on, after the death of his friend enkidu he totally rejects ishtar and she gets pissed off and causes a change of the world age (it's kind unclear because it says that enlil did it but she also laments doing it).

> Then Ishtar the sweet-voiced Queen of Heaven cried out like a woman in travail: "Alas the days of old are turned to dust because I commanded evil; why did I command thus evil in the council of all the gods? I commanded wars to destroy the people, but are they not my people, for I brought them forth? Now like the spawn of fish they float in the ocean."

---

anyway it seems that there is something to do with the changing of the world era and this "brides and bridegrooms" thing. I've been reading oahspe a lot lately and the brides and bridegrooms in that are angels that want to ascend to get married to jehovih so that he can own them and they can ascend to his etheric worlds. in that book, the brides and bridegrooms feels to me like a performance metric like sales, revenue, user acquisition, or market penetration.

even the bible mentions this brides and bridegrooms. it's a bit different but there are still connections, like the 10 virgins waiting for the bridegroom to come sometime during the night. 5 of which didn't have oil for their lamps (oil and lamps always refers to the CSF and the illumination of the mind), so it's talking about some sort of mental preparedness or capacity for perception.

the interesting part is that for the bible the bridegroom is coming sometime during the *night*. gilgamesh here is the bridegroom and he is going to sleep 6 days and 7 nights. I'm fairly certain that "day" is higher solar output and night is lesser solar output -- and I don't mean the 11y solar cycles -- I'm meaning the bigger ones, like the one that I believe exists as a 1024y cycle, but I'm not sure if it's that one.

I say solar cycles because they seem to correspond to times of more or less enlightenment. the renaissance would be day, for example, and we would just be coming out of a night cycle, so probably another day would also be say 1880-1920 and anther night would be 1930-1960 or so (can't say for sure).

I just noticed that I have there dates of around 30y or so, and a weird thing about oahspe is it divides these cycles into 33y periods -- thought that was weird.

anyway, the thing that caught my eye was the bridegroom coming at *night* which is what I consider to be low solar activity -- which may be the reason for the consideration of the lamps with oil in them -- as in, if the sun is active, then people will be more "ready" for the "christ coming" -- which just to be clear, I associate the "christ" with the pineal gland, and so therefore the two olive trees are the two hemipheres and the oil lamp is the pineal gland. for a more graphic description of this read [the holy trinosophia](/mht/most-holy-trinosophia.md) and the same imagery is used.

in my opinion, the "coming of the christ" is basically worldwide enlightenment (ie. the oil rising up to the lamp). it says that some will be ready and some won't. but remember, this is the antichrist timeline, so that means that this is a "christless" (ie. no enlightenment or pineal activation unless you meet the meet the minimum bad-feeling requirements)

---

OK, back to epic of gilgamesh... the other thing that I noticed too in when kyle was relaying the story is that gilgamesh (the bridegroom) has to resist sleep for 6 days and 7 nights. the 6 days thing is really important too as it's the same length of time that enkidu was with the harlot.

this whole story reminds me so much of the "hero twins" trope. the hero twins in this story are enkidu and gilgamesh. the hero twins are also the alpha and omega (gilgamesh identifies himself as this in the beginning of the epic) and it's where I got the inspiration for the name "leapfrogging-time-pickles" as it's the same formula.

another connection to that is that in oahspe osiris divides himself into the god of the earth (enki) and lord of the heavan (enlil). anubis is also there too. it's really weird and I haven't put it all together yet (still haven't read all of the translations yet either), but the major conclusion that I have here is that if enkidu (who has many of jesus' symbols) appears to be the hero twin that dies in this story, and gilgamesh is the bridegroom -- then I suppose enkidu is then the bridegroom and gilgamesh is the one that dies.

it's one of those weird hollywood-style stories where the gilgamesh is a total a-hole for the first part of the story but by the end I'm rooting for him and I want him to succeed. it's quite bizarre.

---

in conclusion, I think what I learned from writing about this one is that the bridegroom is one of the "hero twins" (enkidu after putting on clothes looks like a bridegroom) and these two seem to correspond to the changing of the ages.

I totally see the "bride" not as like physical girls or something like that but actually the part of the brain which lights up and can see (the eye). in this story (and others), it seems that there is a huge problem with the rejection of ishtar as the bride for the bridegroom.

in the jesus story, jesus (the bridgroom) is the stone which the builders rejected. in this story, although it appears that enlil (the bad-guy) is the cause for the world age change because he hates the humans (which gilgamesh is supposed to be a shepherd to), but in reality it appears to me instead that the flood and the change of age happened because gilgamesh rejected ishtar and she got pissed off

two hero twins, a good-guy (ea) and a bad-guy (enlil), and a psycho woman (ishtar).

I'll keep working on it. I keep seeing the idea and then it goes away, but the bride and bridegroom bit seems important to me. ugh. quitting for now.

### 2022-04-23 11:20 - feeling kinda dead

it's hard to explain how I feel, but it all started after I wrote @[picklepick](2022-04-18 13:43). because I don't have much external influnce, most of my reality is based on others' reactions, and I think that entry really deflated a lot of expectations or something.

I think that there was perhaps a really positive or optimistic outlook for my future (referring to nosebook), and it looks like that ruined it. there are two major things that I think could be happening:

1. everybody has been so fixed on cataclysm and crash, that nobody actually has any long-term plans. if I've planned only 10-20y ahead, thinking that is all that there is, then it's kind of a problem if the company or organisation doesn't actually plan to exist that long. this could be a good reason for a pretty good deflation. it could even be perceived by some that no cataclysm actually is a worse disaster.
2. there is a realisation that things can't be held away forever. like, for example -- how long will it take before other people figure out tesla's "world system" and wireless power becomes a thing? or, what about using the computer/phone with the mind? how long can all of that stuff be kept away from the public. 20y? 50y? 100y? do you really think that more than 100y will go by before tesla technology is mainstream? almost certainly this situation will assert itself into the hands of the energy sector. stuff like that.

you see, I think it's that second one that is really causing a problem, because imagine for a moment that joe rogan's dream about thousands of teslas starting to invent new things which will revolutionise the energy and transportation sectors (in his interview with musk). well, that's a pretty big problem, because that means very rapid population growth, and according to most that want to retain power and control, that's a pretty big problem. the last thing they would want is for us to actually have high technology.

so, I think that has put a pretty big dampner on a lot of their outlook into the future, and I feel it.

as a result, I've never felt more aimless and under motivated before in my life. I normally have something I want to do all the time, and would actually feel like I don't have enough time because there are so many things I want to do -- yet instead, I just feel like there isn't enough time to do anything, and I don't really have any desire to do anything in particular.

every time that I feel something that I want to do -- like I wanted to work again a little bit on the meaningful-chaos idea and it just feels like I don't really want to do it.

so, what ends up happening is I read something like oahspe and it feels to me like I'm wasting my time. I go to write down notes on venus and I start out feeling like I have the idea and I'll just write it out, but by the end, I feel like I've made things worse -- which is sort of fine, because the whole point of writing here is to abort the idea so I can get the evolution of the idea.

another reason why I may be feeling more negative feedback is becuse I'm not really writing very much good stuff. I'm kinda just brainbarfing into my notes instead of writing something coherent. I think people may be taking me seriously, when all that's happening is I'm just externalising a lot more of the chaos my brain experiences in the "figuring it out" process. so, if you're thinking that I've gone off of the deep end -- I have not; I've always been like this and it's how I figure stuff out -- just since this blahblog, I've been attempting to write stuff I'm still figuring out -- rather than only the stuff I've given previous thought to.

it's fine, as I'm pretty sure this is just a phase (or maybe not actually). I kinda like this sort of brainbarfing. it gives me more negative feedback, but I think it's totally fine.

---

the other thing I wanted to talk about is, in the previous entry, I said that only people meeting the minimum requirement of bad-feeling are elligable for expanded perception. the sense I had is that I was putting off a "holier than thou" vibe when I said that.

if I feel bad, then I will want something to make me feel better. this is normal. I used to use drugs all the time to feel better. I do agree that using conditions to feel better is not really a good solution, as it usually exacerbates the problem -- because rarely do people use the good-feeling of the condition to modify the underlying perception. instead, they just begin to rely more and more on the condition.

this will be most likely what happens to most. I noticed when reading oahspe that osiris got thothma to build the pyramid's foundation on wanting to preserve the physical body. it's almost certain that so many of these fallen-angels are all extremely conditional, needing certain conditions to survive. I think it's sorta like glasses -- they don't really "correct" the underlying reason for having out-of-focus vision -- just focus the image to make things clearer -- which just causes the person to rely on them more. in the same manner, I find it very unlikely that anyone will actually choose to have bad conditions and make the mental effort to change one's perception, when it's much easier to just get glasses.

I realise that this is the same subject as pharmaceuticals and addictions, and ... and ... and... it's human nature to look for the technology or conditions to temporarily treat the symptoms... (I think that's how to say it).

from my perspective, that problem is a good thing. I had this conversation with dad the other night and I explained that most people are motivated by physical, social, or emotional things .. the greatest of these is emotional things, because you have full control over how you feel. if I'm motivated socially, anyone can tell me what to do and how to feel, so I have to find people I trust, and ones who won't tell me to feel a way I don't want to feel -- etc. if I'm motivated by physical conditions, again this is problematic for a number of reasons (acquisition, tolerance, image, presentation, circumstance, etc.)

so really, the best thing that can happen to anyone is for them to enter into this state where they're completely motivated by how they want to feel rather than than other things.

it's only in that state that one begins to take control of how they want to feel, and that's a super good thing. once one takes a look at the alternatives, being "addicted" is actually the first steps on the path to freedom. I don't mean to say this the wrong way, but I will: I consider an "addict" more free than subordinate or a rich person. why? because they'll do anything to feel the way they want to feel; so you can't control them; only they can control them.

I really reconmmend that people do what they feel like doing rather than feeling socially or economically motivated or obligated.

### 2022-04-23 20:40 - obligation and addiction

I noticed when I woke up just now how similar those last two subjects are. imagine for a moment that you're a part of an organisation that has to maintain status quo (like a military or a government), because even if a certain number of the people think things could be done better, the organisation and the people are *obligated* to maintain status quo.

a good example of this may be certain parts of the government that must oppose human capacity for certain technologies because if those technologies were to be acquired, it would ruin their secrecy or security ...

for example, if there were a technology (like a quantum computer or something) that, even if it were to be very useful for us, but it made cracking passwords or reversing hashes a really easy thing, then they would have to prevent that technology from getting into our hands -- no matter how useful that technology could be. or, for example if the technology could be weaponised. like, imagine there were a way to direct the energy coming from the sun at something -- well, that would be 100% free energy in limitless supply (the sun would have to stop working, and that would be a far bigger problem than not having electricity and it won't happen) -- well, that too could easily be weaponised (like the vajra?) to destroy massive things by focusing the energy toward something. therefore, because unlimited electricty from the sun can be weaponised, then they can't allow us to have it.

those examples may sound silly, but I'm fairly certain that something similar to that already exists -- and it's sorta on top of that idea that I constructed my "decentralised socialism" prediction -- the decentralised part is because it needs to look as if the people have the power (ie. democracy), but really it's controlled by whomever has the most resources (the whales). the socialism part was because they'll have to quell our actual access to and capacity to understand these technologies, and since you can't really take something away, they'll have to offer the technology's product in a controlled way, so that we don't actually understand the technology (you know, so like some random guy can't modify his mobile phone to blow up the white house or something).

those people in those organisations are *obligated* to make actions from those social obligations -- meanwhile, an "addict" is driven by their need to feel the way that they want to feel. therefore an addict will give up on most circumstances in order to feel the way they want to feel.

I know because this is what happened to me. I see massive parallels for society in general (excluding the ones with those obligations) and my own experience. it came to a point where I simply couldn't get the conditions that I needed to feel good (MDMA, weed, smokes, etc) and so therefore because I was so emotionally motivated now without conditions to produce those emotions, I was *forced* to find a way to feel the way I wanted to feel without the conditions.

I don't want to say that this is the future for everyone on the planet, because I don't see it that way. instead I see it dividing into the two major groups: those with the economic capacity to purchase the conditions necessary to feel the way they want, and those that can do it perceptively.

the first group is capable of finding ways to satisfy their needs/wants and the second group *is* (I AM) the satisfaction of their needs/wants. in it's most simple form, it's just forcing people to separate into their most evoloved version of their desire (evolution-of-desire) -- and those that want to find the thing they want/need in their own capacity rather than looking for it externally will attract the conditions (this is the return to source/night-side/attraction phase), meanwhile others will use other conditions to construct the conditions they want/need (which is the emission/assertive/positive phase extending out from their source).

neither phase is superior to the other, but it's easy to see that the mindsets in action if looking at it like a hill. some people work so hard to climb the hill and expend so much effort, and those that they're passing on the trail up the hill seem to be passing them at a rapid speed (because they're walking down the hill, not up it). you could say that those walking up it are attracted to the summit and desire to make the effort, meanwhile those walking down the hill are attracted to the plain below and are just allowing theirselves to effortlessly go toward it.

the hill analogy is kind of a bad one, because it's kinda hard to imagine a hill that can appear uphill both ways or downhill both ways, but that's what perception is all about. we cling to our belief that we must expend effort to go toward the goal.

I'm reminded of a picture on facebook with a guy who walked up a hill with thorns on it. he's standing at the top with bloody bare feet a trophy and all those looking at him from the bottom don't see his bloody feet and sacrifice it took him to get to the top there. that image resonates with a lot of people -- and, those that believe it will walk uphill both ways because that's their perception.

it's pretty likely that the perspective of the guy on top of the hill was that, for him, it was actually a *downhill* slope filled with thorns and sharp plants, and he had no choice but to go that way. in fact, it may even be that in his perspective none of those thorns were actually thorns, but he presents his journey as a series of difficulties so people won't resent him anymore than they already do for getting to the top.

did he *want* to get to the top? did he *need* to get to the top? or, did he have a perspective of himself that effortlessly propelled him to the top, naturally?

only he could say for sure, but 100% guaranteed that all of those thorns there are his own perceptions.

### 2022-04-24 00:40 - snake trip

it's hard to describe how I feel after listening to the last ep of snake-bros #240. I felt desire to listen to it, meaning that there was interest to know my reaction to it. though the first part was especially relevant with the UFOs stuff, as I can't wait for the next installment with laura pinning marty to give more elaborated answers -- as that's going to be pretty cool. I also felt like the conclusion to that email was also very relevant in that there could be endless discussion on the subject, but they/we simply don't have the capacity yet to fully understand the many phenomenons[^1].

what I mean is that there also felt like it felt kind of silly to continue to discuss the phenomena if there's no way to actually directly experience it and explore it deeper.

this is my own view on drugs. when I first found out that I was stuck in nosebook, I was very sad because I had only begun to explore this area of the mind. I figured out how to expand my vision and it seemed to me to be infinite, so I (of course) wanted to explore it. however, knowing that nosebook is actively preventing me from experiencing it (hang on, this ties in to what I'm going to say next about the trip) made me feel very sad because I really believed that I wouldn't ever get to actually explore this astral world (the visual part of it).

according to the sirians, only the first 3/7th of the conceptual world (the concrete mind) has visual parts to it and this is what interfaces with the imagination. I was wanting to see it in order to believe (explore) it. over time, I realised that I didn't need to see the conceptual world to believe it. I didn't really need the manifestation of being able to see the angels, demons, fey, etc, to expand my interaction with this world.

there was another part in that episode about "not looking back" which I thought the part about addiction is really relevant to that, and it reminds me of a tick episode where he fights the proto clown and gets hit into outer space and goes on a journey inside of his mind. the part about self-realisation was the part where he has to not look (just believe) and then step out into the great abyss. this imagery is also in "most holy trinisophia" as well, and in the temptation was to have the rich guy guide him -- which was a false guide.

---

what I'm trying to say is that the aspect of looking (back or forward) is the utilisation of sensory input to determine your direction: inotherwords, you go toward what you're tuned to -- so, if you want to go toward physical, don't look back to the conceptual world and if you want to go to the conceptual, don't look back to the physicsal.

in a lot of ways, I've essentiall chosen the conceptual path, and so it's kind of like a trecherous path for me to "look back" or try and do things the old way. for example, after I had the brain haemorrhage (or these people involved with these UFO/fey/spirital experiences), and I was forever changed. I simply couldn't go back to doing things the way I used to do them. effort to try and do so, were met with difficulty. the way that I experience it, is that each "layer" seems to be counter-rotating from the previous[^2], so the conceptual way of doing will "against the grain" of the previous physical way of doing things.

yesterday I wrote @[blahblog](2022-04-23 11:20) to explain this idea, but it feels like I'm in the bermuda triangle and all of my senses are completely out of sorts (so I gatta rely on the instruments rather than my physical senses). anyway, you could imagine this is kinda what death[^3] feels like too, and it takes a while to orient oneself either back into the physical where effort is necessary or up into the conceptual where everything is effortless and thoughts become reality instananeously.

therefore, for me this entire situation feels entirely "against the grain" for me, as I'm becoming a conceptual being. everything works differently and I have to tune to what I want to experience. I can't really "look back" and try to go back to the old way of doing things.

---

it's hard to explain this feeling, because there's a definite part of me that wants to go and hang out with marty and stuff and talk about all of this, but the reality is -- well, there are two: first, nosebook cannot allow it to happen because I seem to bring up a lot of taboo topics, and it would be very unwanted for that to happen. I don't really mind that they want to try and hold all of this such a secret, as I believe the whole goal is *not* for me to come and try to be a saviour to anyone -- but instead that some sort of separation will happen instead (temporal as in split or physical as in pluto) which will allow them to keep their secret going[^5]. the whole point, is for them to keep their charade going for a long time, and they can't have a reckless hotshot (me) roll through and blow it. if their secrets are blown, then they don't have any obligation anymore to maintain business-as-usual. the other reality that's happening is that I simply don't mind that they want to hold off until the very last second when they have to make the separation. I'm not doing this for any reason other than for my own expansion and capacity to tune to what I want. I don't yet feel like I'm very good at that. when I'm good at it, then you'll know (or maybe not because the separation has happened and they've covered it up).

I just don't really think it's a problem, and actally because the-problem-is-the-solution, I'm totally going to the very bitter end. I *want* them to get as much capacity that they can get to hold people back, because the better the capacity they have the more people have to actually find their own way. it's kinda messed up, I know. anyway, I've always maintained that I'm just the pre-game show. later, there will be others. who are the others? you are. anyone that wants to be, is. that's the point. nobody else is going to "save" you. only you can save you by tuning to what you want and then actually believing it[^4]. that's all I'm doing. I'll get there eventually, and it'll be awesome.

[1]: I think it's plural. I always get these confused -- when to use phenomena and phenomenon. this sentence is a problem because it can be read as singular or plural, "understand the [many phenomena | phenomena]". I've got no idea cause it looks both singlular and plural to me so how do I know which tense to use? anyway...

[2]: upon writing this, I don't know why it feels that way to me. I would have guessed that the imaginary layer is counter-rotating, but perhaps, the imagination is just the turbulant inbetween layer (convergence line) between two systems (like a storm front where more lightning strikes happen between two pressure systems)

[3]: I mean the state further than the astral. I define the astral as the state where visuals become reality really quickly. there's a part in dtp where he sees lolix and their bloody baby.. there. there's a transition from the earth based reality that everyone believes in, to things you believe in (traumas, emotions) manifesting into visuals (like lolix and the baby) and then finally devachan where nearly all resistance is released. though it feels natural in devachan that everything should just appear as its conceptualised, it takes a little bit of time to get used to that when coming from a physical perspective -- and likewise, it takes a child a little while to realise that everything he/she sees is not "real" (ie. the thing everyone else believes is "real" too).

[4]: it's kind of unfortunate that kids get here and they have all these adults around them that cannot see the reality that they see, so after some time, they come to "see" the reality that the majority sees, rather than the one they see. it takes years of practise to see the mainstream reality that everyone else sees, but they eventually "grow up" enough to finally see it.

[5]: the idea here being that they want to wait until the very last moment before making the split, ensuring that they've extracted the all that they can out of me.

### 2022-04-24 02:02 - lightning and concepts

another idea popped into head. at the end of snake-bros #240 I wasn't really listening because for whatever reason I wanted to play a game (I think this happens when there is conflict in my head and I want to ignore/distract myself from it), and they were talking about the electric universe and impact craters being perfectly circular, and the EU has the idea that perfectly circular ones are likely discharges. they got to talking about fulgerites(?) and I don't know much of what to say about that, but an "image" popped into my head...

this morning, I was considering what a frequency or wave actually is. there used be an ether, and this was a medium that carried waves through it -- but what exactly was it carrying, I didn't know. I then imagined a planet or a moon passing through a much less viscous water, and this would be the "ether". well, the "wave" now is just something going around in a circle. imagine a planet like earth and its moon traveling through water. the moon will be making "waves" in the water, and we would look at the periodicity of those waves and say it has a frequency. the force (voltage) of that wave would purturb the water so as to make it appear that at a point in a path, that wavefront would oscillate the water.

you could imagine an electon(?) is this moon spinning around the planet purturbing the water. the electron moon would be powered by it's central planet, but (that I know of), there is nothing that we identify with as the central position around which these electrons orbit around.

OK, now let's zoom out a bit and consider that one of those electrons has solidified enough to become a comet or a meteor. from what we know, these comets and meteors iteract with large gravitationaal masses like planets and stars. some of these meteors crash into the planet or the star (ie it attracted them too much), or they continue to oscillate around or between these bodies. when they crash into these planets/stars, we can consider that "resistance" and that gets converted to thermal energy (heat).

OK, now let's go somewhere else -- and imagine neurons and the electrical signals that pass between them. I can imagine that what is passing between these neurons is actually a "concept" and those concepts have a number of electrons orbiting around them, their collective magnitude is their "voltage" or potential. I can think of this like a meteor. it has all of this angular momentum (potential energy) stored up, and when it gets close enough to the planet or neuron that the breakdown voltage has been surpassed, a discharge will happen.

I imagine then that the concept will then be altered by the interaction with the planet/neuron and so therefore will be stripped of it's electrons/moons and or gain some more in different orbits, causing a change in vibration which will then do something ... I don't know. 

---

the interesting thing about that image is that you could see how the perturbations of the water in which this concept and its moons are traveling would be perceived by us as "magnetism" and the oscillation of these waves would attract or repel thing depending on the other things coherence with its vibration.

if looking at sand floating in ocean water, it mostly oscillates with the waves, not really traveling too far -- and this could be seen as the electron travel speed.

the other thing this explains is why coils make magnetism, as current flowing through it purturbs the ether in such a way that it attracts other similarly orbiting metals. the magnetic/paramagnetic/diamagnetic property of any element is just the orbits of its "electrons", and similarly orbiting electrons attract eachother.

so, what's the ether made out of? is it even tinier concepts and orbiting electrons? like a fractal?

### 2022-04-24 17:19 - time snakes

I just listened to snake-bros #007 and in it kyle mentions the effortless power idea (can't remember the martial arts guy's name). he also mentioned (this was the earlier version of) the idea of being able to be aware of a period of time. he related it in one of the later episodes as being aware of like a 5 minute span of time called now, and I liked the idea so much but like russ said, "how would you even experience that?" and at that time I could begin to feel it, but I was caught up with the span of time part.

it wasn't until this listen that I figured out how to experience it. I'm writing it out here -- just in case someone may find this idea as invigourating as I do.

I'm looking at a figure I drew on paper on my desk where I have the sine wave of two octaves on top of each other, and in the part where the waves are nearby, because one wave is twice the size, they are more nearby to each other.

I have postulated that these are the "zero-points" where two seemingly opposite direction interzctions where one is double the speed of the other can be viewed as essentially the same "moment in time". that's the first part.

the next part is how I look at a concept. so imagine how it is that I write these messages (well, not all of them, because I've been blabing a lot lately) -- and essentially, I am looking at a mass of different particles, and these can be perceived as data or concepts -- and they each are orbiting (spinning) at thier own speed (much like how I described the electrons spinning around the concept in the previous entry). so just imagine this mass of spinning sub-concepts and supporting data as the thing that I want to write or to say...

what I do is I perceive one point, in the mass, and then a lot of times I'm trying to see how to get from one point to another point, and this makes a trajectory through the mass of vibrating particles. it looks a lot like lightning passing in a squigly or jagged route through space (it's not straight), and that's because so many of the spinning particles are affecting it's trajectory from starting point to destination.

if I can't find the path from one point to another, I add more concepts into the mass until I have a more complete picture with a suitable route. I try to add these concepts in "completed" form (ie. without resistance -- just the pure concept).

when I explain the concept to one person, that is, translate it, it always comes out a little different for each person, because I add the other person's perception (the way I feel them) into the mass, and that adds more spinning "electrons" and so therefore affects the  trajectory of my traversal of the subconcepts (the translation) from starting point to destination.

this is how the brain interprets linear time, and I have to take this 5d perspective where I see the concept from all angles at once and convert it into something coherent and linear that can be understood (like I'm doing now).

so, now imagine that the other person that I'm talking to, is kind of analogous to all the vibration present in the situation I'm in. like the retrocusality thing, I *feel* the thing before "I" (my physical senses) translate it into something that has happened.

---

it's so easy to want to transform it into a linear progression from one point to another because that translation, like a juicy soap gives you all the dirty details in the minute-to-minute breakdown, just like writing this is much more invigourating (lol) than just feeling the concept. I love writing these because I enjoy listening to myself translate the idea -- (and this is important) -- because my brain enjoys learning from what I already know. just because I know something doesn't mean my brain has experienced it. this is the immense pleasure I get from translating the concept into text.

so that really is the thing. in order to experience this sort of consciousness of a "span" of time (it would actually be perceived more like a concept where it's interacting and constantly trasnforming with everything around it in the "now". to explain this, when I see a concept, I see it like I see it now, but then later *I* change (so does the conceept interacting and attracting similar concepts), and so I see the concept later as a transformed/evolved verson of itself, or with "these eyes" because my own perception has changed... so I still see the concept and can see it's "future" and "past" interactions with itself in relation to me, but I'm still perceiving it now, and like any living thing, it's constantly transforming and evolving.

---

that doesn't sound as cool as what kyle was transmitting though, so I would say that's kind of like the "pure" (counter-rotating) version of the experience of time, but I have an intermediate solution that is why I wrote this, because I want to figure out how to "collapse the wave function" and traverse a path linearly while still remaining conscious of the whole. I'm not super duper good at this completely, but you see me doing it here where I maintain interaction with the concept and can alter my linear trajectory if I don't like the feel of it.

I can't really explain very well, but I'm sure for everyone else they will just see my linear traversal through time, but I'm beginning to have this idea that I can go back and seemingly "alter" my passage through time. the best way I can describe this is .. say something to someone that they will take the wrong way, or wait until someone takes something you say the wrong way (or misunderstands you), and give little importance to that, and instead alter the feeling that *you* felt in that interaction so that it felt like they understood instead of that they misunderstood, and notice how all of a sudden they seem to now understand you. well, you just switched "timelines". it's like that.

so the idea is to enjoy the linear progression through time, but have the ability to modify the "past" (or is it the present in the "span of now"?) to be the timeline that you want to experience.

now, the next part is to learn how to "complete" all of reality such that it would not bother you to even go back into another "place" -- like what if you missed the bus and instead felt yourself at the bus or at home, or wherever you wanted to go? in your perception, you got there traversing through a lot of (completed) concepts that didn't have a whole lot of significance, and so therefore you weren't held into a different version of now because of them.

I'm really going to have to find a better way to explain it. all I can say is, you won't notice much difference when I figure it out. I'll appear much the same, just have more and more increased "good timing" and it'll appear like things start getting easier and easier.

that's all for now... I don't have it yet, and I'm still quite a ways off, but having realised a way of how it could work means that now I can go do it. easy :)

anyway, I'm sure that this idea will be the first of many because ever since the "retrocausality" experiments, I've really been fascinated by this. you'll see ... I hope. I really want to find a way to first get it, and then demonstrate how effortless it all is.

also, of note, when listening to it, I also had a strange desire to meet that martial arts dude. hopefully one day I will; that'd be cool.

cheers. I have a lot to think about more now!! so awesome!!
