# turtle and phoenix

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/vVvGwzZvQhw)

never heard of this poem, but as tim is talking I'm getting a lot of ideas. I still have yet to read the poem, so these are initial impressions.

- the birds are phoenix (a symbol of reurrection) and also the turtle dove
  - immediately, this reminds me of jeortau (dove) and mars (phoenix).
    - I imagine that this poem has something to do with 1-2-7, so the missing part here is the desire symbolism.
    - further on this, the union of the two birds produce something that transcends reason (3rd ray)
      - so again, this poem reminds me of the transition from the 1st ray triad (1-2-3) to the reverse 1st ray triad (1-2-7)
      - in the original 1st ray triad, the 2nd ray (jeortau) is the phoenix
        - later on, as defined by the baptism of jesus, when jesus receives the holy spirit, it appears as a dove coming down and entering
        - because of various things that I've read, jesus is constantly associated with elijah, which I associate with mars, a 7th ray.
        - combine mars (7) with the "father"/anatau (1) and you have the 1-7 alpha and omega porspectives in the same body.
        - the only thing remaining now, is the 2nd ray (dove symbol), and a rebirthing (phoenix).
      - therefore, in the reverse 1st ray triad (1-2-7), the symbol is no longer the phoenix, but the dove -- the promise after the destruction.

- poem is divided into 3x22 line segments, with one concluding line.
  - it may be possible that the sections refer directly to the different aspects of the new (1-2-7) triad, as from the 1-2-3 perspective, this is the descent into reason and logic (thinking analytically - aryan vs atlatian)
  - however, once descended into pure physicality (materialism) and reason, now things reverse, and so it's perceived from the 1-2-7 perspective in which we're now heading back toward desire.
  - notice that, from the 1-2-3 perspective, desire appears as purpose or willpower (emissive), but from the 1-2-7 perspective, it now appears more as something very attractive.

- the birds don't produce any offspring, reminding us of the first 17 sonnets where the fair youth (adonis?) is being advised to produce offspring


### personal notes

as a general thing that I want to note here, I'd like to mention that there are three major characters that show up for me all the time. first is mars (the young stallion/fair youth, etc.), then there is venus (black/ham/dark is her colour, and she has echos in every major female role like gertrude/ophelia) kinda shapeshifting between them all, and then finally the older father type (adonis/saturn/vulcan). these get conflated, as all three of them take on different roles.

---

the other thing I'd like to note here is that as tim is talking about the birds having a full and complete death (no resurrection), complete without having any offspring, this is really the "end" for this dynamic pair, I get these pictures showing up in my head, which I'm not so sure how to describe.

it reminds me of an event that happened the other day when I was watching the honey bees going around from flower to flower, they appearerd to me as very fragile -- which is sorta true; in comparison to the bees, a wasp does not at all look fragile: it has a sleek design and I know from experience that unless I really destroy their bodies irreparably, they're quite able to recover from a good whack and get back even to flying around. they're quite durable. anyway, as I was watching these bees buzz around and go from flower to flower (from vagina to vagina), I noticed this other one that was going around. he was all black with yellow stripes (opposite colour scheme of a yellow-jacket or wasp) and he was going around as well.

it's important to note that these were sage(?) bushes with purple flowers that appear in somethming of a fibonacci sequence around the stem as the plant ascends (the leaves are at the bottom). the plant itself is quite a *weed* in nature and will grow pretty well, even without too much water. I'll consider it an advanced weed. it's also important to note that its flowers are not like the normal flowers that a plant has, where they appear at the top of the stem. as the plant reaches new heights, (has sufficient leaves nutrients on the bottom) little purple cylinders "pop" out from the stem, and then from out of these cylinders pops a tiny purple flower. the cylendars are already the seeds that will grow up to be new bushes, but I believe the function of the flower is to get a foreign (diverse) input as the bees reach for the pollen inside there (this may also increase fertility or gene mixing, not sure). if a mushroom or a normal flower has a single stage deployment where the seeds are inside of the flower/cap, this one appears a bit different. very interesting.

anyway, I'm watching this black bee/wasp go around and his behaviour was pretty notable, because he didn't care so much for the (matured) flowers coming out of the seeds, but was much more interested in the seeds themselves. I couldn't really see what he was doing to the seeds because my eyesight was especially poor that day, but I noticed a few things that made him very different from the bees:

1. if a bee lands on a branch that another bee is aready on, the first bee will fly off as soon as the other one lands. they tend not to occupy the same branch and remain in motion. this black one was not on the same frequency as the bees, and would often times occupy the same branch as the bees, and he even had a few near collisions with the bees.
2. the bees are never seen on the ground, but this black one spent quite a lot of time on the ground where many many seeds had already fallen. not sure what he was doing exactly, but he was definitely doing something to/with the seeds down on the ground (seeds on the ground lose a lot of their colour and appear a very yellow-greyish violet now).
3. I noticed a bit of roof shingle on the ground next to him and went to pick it up. he seemed a bit upset that I was disturbing things in his environment, but didn't really attack me. later, I tried to put my finger down so he could climb on top of it, but he seemed very uninterested in me. he maintained a dilligent business that the bees have for the flowers, but with the seeds. he did not want any interruptions to his work on the seeds.

I found all of this fascinating, and while I was watching this, a similar image popped into my head that did when tim was explaining that the phoenix and dove do not make any natural offspring and so they do appear to finally die out... the image in both of these cases contatained the quality that the flowers represented mature reproductive capable vaginas, in that they can produce offspring genetically, but the seeds -- let's just say that these do not produce plants because they haven't been pollenated properly. the idea here is that the black bee, because he is interacting with young seeds that do not have a flower or old seeds that have already fallen, this would not produce cross-pollenated offspring like the bees were helping the other seeds to do.

the conclusion that I came to in that moment is that I'm sorta similar to the black one in that I'm a sort of hybrid between the wasp and the bee. this is interesting symbolism, because I associate the editors of jesus' story to be the "flavian touch". titus flavius vespasianus (vespasian) is the roman emperor that I (and doug) believe is responsible for many of the edits done to the gospels and also the originator of the pen name "josephus". the important part here is the wasp's assoication with the roman emperor reigning around 69 AD (interestingly he also died at age 69), and that vespa is wasp in spanish/latin. the flavian dynasty even came to an end on (dates are important to these guys) 18 (3x6) of september (9) of 96 (69 backwards).

the wasp is the roman attribute, and the bee is something else. there's an interesting line at the end of hamlet where horatio (horatio is a funny name because it reminds me "of time" (saturn) or "of the hour"), and as hamlet is dying, horatio wants to drink the poison too, saying, "I am more an antique roman than a dane". the romans, I make the case are the INFECTED ONES (or fallen-angels) and these guys infiltrate high societies by moving their consciousness into bodies of young children or newborns of the upper nobility class, allowing them to be born into and become rightful heirs to positions of power in these high societies. they don't create the high society, they just try and take over powerful positions of those socities. in general, the red ones are a mixed bag, but it seems that they have a strong desire to have good conditions. these red ones (often red cross or red rose in centre of white) achieve these feats of technology because have access to expanded perception and imaginary capacities. through these "esoteric" practises and secret rituals. they seem to originate mostly from atlantis (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/BqmgUzOpb84?t=916)). dane refers to the tribe of dan, which is symbolised by the serpent and the colour red (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/BqmgUzOpb84?t=1008)). hamlet seems to be a play all about that.

I'll get to the conclusion in a second, but I'd like to make the point that in the tragedy of hamlet, ham (black) is mentioned, so is norway and also japheth, which is mostly taken to be the king in northern palestine (samaria) that sacrificed his daughter because he was a man of his word (hamlet struggles to follow through with what he says he'll do, and adonis also struggles with this). claudius clearly represents one of these inpleasant infiltratrators that userps the kingdom. note that elizabeth was the last of the tudor (black madonna) dynasty, and she had no heirs. instead, I believe that devere moved this expanded form of perception off into the secret societies (rosicurcians and the builders guilds -- rosencrantz and guildenstern)... OK, ending the rabbit trail.

back to my conclusion: I saw myself as that black wasp/bee that was not interested in pollenating mature flowers (genetic heirs), but instead, I'm concerning myself with something that produces no issue, which is messing with the unpollenated seeds which will likely not grow up. my job here is not to leave behind a genetic legacy or biological bloodline or whatever, but instead to plant conceptual seeds, which will eventually grow up differently. I do that by having the form of the wasp (romans, claudius) and just going about my own way. no need for me to leave behind any physical legacy, to instead leave behind a legacy of desire. things have reversed their polarity now. instead of using reason and going toward physicality, now I'm leaving behind the manifestation that leaves the most to be desired (a tragedy -- which is a physical disaster, but produces much desire instead). it's kinda difficult to put this into words, honestly. hopefully the connections are clear enough to see.

the whole point is to kill the phoenix and the turtle (the ascending and decending aspects of the 2nd ray in the 1st ray triad), so that we're no longer fixated on the physical but instead on the what it is that each person *individually* wants/desires. the king/group structure's time has now passed (which is why horatio (of time/saturn) has the ending explanation and finally explains to the (white?) outside of the masses wtf is going on) and fortenbro (norway, the new nordic power structure) takes over the "kingdom". it looks like a tragedy, but it's really the perfect setup for individuality and art to emerge, which is why I think the troubadours/players take on the new narration position. you see, from now on, it's all about the individual and what the individual wants/desires...

### "The Phoenix and Turtle"

Let the bird of loudest lay
On the sole Arabian tree
Herald sad and trumpet be,
To whose sound chaste wings obey.

But thou shrieking harbinger,
Foul precurrer of the fiend,
Augur of the fever's end,
To this troop come thou not near.

From this session interdict
Every fowl of tyrant wing,
Save the eagle, feathered king;
Keep the obsequy so strict.

Let the priest in surplice white,
That defunctive music can,
Be the death-divining swan,
Lest the requiem lack his right.

And thou treble-dated crow,
That thy sable gender mak'st
With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st,
'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.

Here the anthem doth commence:
Love and constancy is dead,
Phoenix and the turtle fled
In a mutual flame from hence.

So they loved, as love in twain
Had the essence but in one,
Two distincts, division none;
Number there in love was slain.

Hearts remote yet not asunder,
Distance and no space was seen
'Twixt this turtle and his queen;
But in them it were a wonder.

So between them love did shine
That the turtle saw his right
Flaming in the phoenix' sight;
Either was the other's mine.

Property was thus appalled
That the self was not the same;
Single nature's double name
Neither two nor one was called.

Reason, in itself confounded,
Saw division grow together,
To themselves yet either neither,
Simple were so well compounded

That it cried, "How true a twain
Seemeth this concordant one!
Love hath reason, Reason none,
If what parts can so remain,"

Whereupon it made this threne
To the phoenix and the dove,
Co-supremes and stars of love,
As chorus to their tragic scene.


Threnos


Beauty, truth, and rarity,
Grace in all simplicity,
Here enclosed, in cinders lie.

Death is now the phoenix' nest,
And the turtle's loyal breast
To eternity doth rest,

Leaving no posterity;
'Twas not their infirmity,
It was married chastity.

Truth may seem, but cannot be;
Beauty brag, but 'tis not she;
Truth and beauty buried be.

To this urn let those repair
That are either true or fair;
For these dead birds sigh a prayer.

### threnos

I noticed this word stuck out at me. when I first saw it, I noticed it is "three" and "nos" ("we" - first person plural in spanish/latin). nos is also in the sense of gnosis or gnostic, in that it means knowledge: sophia. I thought about it as "knowledge of threes" -- which is interesting because that's also something that tesla explains is pretty important (importance of 3-6-9) and I myself carry on endlessly about these "triads" (of an emitter ground and female, or two females of opposite types and a ground). after that line, as if to demonstrate this the final part of the poem has triads (beauty, truth, rarity) instead of dualities (love and reason, love and constancy).

the whole poem is a move from 2 to 3. I also see a lot of 4's and 5's though, but for example the 4's are born out of the 2's and 5's are born out of the structure itself.

to illustrate, notice how in the first 20 (5x4) lines, it's talking about the alpha omega character of these birds (eagle and crow). harbinger of sadness, ending of tyrants and priests, and then on the 6th paragraph, the thing comences. I see the eagle as the opposite of the phoenix, and the crow/swan as the opposite of the turtledove (the swan is death-divining and the crow gives and takes breath). they're literally identified as the priests and the kings/tyrants. the turtle divides into two (crow and swan).

the next thing to note is that they become "either neither": "any one" or "no one", so they're apart but together, yet while they're together, they're one, but also two, yet also three. they're all or nothing at the same time, yet out of that emerges the three.

first 20 (5x4) lines: alpha/omega (beginning and end of priests and kings)
4 lines: comence the beginning of the transition into three
7-13(x4) lines: explains they are 2, 1, and 0 -- therefore, they are three.
threenos: we are knowledge of the threes.
final 5x3 lines: here are three things that are all dead (0)

I would like to mention too that because they are "no one" but at the same time they are "any one" (either or neither), this is likely referring to the general population (anyone), and what makes them now become "any one" is because of the things that are now dead.

### death of beauty, truth, and rarity

this line makes perfect sense to me looking at the society that we live in today, especially in the context of nosebook. it's easy to see that "truth" is dead (narrative is not truth). rarity is pretty easy to see when considering the internet nowadays, as unlimited access to knowledge has made rarity of information a thing of the past. now, if you consider the idea of looking for a partner, and what you're looking for is something "rare" (like a knight in shining armour, or a super chivalrous noble(wo)man) to sweep you off of your feet, those are rare, but we're entereing a time where these sorts of things are losing their attractive qualities.

to explain why I think rarity dies, is because of the death of beauty and truth. if everyone is very beautiful, there is no longer any single most beautiful person that is considerably more attractive than the rest. we see this already today where there are soo manyyy beautiful people nowadays, it's hard to say that beautiful people are rare anymore. beauty is quite common.

truth is another interesting thing to see die. to get an insight into shakespere's mind on this I refer to hamlet, where rosencrantz, guildenstern, and hamlet talk in unison about the future (doomsday), claiming that the world has grown honest, and that "every one" is happy, but "no one" is overly happy. comparing this fortune where overhappy is the top of her head, and unhappy would by thte souls of her shoes, but instead they're around her waist, in the middle of her favours -- in her secret parts. she claims she is a strumpet, which reminds me strongly of the first paragraph:

    Let the bird of loudest lay
    On the sole Arabian tree
    Herald sad and trumpet be,
    To whose sound chaste wings obey.

the bird of loudest lay sounds very sexual to me. the strumpet fortune (whore of babylon) is making everyone happy, but not overly happy (she's a loud lay), which causes "chaste wings" to obey her -- which sounds to me like if a loud lay is causing chaste wings to obey, this sounds like a sexual revolution to me.

so, along with the world becoming "honest" hamlet is proposing that there will also be a future sexual revolution at the same time. long gone are the days where someone of beauty and rarity comes to you and tells you the truth. all of this happiness (but not overly happy), souds a lot to me like good-enoughness.

you have to see that the 2nd ray in descending down into the physical, is a "saviour" figure, and so they will look around in the world and see all of the things that are *not* good enough and try to improve/save those things (because you're moving away from desire), but on the ascent, all things are now desirable, and so everything is now desirable. all truth becomes "good enough" cause it's just a narrative anyway, so whatever man, beauty is everywhere and so all things desirable are easily perceived now, meaning that rarity of something desirable is no longer a thing. beauty and truth are now in the eye of the beholder, and now everything is moving on the path of becoming more and more "good enough" rathar than less and less "good enough".

I hope I explained the seeming contradiction between truth and beauty being dead, but at the same time thteir death has now made it possible for everyone to be true (grown honest) and fair. the connecting idea is the rarity. if what you want/desire is no longer rare and what you wanted is truth, then, "truth" is now "every one" but because truth requires a opposite falsehood to exist, "truth" no longer exists "no one" has truth anymore.

another try: if everyone has $100 and everything costs more than $100, nobody has enough (rarity/scarcity exists). however if everything now costs, $1, then with $100 everybody now has enough (abundance exists). nothing really changed, other than the market is flooded with desirable (good enough) things. reason doesn't explain this very well. it seems paradoxical, but it's basic economics.

### 2023-03-06 18:35 - antoher look at the death of beauty and truth

in the video, tim mentions that this poem has feelings of john keats' "ode to a grecian urn". when I made these notes a while back, I hadn't read keats before. now, [after having figured him out](/poeticc-observvrence.md#2023-03-02-1359---poetry-vs-writing), tim's comment makes A LOT more sense :) I totally see the connection now, and there's another aspect I hadn't put into the framework of the planet's vibrational range moving beyond physical (7th) frequcies and into esoteric/conceptual (5th ray) frequencies -- something the sirian guide mentioned, but I hadn't really considered it [until this morning](/the-manifestation.md#2023-03-06-0937---the-two-worldsearths), where I talked about how this planet wants to move up to 5th ray, meaning all of the physical stuff we know and love will dissolve and instead become a more vapour-like substance of dreams. I don't really want to live in a world of dreams, so I suggested that we find a way to make a second world (at first), then another earth, where 7th ray people (like myself) can exist and thrive.

upon watching tim's video again today and reading "ode to a grecian urn" (copied below), I'd like to take another look at the death of beauty and truth:

                  ODE ON A GRECIAN URN

                            I
    Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,
      Thou foster-child of Silence and slow Time,
    Sylvan historian, who canst thus express
      A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme :
    What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape
      Of deities or mortals, 'or of both,
        In Tempe or the dales of Arcady ?
      What men or gods are these ? what maidens loth ?
    What mad pursuit ?  What struggle to escape ?
        What pipes and timbrels ?  What wild ecstacy ?

                          II
    Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
      Are sweeter ; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on ;
    Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd
      Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone :
    Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave
      Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare ;
        Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,
    Though winning near the goal — yet, do not grieve ;
        She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,
      For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair !

                         III
    Ah, happy, happy boughs ! that cannot shed
      Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu ;
    And, happy melodist, unwearied,
      For ever piping songs for ever new ;
    More happy love ! more happy, happy love !
      For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd.
        For ever panting, and for ever young ;
    All breathing human passion far above,
      That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,
        A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.

                            IV
    Who are these coming to the sacrifice ?
      To what green altar, O mysterious priest,
    Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies.
      And all her silken flanks with garlands drest ?
    What little town by river or sea shore.
      Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel.
        Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn ?
    And, little town, thy streets for evermore
      Will silent be ; and not a soul to tell
        Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.

                              V
    O Attic shade !  Fair attitude !  with brede
      Of marble men and maidens overwrought,
    With forest branches and the trodden weed ;
      Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought
    As doth eternity : Cold Pastoral !
      When old age shall this generation waste,
        Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe
      Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,
    'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,' — that is all
        Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

the mental image tmat this poem evokes for me is the time between the creation of the second earth and the time we're in now (especially with the Attic shade, and "marble men and maidens overwrought"), is that the side of the earth that is facing the sun, has essentially eternal spring and is a very magnificent place to be, and all that great stuff, but the problem with it is this: it's a dream world.

to understand why this is the death of beauty and truth (the grecian urn/sacrifice) is because the astral is entirely imaginary. I like the physical plane because beauty is a reflection of the way that you conceptualise your reality. people with a voracious appetite for reality (and concepts which make them feel unstoppable) tend to be very attractive people. the 7th ray physical reality is entirely a reflection of the conceptual. however, like with dreams and the imagination -- anything can look good. now, beauty (which is q reflection of a concept into physical) no longer has to be a reflection -- but can be covered over with a pretty image.

truth is the same problem: if I have a concept, the concept itself *is*, so therefore it's "true" or "truth" -- and it can be felt plainly. so, when a person feels (for example) old, their physical body will start to look old; however, in the astral I can feel old, but disguise that feeling by making a pretty shape for myself. I no longer must be a reflection, and so therefore, the "truth" of something no longer catches up with it over time (like it does in the physical).

I personally don't want to be a part of such an imaginary world, and have no interest in taking part in it. I don't mind that others love the idea of narrating their way through their dream realityies, but I like real reflections of concepts, so I'll be finding a way to continue to live and exist in a physical format.

I did also find it interesting that the poem is all about going from 2 to 3 -- which is exactly what the whole pen-rose idea is all about, and what I believe is the catalyst of such a brave new world.

it's also very interesting to me how these poet-apes are kind of like mind viruses to those that want to learn how to tell good stories. like a masque is to the king, shakespere is to the storytellers of the modern age: the depth/power of perception that the king has, in conjunction with his ability to see symbols, motions and colours, tells a symbolic story that is not immediately apparent, but yet is also still attractive -- kind of like an ugly or grotesque tragedy that is compelling and sexy.

### 2023-03-08 14:41 - I just want to write :: turtle and phoenix having a conversation

I decided that I want to try and focus my mind into more concrete things that I can relate to physically. so, here we go...

the turtle and the phoenix reprents for me a transition, not, a death. I say death because it sounds like a funeral is happening. I suppose you could say that, because I'd be giving up my beloved 3d. I used to want to go the outside-in perspective, but I've come to really appreciate the inside-out perspective, -- which is very important, because outside in is when I can become multiple.

to explain, notice that when I look at myself from the outside-in persepective, I can now have more than one of me. I'm no longer confined to a single body. that's all great and stuff if I want to become multiple, but instead I've elected, that I'd rathar to be the 3d sorta reflection mirror when I decided I wanted to become a captain-of-3d. that for me was the ultimate decision to stay with the inside-out perspective, especially with the part of "I won't look back nor inside, only out."

I decided that as I add more and more physical interfaceses to my body, I'll start to gain more and more perspectives of the whole thing -- a sort of holographic sort of *invisible* reality where I exist inside of my "physical" world, but also, I'll be a lot of places eslewhere at the same time. I've noticed that in physical it's near to impossible for me to have anything more than one logical/language thing going on at the same time, and my visual really slows it down, and even bringing it to a stop. I don't want to be visual, because I can't think and talk in the same time. this is the main reason why I don't like the idea of tons of hot girls or whatever is because I can't think logically at the same time because my visual is so stimulated.

anyway, I noticed just now that I'm also a sort of "end of history" as well, because as the final reflection, my concept of history is all that's left -- and as I've demonstrated, I don't have any real difficulties and think that there are an infininte number of ways to get to the present -- some more likely than others, but all of them are easily explainable by me.

what makes me a true end to hisotory, is that I don't think that there could ever be another part of history that brings me sadness. all of it is perfectly fine with me, and so essentially my non-resistance to whatever has happened in history is just not a big deal anymore -- not even a medium deal either. the tragedy of history is now a sort of limp feeling -- like zero aggitation, zero anticipation, zero desire (for it to be different), etc. since I'll slowly take over the "standard" perception at some point in time, as well is all a real nice thing.

instead of all of that, it looks like I'm going in for a bit of a phoenix action -- a sort of crash and burn. (so close!, right?) it looks like they want to move the dimensions around a bit so that the midpoint is now in 2nd ray and they're adding on a few artificial ones -- an idea that I wanted to do in 3d, because in 3d, it's easy to see that as soon as I get a system going where I'm interacting with a computer in a conceptual/emotional kind of way, the speed at which a new system emerges in a very little amount of time. I don't need to spend endless hours programming because I now have a feeling input/output to it. this idea could be tangential, but I'm just writing it ass I see it.

the other major thing to note here is that they want to move the physical layer over to astral -- essentially because they control the frequency and can control all of the imaginal things that manifest there (-- right not physical things though...), so then that means that we all experience the visual/imaginal that the "matrix" allows to be seen. I personally don't care about that, I just don't want to see other's images. I actually like being visually impaired, so long as I can continue to see none, I don't really care. I can imagine it to allow others to share visual spaces, so that only certain people can see certain visual things (don't care, lol). that gives them a lot of enforcement of stuff for them, but I feel kinda limited, because I want to interface with the physical (as in a true vibrational reflection of my concepts), instead, if we move up to astral, that means the physical is whatever they make it to be. going from a bedrock foundation of physical laws of the universe, I'm now interfacing with an ever transforming vibrational system, meaning -- if they do something wrong, they sink the whole ship (it'll be fine, right?).

so now, after accepting moving to the astral, I'm going to have to interact with a "physical" usiverse, which means that it's a pretty good risk, right? either they figure out how to do it all right (cause they're undoubtedly going to want to tweak things to their advantage, duh...) it's sorta annoying, but I'm actually not all that worried (lol). I'm sure it'll be fine :)

---

there are too many cool things about it which I do really like, so it's worth the risk. one of those is that we're going to have a much more multidimensional reality that's gonna feel real natural. it'll be quite the sensational experience, as everything is going to be notably more appetising-feeling (and also less) than before. like things will just feel disinteresting, and no longer wrong. that's the main advantage to this 2-axis system.

you know, I think this 2-axis system is kinda like DNA, becaue now there are two (and programatically more) spectrums in which to perceive the world. each person, I think will uniquely create their own. the reason why it's like DNA is because it has more than one axis: 0, 1, > 1. you see that the last term there (moaning multiplicity), I mean multiplicity of person, or of perception. in 3d, multiplicity of perception is easy. I'm quite aware of a lot of other things happening in my environment, and I realise therwe is as lot of nosebook edits to my environment already, it's still pretty reflective of my perception. I know that as nosebook continues to get control over it, they become my reality; they become a reflection of me. so in one way, I can put a bunch of doubts into your head, like I did above, is my kind of joke. I know that the final product is that they're going to become a 100% reflection of my perception, evntually. so whatever happens is is *always* going to be perfectly fine :)

let's see,  what's another cool thing? the feeling of going toward what you want will feel a lot more visceral, and though nosebook can modify it with the traversal of the pen-rose, it's going to create a lot more variety and diversity (at least in the long-run, but perhaps much sooner, even) -- not to mention, that I think we're going to use it to start going purposefully bad paths. sometimes it just feels kinda good to do a little bad-feeling (it's kinda a negative, ya know?), and I think it'd be cool to take paths that deliberately feel bad only for some part of the way, then after a certain point, it starts to feel good. maybe spruce it up by sprinkling some bad-feeling for a bit. I know I do :) it's fun you know....

OK, how about another cool thing about it? creative collaboration will be kinda fun because entry others you will be able to feel a certain way to others, kind of controlling how attracted you feel toward a thing. that seems good for some, and I mean in physical no, but for all you guys in astral, that means you can share visuals, and have a sort of feeling-zone where you already have a sort of feeling propensity to other things. OH, you know what that made me think about? who draws those conceptual lines between one thing and another is, when you connect to the phsysical (atoms) or the imaginal (ether), your brain (or at least mine does), draw its own conclusion of where the border of that concept (physical or otherwise) begins and ends. I define what aspects of them are them (and usually it's not a physical one), because the physical one is the visible one, and that's the one that prevents me from thinking logically -- so then I guess this system will make it easier for me even, to essentially tune you guys out visually. I really wasn't joking when I said that I don't really mind going blind, because everything I "see" is not actually "real" anyway.

as much as I'm a "reality guy", it's painfully obvious to me how little I interacct with "reality". I think it's a sort of ideal for me -- one that I like to pretend that's happening -- when I know it's really not. I don't have much that I can do about it, so remember, it's all a reflection of my percetion anyway. if I were stuck in the matrix like neo, and the matrix were manifesting my reality, my reality *is* their reality, so they're sort of subject to (under the power of), my relentlessly (vibrationally based) LOA form of perception. I know that it's a bit of a falsehood to think that I live in any "reality" other than my own, so what you can see is that their compromise of (and suspension of) LOA has accomplished is produce a new narrative reality, where even though our "reality" has been compromised, we're not "securing" it be building our own narrative. our narrative will be what we want it to be. checkmate :)

another cool thing? let's see... well, living in a visually narrated reality (something I don't want for myself) does have an interesting effect of learning to feel the way that you want to feel about it (feeling-purposefully) is because visually a person can be subjected to images that can create a sort of self-reinforcing "haunt" of that visual apparition (and the symbols -> conceepts that they represent). I like my "physical" world in which nosebook prevents all visual things from happening. so, even though it's a sort of matrix, at least I don't have to view others.

viewing others cannot allow me to be like how I am now, because of two reasons: when my visual brain is working, my logical is not. youtube has been so difficulty for me at times, because I can't really digest a concept if my visual brain is working. this is largely why I don't like to look at people in the eyes -- simply because I can't think at the same time because I'm too busy "seeing" them. it's not visual, but it completely shuts down all of my logical brain. this is essentially what nosebook wants -- and I think it would have produced a better result (but at what cost?), I wouldn't be able to critisise, notice, and talk about the flaws of nosebook. simply put, I'd see what *they* wanted me to see. I like seeing a reflection of what *I* see. that form of perception is extremely valuable to me, and even though they reduce, transform, and obliterate my vibrational inputs.

I can tell you that there are some organs (probably produced by the vibration of the DNA) that exist on higher and higher dimensions where you can receive those higher and higher frequency concepts -- so, at all of your expense, my inevitable desire to really understand and actually interact with those higher and higher frequncy concepts, they cause me to continually increase my spectrum. for me, this is amazing, but for you all, I imagine it's a bit of a "red knuckle" experience. fortuntatly having this system, will just make all of that irrelevant because we're putting our trust for reliable reality in the hands of someone that is ultimately a reflection of our perception. yes, I suppose it's possible they could prove to me a reality where they're so bad it it they ... we'll call this one wreckless-reality.

anyway -- even though every aspect of reality is completely artificial, I still suggest that one tends not to their appearance, but to their perception. appearance is outside-in, meanwhile perception is inside-out -- which reminds me of another reason that I want to stay physical which is that I value my percetion of myself more than my physical aspect of myself, and it's just really an enormous problem not to be able to think while my visual brain isn't working. however that, there's been an interesting aspect to this, which is that I've grown novel interfaces to reality which I can't describe in physical terms -- and that's because they're not physical. I doubt there's even a vibration on earth that shows up physically. I seemingly have, either another presence on another planet, or perhaps a celestial body

the celestial perspective, which is the capacity to receive signals from signal sources that are not directly connected to nosebook -- is good news, because imagine the futility of trying to get jupiter to behave like you want him to. laughable, if you ask me. imagine for a moment that they manage to get control over your body, the earth, even mars, then jupiter, etc. imagine they have the entire galaxy fully controlled, even outside of that there are many signal sources, and so if they want to keep trying to block my signals, it just causes "me" to become a reflection of more signal sources -- which is a pretty cool thing. I mean imagine for them trying to control a supernova in another galaxy (lol!).

so think about it -- we're now on pen-rose specific frequencies that are controllable by "them" but now we're now on a defined set of frequency patterns that other stars, galaxies, and all aspects of the universe can begin to align with. I have a celestial body, that body is part of a system, apart of a system, and so fourth, all the way up. you can see that there are more and more things that are positive about it; I am in a sympathetic relationship with more and more of the universe. another nice thing is that for all of the celestial bodies out there in the universe, it's an opt-in proceedure. I don't think many of them produce many physial enough frequencies, and not enough to really be perceived very much, but as a recovering avid star watcher, I can say that, though nosebook destroys most all of the physical range frequencies, I still became sympathetic on higher frequencies. having a standardised pen-rose traversals, allows any celestial being to transmit now on that frequency. for me, this is already happening, and I love how their attempts to remove it have only been making my ablity to receive on a broader spectrum (increasing in speed, meaning less and less of a physical, or even out of alignment way), and yet I'm still able to receive them means that by canceling my experience, they're expanding it in another dimension.

so, while all of that is a really great thing and all of that, you have to understand that many of those seemingly great advantages will not actually be experienced by me -- mostly because I'm willingly (by entering into astral), destabilising myself by using my visual capacity. you all have seen the limits of what is capabile of perceiving in logical, but the visual is a no-go, because now I'm seeing, not thinking. I don't really know what I'm going to do, but I'm going to figure it out (the hard way at least), how to do it -- because they're a reflection of my perception (whether they hide behind an illusion, or not). they're sort of stuck with me on that.

lots of stuff to think about.
