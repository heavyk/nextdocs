# turtle and phoenix

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/vVvGwzZvQhw)

never heard of this poem, but as tim is talking I'm getting a lot of ideas. I still have yet to read the poem, so these are initial impressions.

- the birds are phoenix (a symbol of reurrection) and also the turtle dove
  - immediately, this reminds me of jeortau (dove) and mars (phoenix).
    - I imagine that this poem has something to do with 1-2-7, so the missing part here is the desire symbolism.
    - further on this, the union of the two birds produce something that transcends reason (3rd ray)
      - so again, this poem reminds me of the transition from the 1st ray triad (1-2-3) to the reverse 1st ray triad (1-2-7)
      - in the original 1st ray triad, the 2nd ray (jeortau) is the phoenix
        - later on, as defined by the baptism of jesus, when jesus receives the holy spirit, it appears as a dove coming down and entering
        - because of various things that I've read, jesus is constantly associated with elijah, which I associate with mars, a 7th ray.
        - combine mars (7) with the "father"/anatau (1) and you have the 1-7 alpha and omega porspectives in the same body.
        - the only thing remaining now, is the 2nd ray (dove symbol), and a rebirthing (phoenix).
      - therefore, in the reverse 1st ray triad (1-2-7), the symbol is no longer the phoenix, but the dove -- the promise after the destruction.

- poem is divided into 3x22 line segments, with one concluding line.
  - it may be possible that the sections refer directly to the different aspects of the new (1-2-7) triad, as from the 1-2-3 perspective, this is the descent into reason and logic (thinking analytically - aryan vs atlatian)
  - however, once descended into pure physicality (materialism) and reason, now things reverse, and so it's perceived from the 1-2-7 perspective in which we're now heading back toward desire.
  - notice that, from the 1-2-3 perspective, desire appears as purpose or willpower
