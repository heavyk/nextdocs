# turtle and phoenix

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/vVvGwzZvQhw)

never heard of this poem, but as tim is talking I'm getting a lot of ideas. I still have yet to read the poem, so these are initial impressions.

- the birds are phoenix (a symbol of reurrection) and also the turtle dove
  - immediately, this reminds me of jeortau (dove) and mars (phoenix).
    - I imagine that this poem has something to do with 1-2-7, so the missing part here is the desire symbolism.
    - further on this, the union of the two birds produce something that transcends reason (3rd ray)
      - so again, this poem reminds me of the transition from the 1st ray triad (1-2-3) to the reverse 1st ray triad (1-2-7)
      - in the original 1st ray triad, the 2nd ray (jeortau) is the phoenix
        - later on, as defined by the baptism of jesus, when jesus receives the holy spirit, it appears as a dove coming down and entering
        - because of various things that I've read, jesus is constantly associated with elijah, which I associate with mars, a 7th ray.
        - combine mars (7) with the "father"/anatau (1) and you have the 1-7 alpha and omega porspectives in the same body.
        - the only thing remaining now, is the 2nd ray (dove symbol), and a rebirthing (phoenix).
      - therefore, in the reverse 1st ray triad (1-2-7), the symbol is no longer the phoenix, but the dove -- the promise after the destruction.

- poem is divided into 3x22 line segments, with one concluding line.
  - it may be possible that the sections refer directly to the different aspects of the new (1-2-7) triad, as from the 1-2-3 perspective, this is the descent into reason and logic (thinking analytically - aryan vs atlatian)
  - however, once descended into pure physicality (materialism) and reason, now things reverse, and so it's perceived from the 1-2-7 perspective in which we're now heading back toward desire.
  - notice that, from the 1-2-3 perspective, desire appears as purpose or willpower (emissive), but from the 1-2-7 perspective, it now appears more as something very attractive.

- the birds don't produce any offspring, reminding us of the first 17 sonnets where the fair youth (adonis?) is being advised to produce offspring


### personal notes

as a general thing that I want to note here, I'd like to mention that there are three major characters that show up for me all the time. first is mars (the young stallion/fair youth, etc.), then there is venus (black/ham/dark is her colour, and she has echos in every major female role like gertrude/ophelia) kinda shapeshifting between them all, and then finally the older father type (adonis/saturn/vulcan). these get conflated, as all three of them take on different roles.

---

the other thing I'd like to note here is that as tim is talking about the birds having a full and complete death (no resurrection), complete without having any offspring, this is really the "end" for this dynamic pair, I get these pictures showing up in my head, which I'm not so sure how to describe.

it reminds me of an event that happened the other day when I was watching the honey bees going around from flower to flower, they appearerd to me as very fragile -- which is sorta true; in comparison to the bees, a wasp does not at all look fragile: it has a sleek design and I know from experience that unless I really destroy their bodies irreparably, they're quite able to recover from a good whack and get back even to flying around. they're quite durable. anyway, as I was watching these bees buzz around and go from flower to flower (from vagina to vagina), I noticed this other one that was going around. he was all black with yellow stripes (opposite colour scheme of a yellow-jacket or wasp) and he was going around as well.

it's important to note that these were sage(?) bushes with purple flowers that appear in somethming of a fibonacci sequence around the stem as the plant ascends (the leaves are at the bottom). the plant itself is quite a *weed* in nature and will grow pretty well, even without too much water. I'll consider it an advanced weed. it's also important to note that its flowers are not like the normal flowers that a plant has, where they appear at the top of the stem. as the plant reaches new heights, (has sufficient leaves nutrients on the bottom) little purple cylinders "pop" out from the stem, and then from out of these cylinders pops a tiny purple flower. the cylendars are already the seeds that will grow up to be new bushes, but I believe the function of the flower is to get a foreign (diverse) input as the bees reach for the pollen inside there (this may also increase fertility or gene mixing, not sure). if a mushroom or a normal flower has a single stage deployment where the seeds are inside of the flower/cap, this one appears a bit different. very interesting.

anyway, I'm watching this black bee/wasp go around and his behaviour was pretty notable, because he didn't care so much for the (matured) flowers coming out of the seeds, but was much more interested in the seeds themselves. I couldn't really see what he was doing to the seeds because my eyesight was especially poor that day, but I noticed a few things that made him very different from the bees:

1. if a bee lands on a branch that another bee is aready on, the first bee will fly off as soon as the other one lands. they tend not to occupy the same branch and remain in motion. this black one was not on the same frequency as the bees, and would often times occupy the same branch as the bees, and he even had a few near collisions with the bees.
2. the bees are never seen on the ground, but this black one spent quite a lot of time on the ground where many many seeds had already fallen. not sure what he was doing exactly, but he was definitely doing something to/with the seeds down on the ground (seeds on the ground lose a lot of their colour and appear a very yellow-greyish violet now).
3. I noticed a bit of roof shingle on the ground next to him and went to pick it up. he seemed a bit upset that I was disturbing things in his environment, but didn't really attack me. later, I tried to put my finger down so he could climb on top of it, but he seemed very uninterested in me. he maintained a dilligent business that the bees have for the flowers, but with the seeds. he did not want any interruptions to his work on the seeds.

I found all of this fascinating, and while I was watching this, a similar image popped into my head that did when tim was explaining that the phoenix and dove do not make any natural offspring and so they do appear to finally die out... the image in both of these cases contatained the quality that the flowers represented mature reproductive capable vaginas, in that they can produce offspring genetically, but the seeds -- let's just say that these do not produce plants because they haven't been pollenated properly. the idea here is that the black bee, because he is interacting with young seeds that do not have a flower or old seeds that have already fallen, this would not produce cross-pollenated offspring like the bees were helping the other seeds to do.

the conclusion that I came to in that moment is that I'm sorta similar to the black one in that I'm a sort of hybrid between the wasp and the bee. this is interesting symbolism, because I associate the editors of jesus' story to be the "flavian touch". titus flavius vespasianus (vespasian) is the roman emperor that I (and doug) believe is responsible for many of the edits done to the gospels and also the originator of the pen name "josephus". the important part here is the wasp's assoication with the roman emperor reigning around 69 AD (interestingly he also died at age 69), and that vespa is wasp in spanish/latin. the flavian dynasty even came to an end on (dates are important to these guys) 18 (3x6) of september (9) of 96 (69 backwards).

the wasp is the roman attribute, and the bee is something else. there's an interesting line at the end of hamlet where horatio (horatio is a funny name because it reminds me "of time" (saturn) or "of the hour"), and as hamlet is dying, horatio wants to drink the poison too, saying, "I am more an antique roman than a dane". the romans, I make the case are the INFECTED ONES (or fallen-angels) and these guys infiltrate high societies by moving their consciousness into bodies of young children or newborns of the upper nobility class, allowing them to be born into and become rightful heirs to positions of power in these high societies. they don't create the high society, they just try and take over powerful positions of those socities. in general, the red ones are a mixed bag, but it seems that they have a strong desire to have good conditions. these red ones (often red cross or red rose in centre of white) achieve these feats of technology because have access to expanded perception and imaginary capacities. through these "esoteric" practises and secret rituals. they seem to originate mostly from atlantis (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/BqmgUzOpb84?t=916)). dane refers to the tribe of dan, which is symbolised by the serpent and the colour red (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/BqmgUzOpb84?t=1008)). hamlet seems to be a play all about that.

I'll get to the conclusion in a second, but I'd like to make the point that in the tragedy of hamlet, ham (black) is mentioned, so is norway and also japheth, which is mostly taken to be the king in northern palestine (samaria) that sacrificed his daughter because he was a man of his word (hamlet struggles to follow through with what he says he'll do, and adonis also struggles with this). claudius clearly represents one of these inpleasant infiltratrators that userps the kingdom. note that elizabeth was the last of the tudor (black madonna) dynasty, and she had no heirs. instead, I believe that devere moved this expanded form of perception off into the secret societies (rosicurcians and the builders guilds -- rosencrantz and guildenstern)... OK, ending the rabbit trail.

back to my conclusion: I saw myself as that black wasp/bee that was not interested in pollenating mature flowers (genetic heirs), but instead, I'm concerning myself with something that produces no issue, which is messing with the unpollenated seeds which will likely not grow up. my job here is not to leave behind a genetic legacy or biological bloodline or whatever, but instead to plant conceptual seeds, which will eventually grow up differently. I do that by having the form of the wasp (romans, claudius) and just going about my own way. no need for me to leave behind any physical legacy, to instead leave behind a legacy of desire. things have reversed their polarity now. instead of using reason and going toward physicality, now I'm leaving behind the manifestation that leaves the most to be desired (a tragedy -- which is a physical disaster, but produces much desire instead). it's kinda difficult to put this into words, honestly. hopefully the connections are clear enough to see.

the whole point is to kill the phoenix and the turtle (the ascending and decending aspects of the 2nd ray in the 1st ray triad), so that we're no longer fixated on the physical but instead on the what it is that each person *individually* wants/desires. the king/group structure's time has now passed (which is why horatio (of time/saturn) has the ending explanation and finally explains to the (white?) outside of the masses wtf is going on) and fortenbro (norway, the new nordic power structure) takes over the "kingdom". it looks like a tragedy, but it's really the perfect setup for individuality and art to emerge, which is why I think the troubadours/players take on the new narration position. you see, from now on, it's all about the individual and what the individual wants/desires...

### "The Phoenix and Turtle"

Let the bird of loudest lay
On the sole Arabian tree
Herald sad and trumpet be,
To whose sound chaste wings obey.

But thou shrieking harbinger,
Foul precurrer of the fiend,
Augur of the fever's end,
To this troop come thou not near.

From this session interdict
Every fowl of tyrant wing,
Save the eagle, feathered king;
Keep the obsequy so strict.

Let the priest in surplice white,
That defunctive music can,
Be the death-divining swan,
Lest the requiem lack his right.

And thou treble-dated crow,
That thy sable gender mak'st
With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st,
'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.

Here the anthem doth commence:
Love and constancy is dead,
Phoenix and the turtle fled
In a mutual flame from hence.

So they loved, as love in twain
Had the essence but in one,
Two distincts, division none;
Number there in love was slain.

Hearts remote yet not asunder,
Distance and no space was seen
'Twixt this turtle and his queen;
But in them it were a wonder.

So between them love did shine
That the turtle saw his right
Flaming in the phoenix' sight;
Either was the other's mine.

Property was thus appalled
That the self was not the same;
Single nature's double name
Neither two nor one was called.

Reason, in itself confounded,
Saw division grow together,
To themselves yet either neither,
Simple were so well compounded

That it cried, "How true a twain
Seemeth this concordant one!
Love hath reason, Reason none,
If what parts can so remain,"

Whereupon it made this threne
To the phoenix and the dove,
Co-supremes and stars of love,
As chorus to their tragic scene.


Threnos


Beauty, truth, and rarity,
Grace in all simplicity,
Here enclosed, in cinders lie.

Death is now the phoenix' nest,
And the turtle's loyal breast
To eternity doth rest,

Leaving no posterity;
'Twas not their infirmity,
It was married chastity.

Truth may seem, but cannot be;
Beauty brag, but 'tis not she;
Truth and beauty buried be.

To this urn let those repair
That are either true or fair;
For these dead birds sigh a prayer.

### threnos

I noticed this word stuck out at me. when I first saw it, I noticed it is "three" and "nos" ("we" - first person plural in spanish/latin). nos is also in the sense of gnosis or gnostic, in that it means knowledge: sophia. I thought about it as "knowledge of threes" -- which is interesting because that's also something that tesla explains is pretty important (importance of 3-6-9) and I myself carry on endlessly about these "triads" (of an emitter ground and female, or two females of opposite types and a ground). after that line, as if to demonstrate this the final part of the poem has triads (beauty, truth, rarity) instead of dualities (love and reason, love and constancy).

the whole poem is a move from 2 to 3. I also see a lot of 4's and 5's though, but for example the 4's are born out of the 2's and 5's are born out of the structure itself.

to illustrate, notice how in the first 20 (5x4) lines, it's talking about the alpha omega character of these birds (eagle and crow). harbinger of sadness, ending of tyrants and priests, and then on the 6th paragraph, the thing comences. I see the eagle as the opposite of the phoenix, and the crow/swan as the opposite of the turtledove (the swan is death-divining and the crow gives and takes breath). they're literally identified as the priests and the kings/tyrants. the turtle divides into two (crow and swan).

the next thing to note is that they become "either neither": "any one" or "no one", so they're apart but together, yet while they're together, they're one, but also two, yet also three. they're all or nothing at the same time, yet out of that emerges the three.

first 20 (5x4) lines: alpha/omega (beginning and end of priests and kings)
4 lines: comence the beginning of the transition into three
7-13(x4) lines: explains they are 2, 1, and 0 -- therefore, they are three.
threenos: we are knowledge of the threes.
final 5x3 lines: here are three things that are all dead (0)

I would like to mention too that because they are "no one" but at the same time they are "any one" (either or neither), this is likely referring to the general population (anyone), and what makes them now become "any one" is because of the things that are now dead.

### death of beauty, truth, and rarity

this line makes perfect sense to me looking at the society that we live in today, especially in the context of nosebook. it's easy to see that "truth" is dead (narrative is not truth). rarity is pretty easy to see when considering the internet nowadays, as unlimited access to knowledge has made rarity of information a thing of the past. now, if you consider the idea of looking for a partner, and what you're looking for is something "rare" (like a knight in shining armour, or a super chivalrous noble(wo)man) to sweep you off of your feet, those are rare, but we're entereing a time where these sorts of things are losing their attractive qualities.

to explain why I think rarity dies, is because of the death of beauty and truth. if everyone is very beautiful, there is no longer any single most beautiful person that is considerably more attractive than the rest. we see this already today where there are soo manyyy beautiful people nowadays, it's hard to say that beautiful people are rare anymore. beauty is quite common.

truth is another interesting thing to see die. to get an insight into shakespere's mind on this I refer to hamlet, where rosencrantz, guildenstern, and hamlet talk in unison about the future (doomsday), claiming that the world has grown honest, and that "every one" is happy, but "no one" is overly happy. comparing this fortune where overhappy is the top of her head, and unhappy would by thte souls of her shoes, but instead they're around her waist, in the middle of her favours -- in her secret parts. she claims she is a strumpet, which reminds me strongly of the first paragraph:

    Let the bird of loudest lay
    On the sole Arabian tree
    Herald sad and trumpet be,
    To whose sound chaste wings obey.

the bird of loudest lay sounds very sexual to me. the strumpet fortune (whore of babylon) is making everyone happy, but not overly happy (she's a loud lay), which causes "chaste wings" to obey her -- which sounds to me like if a loud lay is causing chaste wings to obey, this sounds like a sexual revolution to me.

so, along with the world becoming "honest" hamlet is proposing that there will also be a future sexual revolution at the same time. long gone are the days where someone of beauty and rarity comes to you and tells you the truth. all of this happiness (but not overly happy), souds a lot to me like good-enoughness.

you have to see that the 2nd ray in descending down into the physical, is a "saviour" figure, and so they will look around in the world and see all of the things that are *not* good enough and try to improve/save those things (because you're moving away from desire), but on the ascent, all things are now desirable, and so everything is now desirable. all truth becomes "good enough" cause it's just a narrative anyway, so whatever man, beauty is everywhere and so all things desirable are easily perceived now, meaning that rarity of something desirable is no longer a thing. beauty and truth are now in the eye of the beholder, and now everything is moving on the path of becoming more and more "good enough" rathar than less and less "good enough".

I hope I explained the seeming contradiction between truth and beauty being dead, but at the same time thteir death has now made it possible for everyone to be true (grown honest) and fair. the connecting idea is the rarity. if what you want/desire is no longer rare and what you wanted is truth, then, "truth" is now "every one" but because truth requires a opposite falsehood to exist, "truth" no longer exists "no one" has truth anymore.

another try: if everyone has $100 and everything costs more than $100, nobody has enough (rarity/scarcity exists). however if everything now costs, $1, then with $100 everybody now has enough (abundance exists). nothing really changed, other than the market is flooded with desirable (good enough) things. reason doesn't explain this very well. it seems paradoxical, but it's basic economics.
