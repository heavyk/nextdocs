a long time ago, I noticed that pyramus and thisbe can be seen as the two hemispheres of my brain (and the wall between). therfore, last night when I was watching midsommers-nights-dream, I was having a difficult time identifying with any single one of the characters. and -- this time surprisingly, I felt next to zero resonance with either hermia or helena -- which is weird because I identify *a lot* with helena of alls-well-that-ends-well.

one of the breakthroughs for me was to realise nico's characters in his play "[andria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andria_(Machiavelli))" that one super character:

- Simone, who wants his son, Panfilo, to marry *Filumena*, the *daughter of his neighbour Cremete*.
- Panfilo has, however, a secret love affair with *Glicerio*
- Critone, recognizes *Glicerio* as *Pasibula*. *Pasibula* *was Cremete's daughter*, who was thought to have died in a shipwreck
- Panfilo marries *Glicerio*, and Carino, a friend of his, marries Filumena.

as you can see there, glicero is pasibula, who is also flumena. therefore, when they marry at the end, glicero is marrying both of them, because his friend "carino" is the spanish (and possibly italian as well) word for "affection".

why this is important is because I'm noticing more and more that shakespere takes one super character and then divides them into parts so that they can interact with theirselves (like valentine writing himself love poetry). the overall arc of the individual characters represents an internal struggle on the inside of the viewer (the composite super character).

so, for example, as I'm watching alls-well-that-ends-well, I noticed that in addition to helena I'm identifying with both parolles and also bertram. I was able to see the connection only today there because last night (after *reading* parts of the play,) I realised that the characters, dimitrius and lysander are identifyable to me if I see them as, like pyramus and thisbe, as the two hemispheres of my brain. I am dimitrius right now, and then later by night, I'm lysander. lysander is attractive to hermia (the younger one), and dimitrius (day) is attractive to helena (the older one). these correspond with parolles (day) and bertram (night).puck almost certainly represents nosebook -- as, every single time that I go to sleep, I wake up with new eyes, and strange desires (to watch these plays and write about them, for example).

ironically enough, the play is an adaptation of one of terence's plays, "[a girl from andros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andria_(comedy))" -- which I'm reading -- and it's
