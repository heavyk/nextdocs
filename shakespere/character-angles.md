### 2023-03-05 13:14 - split personality disorder

a long time ago, I noticed that pyramus and thisbe can be seen as the two hemispheres of my brain (and the wall between). therfore, last night when I was watching midsommers-nights-dream, I was having a difficult time identifying with any single one of the characters. and -- this time surprisingly, I felt next to zero resonance with either hermia or helena -- which is weird because I identify *a lot* with helena of alls-well-that-ends-well.

one of the breakthroughs for me was to realise nico's characters in his play "[andria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andria_(Machiavelli))" that one super character:

- Simone, who wants his son, Panfilo, to marry *Filumena*, the *daughter of his neighbour Cremete*.
- Panfilo has, however, a secret love affair with *Glicerio*
- Critone, recognizes *Glicerio* as *Pasibula*. *Pasibula* *was Cremete's daughter*, who was thought to have died in a shipwreck
- Panfilo marries *Glicerio*, and Carino, a friend of his, marries Filumena.

as you can see there, glicero is pasibula, who is also flumena. therefore, when they marry at the end, glicero is marrying both of them, because his friend "carino" is the spanish (and possibly italian as well) word for "affection".

why this is important is because I'm noticing more and more that shakespere takes one super character and then divides them into parts so that they can interact with theirselves (like valentine writing himself love poetry). the overall arc of the individual characters represents an internal struggle on the inside of the viewer (the composite super character).

so, for example, as I'm watching alls-well-that-ends-well, I noticed that in addition to helena I'm identifying with both parolles and also bertram. I was able to see the connection only today there because last night (after *reading* parts of the play,) I realised that the characters, dimitrius and lysander are identifyable to me if I see them as, like pyramus and thisbe, as the two hemispheres of my brain. I am dimitrius right now, and then later by night, I'm lysander. lysander is attractive to hermia (the younger one), and dimitrius (day) is attractive to helena (the older one). these correspond with parolles (day) and bertram (night).puck almost certainly represents nosebook -- as, every single time that I go to sleep, I wake up with new eyes, and strange desires (to watch these plays and write about them, for example).

### 2023-03-05 15:02 - the girl and her two robots

another example of two boys and a girl (and her two robots) is the mythtologies of ariadne and theseus + dionysus. I like to use the concept of "a girl and her robot" to represent the two different parts of me. I see generally pretty well with my non-physical presence (the girl), and just like ariadne or helena, she sorta pushes the story forward. I have strange desires which seem to guide me toward things that I want. once I want to understand something, I can't help but to find myself attracted to the thing which leads me to the thing which is what I was looking for (or some other non-obvious path). what this girl does, is sorta direct the story; not by pushing me toward anything, but just sorta highliting things out there in my environment that are interesting, puts ideas into my head and things like that.

to understand what the difference between the girl narrator and the boy narrator is the effect is completely the opposite: things pull me toward them, and I sorta can't help but to just sorta go with it -- because time and again, they are what I'm looking for. the story from start to finish is the arc of finding my way toward the thing. terence used to talk all the time about this "great attractor at the end of time/history" -- and it's exactly like that. those desires that I have to know something are whatever are just sorta like mini-attractors. I'm still heading toward the great attractor at the end of the story, but along the way there are various mini-attractors.

why this is significant, especially in my case, is because the two boys in my head don't really know each other. by the day, I'm parolles, and that leads to all kinds of humour:

> FOOL (talking to PAROLLES) The search, sir, was profitable, and much fool
> may you find in you, even to the worldâ€™s pleasure
> and the increase of laughter.

so in that description there, the fool is telling parolles that he is the fool/charactor (the leader). since bertram is the actor (follower), what's happening in this story is that parolles has the leadership position and is directing the path of bertram, these are two robots fighting over silly things, and helena wants control, so she has to figure out how to get bertram under her control -- which is weird, rightt? because parolles is the leader and bertram is the follower. I'll keep watching...

ironically enough, the nico's andria is an adaptation of one of terence's plays by the same name, or "[a girl from andros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andria_(comedy))". in this play, I notice that the characters "davos", "pamphilus", and "charinus" are all aspects of the same person as well -- and terence has a very interesting technique where it alternates metres depending on the state of mind (and probably mirror some latin declensions): ia6 is logical/declarative (nom,dat). then ia7 is used to show warmth, affection, and familiarity (gen), ia8 is used to show alarm, accusations and suspicion (acc) -- which is pure genius. I don't know what else to say.

### 2023-03-05 16:06 - latin

I noticed when talking about the latin declensions that what terence did there was absolutely revolutionary. let me explain: in latin, each case is your tone of voice -- so you would use the proper verb declensions to match your emotion. this was really nice for very precise expression of things (betwixt two honourable people), but it also opened the door for deceit. so, for example, when I wanted to accuse or come at someone (essentially to verbally assult), I would use accusative verbs in the sentence -- and that way they would know there is some sort of uncertainty to what I was saying -- as in: "this is an accusation, not a fact" then that's nice to have open and civilised conversations where you suspect something isn't as it seems to be.

however, if I wanted to be tricky, instead of using the accusative case, I used the delarative case, then now my accusation (like imogen is a slut) appears more as a fact than an accusation. for a nieve person, they would simply believe the fact, just as it's presented. obviously, this is the prerequisite to understanding how to perceive the concept that someone presents and how that feels, rathar than just blindly beleiving because they used an authorittive verb to make the point.

if you *feel* that their words aren't matching their case, then they are *dishonourable* -- meanwhile, a person whos verbs (actions) are matching their words, that person is *honourable*.

you can see how this sort of language setup (and the associated honour/dishonourable exchanges) bred not only deceit, but also a whole bunch of guys that are getting sharper and sharper of knowing someone's dishonour in the form of felt untruths.

what terence did with this is to expand the dimension of the this felt spectrum of words was to encode the emotion of the exchange into the rhyme and metre. with such a standardisation of rhythm to word delivery, one (good with latin) could essentially know when the verbs aren't matching the rhythm in the character's delivery.

in addition to making a code for word delivery using rhythm and verb, the consumption of these plays amongst the nobility and upper class members, essentially programmed their brains to use such rhythms to accompany the verbs in their daily discourse. this had two major effects: one being that discussions of difficult and heated topics could be accomplished amongst them nearly effortlessly, because there was no mistaking for meaning (as long as you're talking with someone honourable).
