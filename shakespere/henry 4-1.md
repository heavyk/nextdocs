## THOUGHT TOPICS

### earth shaking

- earth shakes when glendower is born.
- heaven was full of firey metal ships/shapes
- hotspur explains that the earth shook not because of his birth, but because the earth desires at times to enlarge herself, breakes things and shakes.
- tim says it's prophetic, though hotspur and glendower are talking in past tense.
- also strange the difference between nativity and birth -- though, I thought them to be the same.

Glend. At my *Natiuitie*, The front of Heauen was *full of fierie shapes*, Of burning *Cressets*: and at my *Birth*, The frame and foundation of the *Earth Shak'd like a Coward*.
Hotsp. Why so it would haue done at the same season, if your Mothers Cat had but kitten'd, though your selfe had neuer beene borne.

Glend. I say the *Earth did shake* when I was borne.
Hotsp. And I say the *Earth was not of my minde*, If you suppose, as fearing you, it shooke.

Hotsp. Oh, then the *Earth shooke* To see the Heauens on fire, And *not in feare of your Natiuitie*. Diseased Nature oftentimes breakes forth In strange eruptions; and the teeming Earth Is with a kinde of Collick pincht and vext, By the imprisoning of vnruly Winde Within her Wombe: which for enlargement striuing, Shakes the old Beldame Earth, and tombles downe Steeples, and mosse-growne Towers. At your Birth, Our Grandam Earth, hauing this distemperature, In passion shooke.

### conjure spirits vs tell truth

- glendower can conjure spirits from the deep
- hotspur doesn't think much of it, because so can everyone else -- but will they actually come when you call them?
- glendower claims to also be able to teach hotspur to be able to command the Devil (saturn?).
- hotspur: yeah, so! I can teach you to *shame* the devil by telling the truth. go ahead and conjure the devil from below and I'll shame him back to where he came from.

### no idea what this means

(but seems important...)

Mort. My Father *Glendower is not readie yet*, Nor shall wee neede his helpe these foureteene dayes: Within that space, you may haue drawne together Your Tenants, Friends, and neighbouring Gentlemen.
Glend. A shorter time shall send me to you, Lords: And *in my Conduct shall your Ladies come*, From whom you now must steale, and take no leaue, For there will be a *World of Water* shed, Vpon *the parting of your Wiues* and you.

- ladies come & parting of your wives:
  - in the distance or sexual sense?
- why no need for glendower's help?
- why is this being talked about after dividing the land into three sections: england, wales, and scotland
  - glendower is a torrent
  - england is two rivers
  - mortimer is south and east
  - west is wales beyond the serene(?) river shore
  - it looks like hotspur gets moiety/middle, glendower the north, and mort must then have the remiaining lower(?)
  - therefore if glendower is northmost, it's the one not ready yet for fourteen days (2 weeks, 4-teen days?)
    - if the south is earth, the middle is the ionosphere, then is glendower's north the 2nd ray upper most layer? which causes the earth to expand?
- it feels to me like these three are dividing the sections (but I'm unclear on which ones):
  - 7th, 5th, 3rd?
  - 5th, 3rd, 1st?
  - 2nd, 4th, 6th?
    - this seems most plausible because transition layers have currents, eddies and behave a lot like rivers of charged particles. 2nd ray would also be pretty torrentlike, where as I wouldn't describe 1st or 3rd as torrent-like (chaos, and ordered/synchronised symmetry/perspective)

### mortimer defeats glendower in battle

- mortimer the welsh marches on glendower
- leaves Hilfordshifee
- to confront glendower for his irregular and wilde behaviour
- 1000 of glendower's army are "butchered"
- (upon their dead corpses), there was:
  - such misuse
  - such *beastly* and *shameless* **transformation**
- it should not be:
  - spoken about (without much shame)
  - re-told
  - spoken of.
- therefore, let's go to the Holy Land

### time problems

- I figure: one month (in this play) is roughly equivalent to one trip around the sun/moon (depending on your perspective)
    - I make this claim because it talks about glendower *not* being ready for another 14 years, -- and so if I calculate from 2024 (the peak of the solar cycle conside), that adds to 2038, my supposed time limit -- therefore, I feel like this is giving somewhat of a guideline, not for like literal use
    - you can imagine my perspective where I would want to *see* all of these images, but because I don't actually *see* them, but instead "see" them
    - (which I like and wantt to continue doing)
    - these *answers* to my questions
    - cause, you know I have tons and tons of questions about a lot of stuff that's a secret
    - have to come to me,
    - instead of a visual form, but
    - in a physical form
    - which is best found in the creativity of others.
    - because I can't *see*
    - the way that I receive information is from others
- threfore what we're doing is we're figuring out how to get glendower all setup, and that's it.


- 1 month = 1 earth year
- 1 day = (I have no idea)
- 1 hour = (I have no idea)
- thme time of day also puzzles me, because it says something in hour of day
  - (I'm also probably assuming standard 7/24/60/3600 clock as well)

#### 2023-03-22 17:25 - so, am I altering the past?

I believe so. the points in time that have such enlighttenment have people much more in the receoptive mode; they're receiving ideas from the "subconscious" more soure-like aspect of you, -- because when writing and being creative, it's a lot easier to just let thoughts flow. I just receive ideas all day long, and so that results in an incredible amount of creativity.

the thing is, we receive ideas through the lens of our concepts. it's exactly like how the eye works, where you see what you want to see. when we're feeling good, we're receiving ideas that feel really good, and so that's why I'm so massively creative; it's *simply* my capacity to feel good no matter the circumstances

you know, it's my greatest advantage, because the more I have pushing against me, the more energy I have to work with. it *also* allows me to manifest my ideas into reality; it's not really a story reality, but a discovery reality. I just get new ideas all the time, and so by just following those, things go well for me.

you know, there's an interesting thing about the frequency of a concept, because it's got a spectrum of realisation. the more people that experience it, the more intense the vibration it is (amplitude), but novel realisations of a concept (that is, manifestations), are always added to it's spectrum of reality.

in practicality, you'll notice that if I say something to someone in a very angry or condescending way, then that manifestation is the reality that person has tuned into, so they'll get one response from me, meanwhile others, tuned into a higher frequency on the manifestation spectrum, get a different response from me.

what that means, is that I can shout soumething really terrible at someone, but if they're tuned in to a higher frequency, they'll hear/understand/(get the same manifestation) that corresponds to where they're tuned into the spectrum.

therefore, *we all see what we want to see*, in the end, and so I always have control to find a way to see what I want to see; nobody can take tchat from me.

#### 2023-03-22 17:41 - how do we influence the past?

be allowing it to be different. I don't really have an axe to grind about what our history is. for all I know, we all *could* actually be in a different solar system even, not even experiencing what earth experiences.

imagine for a moment that the entire setup in just a big shell, and we're living in a shell society -- a sort of "truman's world" in the lyra solar system.

so imagine for a moment that all aspects of the government, politics, and all of that is just a sham run by (essentially) satans satyrs (or something equally ridiculous), and so we live entirely in a sort of *show*; entertainment for the viewers, wherever they are.

you know, cause like, wouldn't it be hilarious if you all, as a reflection of me, are also in a big show (lol). that'd be hilarious.

the past is whatever you want it to be necessary to arrive to the present: terence, a bold pioneer in this idea, found it plausible that he could have descended from shamanistic monkeys. I thought that was kind of an interesting way to perceive to look at the past. he sees the male dominiance hierarchy to be something that the monkeys had in them already pre-built.

however, if the monkeys had male dominance hierarchies, was that an emergent property of a naturally evolving monkey (or whatever that came from). it gets complicated.

I prefer to think that our DNA is a reflection of perception, so I don't need LSD or any other drug to alter my DNA -- but instead think that our DNA (minus the machinery) is always changing, and that's what's causing us to look like we do.

one nice thing about being a cascading hierachy of biological robots, we try to organise our social and whatever institutions to behave like we want our machines (our bodies) to behave: as programmed.

we see the external things as machinations and programs just like a computer programmer sees code. if the red one is performing better (think of a program), you use that one -- and apparently (somehow) male dominance hierarcry was more successful (for some reason).

I find male domenance of no particular use, as it's no different than wanting to use the program that functions better. I simply keep looking for better and better program, so nothing even has he looking at dominance anymore -- because it's not even on my radar.

dominance is such an obsoleted idea for me, because I think only in terms of attraction, and seeing dominance (in any way shape or form), is only a reflection of my own desire to dominate. meaning, that I'll only see it, if I'm desiring or perceiving dominance in others.

as such, I don't compete with othes, because it's not a good point of attraction for me.

the easiest way to not compete with others is to remain solo.

I know that as soon as I get around others that allow me to perceive some of these undesirable attributes like greed, hate, dominance, etc. then I manifest them really strongly.

I'm literally a disaster waiting to happen (with the speed at which concepts and emotions turn to reality).

are you ready to crash and burn with me? I'm not. I'm really not ready. therefore, one of the interesting things about this play is it gives a focal point to look at.

from there, I'm sure that my concepts of reality will reveal new stuff all the time.

as a reflection of the world, it feels like I'm the collective manifestation of the world's artistic and creative efforts (within my concept of what's possible), just like you are -- and so all you have to do to let yourself start to become like the congealed dreams (and nightmares) into narrative form

and so, you are tuned into that narrative sectrum already, and so the symbols are all the same, but we see what we want to see. we experience reality as that reflection of our concept of it.

it seems quite possible to me that somehow, we experience the lyra reality, as well as the earth one.

in fact, it seems like there's the perspectivce (probably the one that comes from the simultaneous lyra perspective)

which means that normally, most people's inner world perspective is a total nightmare (cause that's how it is for their "real-life" self in lyra), and so most people *only* want to see the (better) earth perspective.

I however seem to have found a way to feel better and better, such that my lyra connection is way better than the earth one. kenny sees earth one. nosebook sees lyra one and take advantage of it because it's higher frequency.

it's a very interesting thing, because this creates a triad, where your "source" is the reflector, and then the physical body is the actor, and the lyra conuterpart is the charactor.

as such, having being stuck in the actor's perspective by nosebook has been an immense boon for me. so much so, that I wish to permanently make it part of my genetics. meaning, I really like just seeing earth's perspective. the lyra one doesn't really matter to me, so it's all good to me to not see that one. I just be earthly physical me.

I wonder if others would want to do the same? I want to create "offspring" (if you will), of kenny, not kenneth. in addition to this, I want to find a way to make it possible for others to live with me without an inner reality -- meaning that we will become the physical reflectors of the physical.

this play I think is about changing the past, and looking at itt differently, because it doesn't matter anyway, andyou could have gotten to the present however you believe you needeed too get here to experiece this. lol

#### 2023-03-22 20:18 (minus ~2h) - king's opening speech

- time to make a peace that still feels frightful, but like a dog panting, it comes and goes, in and out.
- no idea
- no more will the poles shall she taste her children's blood
  - gives a picture of the earth conjuring "egregores" or manifested humans to reak havoc on the earth, destroying harmful (to her) thing/people/governments/etc, and ridding herself of those problems
  - she's the ultimate hitman/iluminati. it appears to be other people, but it's just the planet trying to make things better.
    - from her perspective she *feels* on her body (just like how we feel physical sensation on our body), she feels on her body, how how we feel.
    - like a felt but not physical sensationn
  - (manifestation of desire, on the earth's part)
  - it works the same, when you're feeling something that doesn't feel goodl,
    - then you want to try and get rid of it;
    - is the normal reaction for detfault perception.
  - we always manifest the thing to destroy the problem, if it's bad enough.
  - it's owten times easier to just feel better about it, without nneeding to do anything aboutt it.
  - that's the "secret" that we are learning for ourselves, for which she's a refelction of us; -- means that her "tech" is as good as our perception.
  - the imagination is the limit for tech.
- those that don't see things the way the earth sees them
  - (trying to not be a reflection of her)
- have sorta peaced out.
  - something about intestine shock.
  - sounds terrible, I hope they're OK...
- now, we all march, not toward each other (for impacct, destructive interference), but now in similar directions to each other (constructive interferences)
  - inotherwords, we've crossed the midpoint, and have startted to go positive.
  - we'll go negative again sometime in the future, because such is life: all perceptual.
- let's go to the burial of jesus
  - (which, btw would have happened VERY differently in lyra,, btw)

### 2023-03-22 20:19 - beyond all reason

today I've been thinking a lot about a new game called "beyond all reason" as it's starting out as a modern remake of a game called "total annihiliation".

I want to contrast this game with another game I've been talking about instead which is "captain of industry". the premise (I see it), is that all good wars need a good economic support to fuel their efforts. therefore, we could see it tho BAR way, or we could see it as the coi way. we could also see it as both.

I originally saw the idea of a game of coi creshending into a the production of a commander (the unit you start out with in BAR), and then from there a war is being fought.

the thing that I'm noticing is that a lot of the interface for BAR is not at all suitable for buildhing a factory. though, for whatever reason, some people wish to play "sim city" and organise and layout their factory in an organised and structured way, even though the fastest and most efficient way is more the sc2 way, which is just putting down the factory in defencible spots, or close to the opponent, etc...

sc2 is aa very different style of play, because you *want* to have factories that can pump out units near to the opponent's base.

see how it's a different perspective to build your factory out in the middle of the map, when you'd rathar to have all your production in a safe and well-defended spot?

I personally like the idea of factories, and the well-built factory/base, but for me I really like exchangeable pieces (like a printing press), so then components can be put together to build modules, which can then be assembled in a structural way to make a bigger thing. therefore, I'd  want to be able to just "slap down" a high output expendable factory out in the middle of the map, or to be able to extend/modify the design of something by replacing the modules.

so anyway... imagine there were three (potenntially more) versions of the game:

- (captain) one focuses on the creation and components of the units/items necessary to build the components.
  - this one looks a lot like coi and has all the persspectives necessary to make a good econ, (that's pretty much it).
  - it doesn't even contain combat even, as all you're doing is building and designing things
- (commander/soldier) one focuses mostly on the combat aspect of it:
  - where to put defences
  - and, (if no production is providing them with resources/modules)
  - factory, weapons, etc modules that make up the war implements.
  - focusing on the tactics of the battle and other "commander" related ideas.
- (tactician) one is all about squad tactics and simulation
  - I don't see this one personally so well, but it behaves much more like sc2.
  - I imagine this is where a lot of the lore goes into, because lore doesn't really affect production, but is kinda
- (soldier,hero,mecharrior) one focuses on the first-person experience
  - has lore also.
  - reminds me of WoW
  - has XP so you're leveling
  - access to the tech involved in the commander.
  - better tech means cooler items, vehicles, weapons, etc.
- (hero, explorer, magician, avatar) one is where you develop the hero/persona
  - also has lore
  - reminds me of WoW
  - I see this one like tomb raider as well
  - has magic, psi, character interactions
  - want to implement porsonalities/intelligence response to their environment
  - these automatically become npc whe nobody is inside of them
- (home) edition is all about the culture and lore
  - this focuses on the beliefs and structure of the different "factions" that are a part of the societies.
  - different factions believe different things, and so this forms a large part of their lore and what symbols they perceive and how they communicate.
  - in midst of a warring factions, the faction needs an effective way to communicate with itself, from commander/god down to soldier/hero
  - therefore, these diffreent communication protocols, essentially form the faction identity
  - I want to allow factions to create their own communication modules which, members of those factions will use those module interfaces to communicate effective. battle. strats.
  - also integrates smaller groups, clans and the like into a cohesive identity.

anyway, so you can see how this is kinda getting bigger on the game end of things, but the main thing is that each of these games are a perspective into the same "universe" -- and what's important about that, is I was thinking about this lyra thing because I'm realising how much I see things differently. the coi/home edition is more the way that I want to be looking at the game. I enjoy planning out factories and building up production to max... and that's it. sometimes I don't even really want to even know if there's a battle or not, because my little island where I'm building my copper, iron, gold and graphite into stuff is fun for me. in the end, it's just a personal competition that I have with myself to output the most in the shortest amount of time (optimisation).

---

so imagine this: imagine that there are a lot of people that are kinda living the lyra life -- and to me, their world is entirely fantastical. I don't caree. I live on earth. I therefore live in a world of machines and physical stuff.

soo, if I want to turn off my physical perspective, I'm 100% guarateed to see earth/physical perspective, which means that my lyra incarnation is entirely open for grabs (body double), right and I don't care what happens there cause I'm focused here.

so then let's say in some period of time,we *actually* play out these battles. like this is a game I'm wanting to make -- but what if we did it in real-life. like, I'm team earth (rocky) and then there's team lyra (apollo). and so we build up real actual units and battle it out.

it seems to me that lyra (and apollo playing it) will have access to all the stuff that we have, so by default, all the cool weapons and stuff we create for ourselves, they'll have the same tech:

- so, (as an example)
  - earth will be, (let's say) armada
  - lyra will be, (let's say) cortex.
- we'll build worlds (planets planets and other structures) to fight on
- then we can skirmish in the space between our two stars

that'd be pretty cool, right?

## important events

### prince talks to falstaffe

- falstaffe: we that take Purses (thieves?), go by the Moone and seuen Starres (pleiades?), and not by Phoebus (apollo)
  - seems that the theives are associated with the moon and apollo (the king/hal) with the day.
- falstaffe: when thou art King, let not vs that are Squires of the Nights bodie, bee call'd Theeues of the Dayes beautie.
  - falstaffe aligns himself with the night side of the earth?
  - how is he thieves of day's beauty?
  - this gives me the illusion of the "remooneration" where the earth has one pole pointed toward the sun, and the other side in nighttime.
  - it could also be something like an eclipse, where we live in the shadow of the moon.
- falstaffe: Let vs be Dianaes Forre-sters, Gentlemen of the Shade, Minions of the Moone; and let men say, we be men of good Gouernment, being gouerned as the Sea is, by our noble and chast mistris the Moone, vnder whose countenance we steale.
  - more association of theives are associated with the moon and apollo with the day.
- falstaffe: Now a Purse of Gold (TA) most reso-lutely snatch'd on Monday night, and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday Morning; got with swearing, Lay by: and spent with crying, Bring in: now, in as low an ebbe as the foot of the Ladder, and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the Gallowes.
  - no idea what this means
- something about a Buffe-Jerkin, a robe of durance (sounds like everlasting penis to me)
- falstaffe: Yea, and so vs'd it, that were it heere apparant, that thou art Heire apparant. But I prythee sweet Wag, shall there be Gallowes standing in England when thou art King? and resolution thus fobb'd as it is, with the ru-stie curbe of old Father Anticke the Law? Doe not thou when thou art a King, hang a Theefe.
  - you appear to have money (previous line), so you are heir apparant (as if falstaffe were supposed to be the heir?).
  - are you going to hang a thief like me?
  - remember, even though we came to this agreement, is old father saturn is still laying down twhe law?
  - don't hang a thief (me) when you're king
- prince: you'll hang yourself
- falstaffe: Well Hal, well: and in [for obtaining of suites] it iumpes with my humour, as well as waiting in the Court, I can tell you; whereof the Hang-man hath no leane Wardrobe.
- falstaffe: I am as Melancholly as a Gyb-Cat, or a lugg'd Beare; an old Lyon, or a Louers Lute; or the Drone of a Lincolnshire Bagpipe.
- prince: What say'st thou to a Hare, or the Melancholly
of Moore Ditch?
  - (my best guess is): he offers falstaffe a vagina or poop-shute
- falstaffe: Thou hast the most vnsauoury smiles, and art in-deed the most comparatiue rascallest sweet yong Prince. But Hal, I prythee trouble me no more with vanity, I wold thou and I knew, where a Commodity of good names were to be bought: an olde Lord of the Councell rated me the other day in the street about you sir; but I mark'd him not, and yet hee talk'd very wisely, but I regarded him not, and yet he talkt wisely, and in the street too.
  - not sure. I think the mark'd him not bit is probably something saying by falstaffe "no homo"
- prince: Thou didst well: for no man regards it.
  - no man regards sexual favours? I don't get it
- falstaffe: O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeede able to corrupt a Saint. Thou hast done much harme vn-to me Hall, God forgiue thee for it. Before I knew thee Hal, I knew nothing: and now I am (if a man shold speake truly) little better then one of the wicked. I must giue o-uer this life, and I will giue it ouer: and I do not, I am a Villaine. Ile be damn'd for neuer a Kings sonne in Chri-stendome.
  - falstaffe(?) forgives hal for trying to corrupt him (and others)
  - falstaffe started out knowing nothing, though (because of his attempts to corrupt him?), now he's a little better than one of the "wicked".
  - falstaffe needs to give over his life of villany, and he will...
  - but he does not because he is a villian.
  - he's going to be damn'd for (don't understand)
- prince: Where shall we take a purse to morrow, Iacke?
  - this "purse" is lowercase.
- falstaffe: Where thou wilt Lad, Ile make one: and I doe
not, call me Villaine, and baffle me.
  - wherever you want to take a purse. I'll make a purse: and I do not [have a purse], call me villian and "baffle" me.
  - sounds like falstaffe doesn't have a "purse", so he's going to make one? and then it sounds sexual.
  - why would he make a purse that's just going to take?
- prince: I see a good amendment of life in thee: From
Praying, to Purse-taking.
  - Praying = blowjobs, so I guess Purse-taking is something else.
- falstaffe: Why, Hal, 'tis my Vocation Hal: 'Tis no sin for a
man to labour in his Vocation.
  - not sure what is his vocation...
- pointz: Now shall wee know if Gads hill haue set a
Watch. O, if men were to be saued by merit, what hole
in Hell were hot enough for him? This is the most omni-
potent Villaine, that euer cryed, Stand, to a true man.
  - I'm inclined to believe that Purse-taking is something homosexual, because I see often times the reference to crying and stuff.. like, there was this one question that seriah asked on the show about a why a guy would have his pants down and crying, and there was awkward silence. I don't know if crying is a common thing or something, but shakespere says tears a lot too... so I dunno. at any rate, I'd like to stay completely away from that stuff, so I dunno.
  - it's interesting to note that his name here is "pointz", as in "point", and the poines is the goddess of punishment and retribution. I also get the sense of regret as well, cause of the next line...
- poines: Good morrow sweet Hal. What saies Mon-sieur Remorse? What sayes Sir Iohn Sacke and Sugar: Iacke? How agrees the Diuell and thee about thy Soule, that thou soldest him on Good-Friday last, for a Cup of Madera, and a cold Capons legge?
  - it sounds to me like poines is chiding hal about his interaction with jack because of the remorse bit and how he says that he sold his soul to the devil (another epithet for falstaffe )
