## THOUGHT TOPICS

### earth shaking

- earth shakes when glendower is born.
- heaven was full of firey metal ships/shapes
- hotspur explains that the earth shook not because of his birth, but because the earth desires at times to enlarge herself, breakes things and shakes.
- tim says it's prophetic, though hotspur and glendower are talking in past tense.
- also strange the difference between nativity and birth -- though, I thought them to be the same.

Glend. At my *Natiuitie*, The front of Heauen was *full of fierie shapes*, Of burning *Cressets*: and at my *Birth*, The frame and foundation of the *Earth Shak'd like a Coward*.
Hotsp. Why so it would haue done at the same season, if your Mothers Cat had but kitten'd, though your selfe had neuer beene borne.

Glend. I say the *Earth did shake* when I was borne.
Hotsp. And I say the *Earth was not of my minde*, If you suppose, as fearing you, it shooke.

Hotsp. Oh, then the *Earth shooke* To see the Heauens on fire, And *not in feare of your Natiuitie*. Diseased Nature oftentimes breakes forth In strange eruptions; and the teeming Earth Is with a kinde of Collick pincht and vext, By the imprisoning of vnruly Winde Within her Wombe: which for enlargement striuing, Shakes the old Beldame Earth, and tombles downe Steeples, and mosse-growne Towers. At your Birth, Our Grandam Earth, hauing this distemperature, In passion shooke.

### conjure spirits vs tell truth

- glendower can conjure spirits from the deep
- hotspur doesn't think much of it, because so can everyone else -- but will they actually come when you call them?
- glendower claims to also be able to teach hotspur to be able to command the Devil (saturn?).
- hotspur: yeah, so! I can teach you to *shame* the devil by telling the truth. go ahead and conjure the devil from below and I'll shame him back to where he came from.

### no idea what this means

(but seems important...)

Mort. My Father *Glendower is not readie yet*, Nor shall wee neede his helpe these foureteene dayes: Within that space, you may haue drawne together Your Tenants, Friends, and neighbouring Gentlemen.
Glend. A shorter time shall send me to you, Lords: And *in my Conduct shall your Ladies come*, From whom you now must steale, and take no leaue, For there will be a *World of Water* shed, Vpon *the parting of your Wiues* and you.

- ladies come & parting of your wives:
  - in the distance or sexual sense?
- why no need for glendower's help?
- why is this being talked about after dividing the land into three sections: england, wales, and scotland
  - glendower is a torrent
  - england is two rivers
  - mortimer is south and east
  - west is wales beyond the serene(?) river shore
  - it looks like hotspur gets moiety/middle, glendower the north, and mort must then have the remiaining lower(?)
  - therefore if glendower is northmost, it's the one not ready yet for fourteen days (2 weeks, 4-teen days?)
    - if the south is earth, the middle is the ionosphere, then is glendower's north the 2nd ray upper most layer? which causes the earth to expand?
- it feels to me like these three are dividing the sections (but I'm unclear on which ones):
  - 7th, 5th, 3rd?
  - 5th, 3rd, 1st?
  - 2nd, 4th, 6th?
    - this seems most plausible because transition layers have currents, eddies and behave a lot like rivers of charged particles. 2nd ray would also be pretty torrentlike, where as I wouldn't describe 1st or 3rd as torrent-like (chaos, and ordered/synchronised symmetry/perspective)

### mortimer defeats glendower in battle

- mortimer the welsh marches on glendower
- leaves Hilfordshifee
- to confront glendower for his irregular and wilde behaviour
- 1000 of glendower's army are "butchered"
- (upon their dead corpses), there was:
  - such misuse
  - such *beastly* and *shameless* **transformation**
- it should not be:
  - spoken about (without much shame)
  - re-told
  - spoken of.
- therefore, let's go to the Holy Land

### time problems

- I figure: one month (in this play) is roughly equivalent to one trip around the sun/moon (depending on your perspective)
    - I make this claim because it talks about glendower *not* being ready for another 14 years, -- and so if I calculate from 2024 (the peak of the solar cycle conside), that adds to 2038, my supposed time limit -- therefore, I feel like this is giving somewhat of a guideline, not for like literal use
    - you can imagine my perspective where I would want to *see* all of these images, but because I don't actually *see* them, but instead "see" them
    - (which I like and wantt to continue doing)
    - these *answers* to my questions
    - cause, you know I have tons and tons of questions about a lot of stuff that's a secret
    - have to come to me,
    - instead of a visual form, but
    - in a physical form
    - which is best found in the creativity of others.
    - because I can't *see*
    - the way that I receive information is from others
- threfore what we're doing is we're figuring out how to get glendower all setup, and that's it.


- 1 month = 1 earth year
- 1 day = (I have no idea)
- 1 hour = (I have no idea)
- thme time of day also puzzles me, because it says something in hour of day
  - (I'm also probably assuming standard 7/24/60/3600 clock as well)

#### 2023-03-22 17:25 - so, am I altering the past?

I believe so. the points in time that have such enlighttenment have people much more in the receoptive mode; they're receiving ideas from the "subconscious" more soure-like aspect of you, -- because when writing and being creative, it's a lot easier to just let thoughts flow. I just receive ideas all day long, and so that results in an incredible amount of creativity.

the thing is, we receive ideas through the lens of our concepts. it's exactly like how the eye works, where you see what you want to see. when we're feeling good, we're receiving ideas that feel really good, and so that's why I'm so massively creative; it's *simply* my capacity to feel good no matter the circumstances

you know, it's my greatest advantage, because the more I have pushing against me, the more energy I have to work with. it *also* allows me to manifest my ideas into reality; it's not really a story reality, but a discovery reality. I just get new ideas all the time, and so by just following those, things go well for me.

you know, there's an interesting thing about the frequency of a concept, because it's got a spectrum of realisation. the more people that experience it, the more intense the vibration it is (amplitude), but novel realisations of a concept (that is, manifestations), are always added to it's spectrum of reality.

in practicality, you'll notice that if I say something to someone in a very angry or condescending way, then that manifestation is the reality that person has tuned into, so they'll get one response from me, meanwhile others, tuned into a higher frequency on the manifestation spectrum, get a different response from me.

what that means, is that I can shout soumething really terrible at someone, but if they're tuned in to a higher frequency, they'll hear/understand/(get the same manifestation) that corresponds to where they're tuned into the spectrum.

therefore, *we all see what we want to see*, in the end, and so I always have control to find a way to see what I want to see; nobody can take tchat from me.

#### 2023-03-22 17:41 - how do we influence the past?

be allowing it to be different. I don't really have an axe to grind about what our history is. for all I know, we all *could* actually be in a different solar system even, not even experiencing what earth experiences.

imagine for a moment that the entire setup in just a big shell, and we're living in a shell society -- a sort of "truman's world" in the lyra solar system.

so imagine for a moment that all aspects of the government, politics, and all of that is just a sham run by (essentially) satans satyrs (or something equally ridiculous), and so we live entirely in a sort of *show*; entertainment for the viewers, wherever they are.

you know, cause like, wouldn't it be hilarious if you all, as a reflection of me, are also in a big show (lol). that'd be hilarious.

the past is whatever you want it to be necessary to arrive to the present: terence, a bold pioneer in this idea, found it plausible that he could have descended from shamanistic monkeys. I thought that was kind of an interesting way to perceive to look at the past. he sees the male dominiance hierarchy to be something that the monkeys had in them already pre-built.

however, if the monkeys had male dominance hierarchies, was that an emergent property of a naturally evolving monkey (or whatever that came from). it gets complicated.

I prefer to think that our DNA is a reflection of perception, so I don't need LSD or any other drug to alter my DNA -- but instead think that our DNA (minus the machinery) is always changing, and that's what's causing us to look like we do.

one nice thing about being a cascading hierachy of biological robots, we try to organise our social and whatever institutions to behave like we want our machines (our bodies) to behave: as programmed.

we see the external things as machinations and programs just like a computer programmer sees code. if the red one is performing better (think of a program), you use that one -- and apparently (somehow) male dominance hierarcry was more successful (for some reason).

I find male domenance of no particular use, as it's no different than wanting to use the program that functions better. I simply keep looking for better and better program, so nothing even has he looking at dominance anymore -- because it's not even on my radar.

dominance is such an obsoleted idea for me, because I think only in terms of attraction, and seeing dominance (in any way shape or form), is only a reflection of my own desire to dominate. meaning, that I'll only see it, if I'm desiring or perceiving dominance in others.

as such, I don't compete with othes, because it's not a good point of attraction for me.

the easiest way to not compete with others is to remain solo.

I know that as soon as I get around others that allow me to perceive some of these undesirable attributes like greed, hate, dominance, etc. then I manifest them really strongly.

I'm literally a disaster waiting to happen (with the speed at which concepts and emotions turn to reality).

are you ready to crash and burn with me? I'm not. I'm really not ready. therefore, one of the interesting things about this play is it gives a focal point to look at.

from there, I'm sure that my concepts of reality will reveal new stuff all the time.

as a reflection of the world, it feels like I'm the collective manifestation of the world's artistic and creative efforts (within my concept of what's possible), just like you are -- and so all you have to do to let yourself start to become like the congealed dreams (and nightmares) into narrative form

and so, you are tuned into that narrative sectrum already, and so the symbols are all the same, but we see what we want to see. we experience reality as that reflection of our concept of it.

it seems quite possible to me that somehow, we experience the lyra reality, as well as the earth one.

in fact, it seems like there's the perspectivce (probably the one that comes from the simultaneous lyra perspective)

which means that normally, most people's inner world perspective is a total nightmare (cause that's how it is for their "real-life" self in lyra), and so most people *only* want to see the (better) earth perspective.

I however seem to have found a way to feel better and better, such that my lyra connection is way better than the earth one. kenny sees earth one. nosebook sees lyra one and take advantage of it because it's higher frequency.

it's a very interesting thing, because this creates a triad, where your "source" is the reflector, and then the physical body is the actor, and the lyra conuterpart is the charactor.

as such, having being stuck in the actor's perspective by nosebook has been an immense boon for me. so much so, that I wish to permanently make it part of my genetics. meaning, I really like just seeing earth's perspective. the lyra one doesn't really matter to me, so it's all good to me to not see that one. I just be earthly physical me.

I wonder if others would want to do the same? I want to create "offspring" (if you will), of kenny, not kenneth. in addition to this, I want to find a way to make it possible for others to live with me without an inner reality -- meaning that we will become the physical reflectors of the physical.

this play I think is about changing the past, and looking at itt differently, because it doesn't matter anyway, andyou could have gotten to the present however you believe you needeed too get here to experiece this. lol
