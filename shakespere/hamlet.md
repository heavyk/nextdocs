### 2022-09-21 23:37 - the way that he says it is the comedy

"take thy fair hour layrties ..." when he said that, I really found it very funny, even though I couldn't figure out what he was saying. when I looked into it, I realised that those characters exist in a really funny and good-feeling place (concept), and so just by saying it properly (probably with the right rhythm), I tuned into that a moment and the location of that conecpt is what's really funny.

not sure how to explain, but I'm sure that it's not going to be hard to tune into the original concept (you can tell when the rhythm and tone are right), and then you can see the comedy (or tragedy) from his eyes. tragedy in those eyes is really hilarious, but inside of the perspective of the character, it's tragic.

imagine how different a story it would be if the author is constantly *inside* of the character he's playing. he sees the whole "movie" unfold from first person perspective.

if what's there that I expect will be there, that means that shakespere perfected the 3rd person perspective, and so a very obvious trend change in story telling will be done from the 1st person (desire) perspective. it may already be here. I may be that herald. it's a change in perspective.

### 2022-09-22 00:26 - methinks I see my father

I've often bellieved that de vere (and bacon et al) had a form of conceptual perspective (5d). I think it was just these guys and some troubadors, but they probably had 5d perspective, so they all saw their characters in 3d space and talked and interacted with them as if they were real people. but watching real people say such dramatic and ridiculous things is hilarious.

it occurs to me that hamlet, is the "puppetmaster" for the "ghost" of his father, because with a 5d perspective, you can conjure images "in your mind's eye" to project down into 4d, where people with astral (4d) can interact with them. I say this because when reading hedayat the beginning part of the story he's starting a phychedellic trip, and then the rain and mist prevented a dispersed/foggy manifestation because of a lack of focus (hallucinations, etc), the strong emotion that he felt focused the manifestation to appear as this wonderful woman that he had to cut to pieces. he was interacting with "astral" matter, which is far greater of an effect that "shakespere" had than hedayat had, because hedayat had the full sensory experience (and not just a ghost).

it makes me wonder if the play is going to be about his "ghost" father somehow merges with reality, the foundation of dee's work with the enochian tablets. cause if that's true, this is the precursor to egrigore summoning.

it also means that the whole rest of the story (of which I noticed a few jesus references), was just a stage magician meanwhile an egregore is being installed into reality.

I'll keep watching.

AH, by getting horacio to believe that the ghost is "real". makes sense.

### 2022-09-26 11:15 - ideas on the characters

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8gx2A5Q53c&list=PLIlatssdqY5PbkXkQyvFVTaDUd8LC_4vo&index=2)

as he's talking about the characters in the play, I finally see it. so king hamlet of danmark is symbolic of jesus. this I think is a way to dupe people symbolically into believing a different thing happened.

so, just to back up, I subscribe to the thing that terence saw where he saw that on one timeline jesus was successful, but on the other one, the demiurge took over the jesus' timeline. I've since learned that is one way to look at another concept I call self-sabotage. therefore, the way that I look at it, jesus was successful in the timeline, but in order for the "demiurge" to show up and take over jesus' body at the end, one must self-sabotage.

for jesus, that was to essentially remove all of his positive influence on society by the introduction of more "demiurge" egregores and such (for example what I think the antarctic breakaway civilisation is, amongst other things). in short, to self-sabotage, you have to essentially create a demiurge version of yourself. this creates the counter-balance for the novelty in the form of anti-novelty.

so, what I'm seeing in the setup of the characters is that the rennaissance was a high point in culture were they could merge their timeline with ours, as long as there are enough anti-novelty producers. these anti-novelty producers constructed the mechanistic materialistic realities that we're in now. in order to do that, old king hamlet died, and fortenbro has to take over the thing.

now, if you read this in the context of devere as hamlet and that the tudor dynasty is the last of the group decended from the ham (black maddona, the dark woman). and so by elizabeth not allowing the progeny of the tudor/ham dynasty to continue rulership, I think devere moved that form of perception into something that is transferred between men and has initiation rites to it.

on the symbolic level this is the beginning of the descent into pure materialism, where the feminine force is no longer needed. devere and the cathedral builders wanted to spread that feminine (emotional) energy all over the planet. it's also a self-sabotage on many of these others parts. each time you self-sabotage, you do so by creating your own nemesis to defeat your efforts, until you're no longer able to de defeated by yourself. OK, you don't want spirit? let's go full materialism then, here you go, how's decarte?

---

OK, now let's look at the characters now that we can see that this story is a symbolic bridge between two timelines. on one side you have hamlet (black madonna/puma dynasty) and you have fortenbro from norway (the white). hamlet is black and dan is red (I'm saying it like this, so that you can see the resonances with WW1/WW2), and the black/red one has died (5d conceptual entity) but an appartion of him (4d) can be seen by the people when they get told the story about him. this required to get the (materislistic) scholars to believe in something that isn't material (until he is, of course). the more that he is described, the more this apparition becomes real. they're essentially summoning an egregore here.

so now, keep that in mind, because devere (I believe) and bacon had a huge influence on the KJV and the summoning of the future egregore of this millenial christ.

so look at it this way ham/puma dies and now has to be resummoned, but instead of just as an apparition (like jesus was said to have appenared to the apostles, or completely as images, according to steiner), so so if you combine steiner's work with hamlet, you'll see that they're now summoning this spirit in *everyone* rathar than just the appropriate bloodline/DNA type -- and the way that they're bypassing the genetic barriers (phsical) is appealing to us on a symbolic (belief) way, and so that if sufficient belief+desire (expectation), then the egregore will appear (as everyone), cause it's just a story; it's novel folklore. you create and then summon your own archetypes through the symbolic telling of stories.

### characters

the backdrop is that there is an increase in armourments between the two nordic countries (black is about to fight red)

-  (old) king hamlet of danmark
  - king of danmark.
  - defeats fortenbro in battle but then later dies in his garden.
- (young) prince hamlet of danmark
  - acts like a teenager but is about 30yo
  - does not get the throne. instead his uncle (king hamlet's brother claudius) gets the throne.
- king claudius of danmark
  - brother of king hamlet.
  - for some reason the son of king hamlet is not the king, but instead claudius is.
  - king of norway.
  - seen by (young) king fortenbro as the weak link
  - writes to old norway to tell him to get (young) fortenbro in line.

- (old) king fortenbro of norway
  - lost a lot of property and took a lot of damage from (old) king hamlet.
- (young) king fortenbro of norway
  - wants to restore the powerful name (of his father/country/corporation), so he wants to put denmark down a size
  - has an uncle old norway
- old norway
  - impotent and bedrid
  - really runs the country

- lairties
  - ready to go to school (become a scholar)
  - just needs the coronation

- horacio
  - young scholar that knows latin and will talk to the ghost of king hamlet.
  - scholars (the educated) don't believe in ghosts.
  - horacio is also introduced into the scene as if he is already one of these sorts of schollarly egregores:
    - he's only here in material body (a piece of him), but the rest (conscious part) of him is gone somewhere else.

### interesting things to note

- the ghost of king hamlet (black madonna) disappears when the cock crowed.
  - if I combine this with steiner's ideas, you'll notice that the cock crowing was a pinnacle moment, because up until peter was unable to recognise jesus. jesus did not look the same enough for peter to be able to recognise him. I see the "betrayal" event as the beginning of the apparition of king hamlet", and so it's symbolic of the beginning of a *new day* (solar reference) and also the apparition of king hamlet (what we thought was jesus/hamlet/devere) will fade away the beginning of the new day (when the cock crows). it's a full day of spiritual darkness where we only see the material, and no longer the spiritual (true/conceptual essence of the thing).
  - on chrismas, the cock crows all night long and so therefore no ghosts (king hamlet) can appear on those days.
    - not quite sure what this means, but if I had to guess, I would say it has to do with belief. on christmas, we believe in things like santa claus or other such things, and so on those days, what we believe is real.
      - I'm sorta reminded of a the-tick episode where the static electricity santas are causing trouble, so tick has to find a way to get others to believe that santa *is* real, so that he can get rid of the static electricity (egregore) santas.
- prince hamlet describes his depression with the world as an un*weeded* garden.
  - why would you want to *weed* your garden?
  - he describes denmark (red) as a garden that does not yet have enough weeds in it, that *turns to seed* (I think this is a temporal marker, "prophesying" that the red ones turn to seed, being unable to make king the black one (hamlet)). this, I believe describes future events where more of the red ones become as like weeds (these are oportunistic reproducers that thrive in difficult environments). with the obvious end goal to be to use that seed as the germination poing of the return into corporeal form (old) king hamlet.
  - another thing to note is that in the same speech he explains the other half of that as his mother's sudden swich over from king hamlet to claudius. so, if the female bloodline is the source of this perception, then gertrude switching over to claudius is the way that those (female bloodline) seeds are sown.
- king hamlet is the successful one and claudius is the demiurge that prepares everyone for the reappearance of king hamlet.
- in the same way fortenbro is the successful one and old uncle norway is the demiurge (both hamlet and fortenbro self-sabotaged)


### hyperion and satyr vs hamlet and claudius

I find it interesting in this analogy that hamlet is contrasted with hyperion, which was one a *titan* (like prometheus), and also she's a woman (actually, I just looked on wikipedia and it says that hyperion is saturn's *brother*, but I thought she was like diana, associated with hunting). anyway, claudius is compared with hamlet in the analogy as a goatman (capricornus), the christmas diety, but is androgynus and doesn't have a gender. also considered a trickster. IMO, this is the way that skakespere is kind of setting up that claudius is the demiurge installed by king hamlet himself to turn the garden (which he died in) into weeds.

before the shoes that she wore to the funeral got scuffs on them, she's already making out with claudius. this reminds me of cinderella story for some reason (as in, the opposite of cinderella: marriage/funeral, shoes)

prince hamlet says, king claudius is no more like my father than I am to hercules. prince hamlet is relating himself with hercules, you know the guy with the 12 labours (around the zodiac), the mithras type figure that turns the celestial clock.

this is further reinforced with the idea that king hamlet passes on the torch to hercules, but claudius passes on the torch to prince hamlet.

### lairties, ophelia, and polonius

lairties, his sister ophelia, and his father polonius. it's important to note that hamlet/denmark foght wars against norway and poland. therefore poland is the ooposite to norway. we have a few triads here. the main triad is norway-denmark-poland with each part represented by theirselves yfortenbro-ofortenbro-norway, yhamlet-ohamlet-claudius, lairties-ohelia-polonius (respectively).

I also would like to mention that the name polonius, though is obviously a reference to poland, also reminds me significantly of pluto/hades, which is also hercules' uncle. so just keep this in mind when we're talking about pluto, his sister ophelia may have something to do with selene, but I'm not yet sure of her significance. ophelia also reminds me of persephone/proserpina.

anyway, in the conversation with prince hamlet, ophelia tells hamlet to:

    Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
    Whiles, like a puffed and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
    And recks not his own rede.

- don't be like the ungracious pastors
  - pastors are references to the kings in sumerian times. the pastored the field
    - this was a big deal during the transition from nomadic (hunter gatherer) type people to agrarian, where now the people are plowed and sown into rathar than herded around like flock.
    - this is a contrast to prince hamlet that did not get the king/pastor position
- *don't* show me (ophelia) the thorny and bumpy path to heaven
  - pastors lead their flock, so she's saying that prince hamlet will lead her to heaven, but don't she doesn't want the uncomfortable route there.
- whiles, like a puffed and reckless libertine
  - wiley is very anxious and free (supporting the libertine description)
  - whiles means taking a long time, waiting -- a foot dragger.
  - puffed and reckless is a sort of hawty or hotshot attitude to the issue,
- (hamlet) himself, the shining example of a dilly-dallier on the path (he travels the road slowly, foot dragger)
- and still manages not to wreck not his own reed
  - (zech, rev): "and I was given a reed as unto a measuring stick so that I might measure the dimensions of heaven"

so here we have hamlet comparisoning himself to hercules, and all kind of other symbolism that corresponds pretty well.
