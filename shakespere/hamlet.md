"take thy fair hour layrties ..." when he said that, I really found it very funny, even though I couldn't figure out what he was saying. when I looked into it, I realised that those characters exist in a really funny and good-feeling place (concept), and so just by saying it properly (probably with the right rhythm), I tuned into that a moment and the location of that conecpt is what's really funny.

not sure how to explain, but I'm sure that it's not going to be hard to tune into the original concept (you can tell when the rhythm and tone are right), and then you can see the comedy (or tragedy) from his eyes. tragedy in those eyes is really hilarious, but inside of the perspective of the character, it's tragic.

imagine how different a story it would be if the author is constantly *inside* of the character he's playing. he sees the whole "movie" unfold from first person perspective.

if what's there that I expect will be there, that means that shakespere perfected the 3rd person perspective, and so a very obvious trend change in story telling will be done from the 1st person (desire) perspective. it may already be here. I may be that herald. it's a change in perspective.

I've often bellieved that de vere (and bacon et al) had a form of conceptual perspective (5d). I think it was just these guys and some troubadors, but they probably had 5d perspective, so they all saw their characters in 3d space and talked and interacted with them as if they were real people. but watching real people say such dramatic and ridiculous things is hilarious.

it occurs to me that hamlet, is the "puppetmaster" for the "ghost" of his father, because with a 5d perspective, you can conjure images "in your mind's eye" to project down into 4d, where people with astral (4d) can interact with them. I say this because when reading hedayat the beginning part of the story he's starting a phychedellic trip, and then the rain and mist prevented a dispersed/foggy manifestation because of a lack of focus (hallucinations, etc), the strong emotion that he felt focused the manifestation to appear as this wonderful woman that he had to cut to pieces. he was interacting with "astral" matter, which is far greater of an effect that "shakespere" had than hedayat had, because hedayat had the full sensory experience (and not just a ghost).

it makes me wonder if the play is going to be about his "ghost" father somehow merges with reality, the foundation of dee's work with the enochian tablets. cause if that's true, this is the precursor to egrigore summoning.

it also means that the whole rest of the story (of which I noticed a few jesus references), was just a stage magician meanwhile an egregore is being installed into reality.

I'll keep watching.

AH, by getting horacio to believe that the ghost is "real". makes sense.
