"take thy fair hour layrties ..." when he said that, I really found it very funny, even though I couldn't figure out what he was saying. when I looked into it, I realised that those characters exist in a really funny and good-feeling place (concept), and so just by saying it properly (probably with the right rhythm), I tuned into that a moment and the location of that conecpt is what's really funny.

not sure how to explain, but I'm sure that it's not going to be hard to tune into the original concept (you can tell when the rhythm and tone are right), and then you can see the comedy (or tragedy) from his eyes. tragedy in those eyes is really hilarious, but inside of the perspective of the character, it's tragic.

imagine how different a story it would be if the author is constantly *inside* of the character he's playing. he sees the whole "movie" unfold from first person perspective.

if what's there that I expect will be there, that means that shakespere perfected the 3rd person perspective, and so a very obvious trend change in story telling will be done from the 1st person (desire) perspective. it may already be here. I may be that herald. it's a change in perspective.
