# sonnets presention ideas

- make pyramid of sonnets
  - make subjects that appear in the sonnets
    - so for example, I'll have "garden of eden" symbols, then show references to eyes, eating, YHVH, dieing, etc. (show them in different colours so they become visual)
  - add in my own interpretations for them (probably line-by-line)
