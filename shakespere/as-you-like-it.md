rosalind - the female component of ganemede (queen hera)
ganymede - the male component of rosalind
celia - best friend of rosalind


#### rosalind

rose is a very important word for shakespere. he was mostcertainnly rosicrucian. to me the name means "holder of the rose"[^1] -- and let's just say the rose is some sort of visual capability that was passed between men through the rose.

we can also deduce that ganymede, as the primary "cup-bearer" for zeus is "queen hera" -- aka haephestus/vulcan.

[1]: turns out I learned later it means "nice butthole" lol, guess I can't get everything right.

#### celia

celia I'm going to probably guess is aphrodite, or the 7th ray shape-shifting female that shows up. I don't feel like she has such an intense role here, so I wonder if her shape-shifting qualities will alter any trajectories.
