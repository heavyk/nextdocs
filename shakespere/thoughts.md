# thoughts on shakespere

nothing too specific to any one of his works.

### 2022-10-03 14:30 - future past

yesterday I had a conversation with dad about shakespere where I was explaining that it's likely that quite a few ideas found in shakespere's plays must have been inspired by real events. to demonstrate, I used a combination of hamlet and midsummer's night dream to show that it's likely that the heir to the throne was userped (by claudius in hamlet) and that the king james figure (who commissioned the 1611 bible) was quite possibly this guy. the reason why I belive it's "hamlet" is because ham refers to one of noah's son's ham. consider that noah, being the survivor of the cataclysm is the origin of "aryan" root-race, and so his sons symbolically have the colours black (ham), red (shem), and white (japheth). you'll notice the egyptian colours there, as the "gods" of egypt were white guys (see nearly every ropert sepehr for further elaboration on this). you'll also notice that these are the nazi party's colours as well -- again, with the idea that they're going to create an aryan master race. because the nazi party invested so much in archeology, I don't believe those colours or the swastika were an accident.

at any rate, he's called hamlet, because he comes from the black bloodline. the knights templar (after digging around below solomon's temple) introduced the "black madonna" symbolism into europe and suddenly there are a lot of cathedrals being built being commissioned by the catholic church. the "ancient romans" (as horatio calls himself), are the main opposition to expanded consciousness, and this is likely the reason for the sudden halting of cathedral building. denmark is an obvious reference to red and the serepent which, in the garden of eden, opened their eyes.

I believe there is another reference to the colour of white with hamlet telling polonius that he is jephthah (from judges 11) sacrificing his daughter, because that also appears in another play as well when clarence takes the rose out of his hat and throws it at warwick. the red cross or rose is always in the centre while the white surrounds it (the nazi flag kinda inverts this, with black back in the centre). so, this is potentially a symbolic message to polonius that poland (polar land) is actully the outer part, rathar than the centre. seems it's done on purpose.

queen elizabeth, the last of the tudor dynasty, was I beleve to be considered to be the last of the black maddona bloodline. this is important because if that's the case she's the living representative of diana (the aryan goddess). you see, the aryan (7th ray) triad is genxicat (black condor, puma) symbolised by the colour black, mars obviously is the red one, leaving vulcan to be the white one. here's another example of a reference to black (from phoenix (red) and turtle poem). notice how the priests are white, the phoenix is never labeled, but if the phoenix is the red one, then it'll be mars, the red empires that keep rebuilding theirselves after another disasters. the priests are the white ones in the outer court (remember solomon's temple has outer court, inner court, and the centre (holy of holies)). emphasis mine:

    Let the priest in surplice *white*,
    That defunctive music can,
    Be the death-divining *swan*,
    Lest the requiem lack his right.

    And thou treble-dated *crow*,
    That thy *sable* gender mak'st
    With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st,
    'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.

notice how the nazi party's flag inverts this, and relegates the red ones (shemites) out into the outer courts, while puting the black back into the middle? OK, hopefully I've made my case that I believe the colours and symbols in shakespere's works *are* purposeful.

I believe the names and things are also quite purposeful as well. for example, in midsummer's night dream, there is an "indian king", which is likely the changling child that the "virgin queen" had, but because she never publically had this child, to keep off the spanish invasion, the in-diane king never was given his right to the throne. it's my belief that this black bloodline's form of perception transformed, no longer being passed genetically through the female bloodline, I think this became transferred from one male initiate to another in these secret builders guilds and the rosicrucians (which became the masons). rosencrantz and guild-en-stern are namely puns on that (he who has ears to hear, knows what I'm talking about). there's a reason why the church (ancient romans) cracked down on the templars and their homosexuality.

---

so, what does all of that mean, and why am I fascinated by it? the reason why is because we attract our reality with feeling and symbols. at a future time I'll try to explain the process in greater detail (dad had to go to the restroom yesterday), but just know that by playing these plays, we're attracting those sorts of symbols into our reality. the other major effect that it has, and the one I believe was the intention of shakespere was to have us give attention to these symbols, thereby amplifying them.

the other day I did this and I made a big point out of it. I announced to mom that I had figured out that sesily didn't wish to pay me because I was going to buy more drugs with it. she thought that I was saying that to try and affect behaviour by pointing it out, forcing them to have to pay me, but I stated from the very beginning that this was not the case. I just wanted to amplify the problem. I believe that shakespere was/is using the same technique that I was using.

he must have known that writing about the ridiculousness of these kingly positions is not actually going to cause them to change their behaviour. in fact, the (rather significant) evidence that john anthony and alan green have shown of the influence that shakespere had on the king james bible, means that, (in the context of what I wrote about above), through king james and his 1611 (authorised) bible, he helped reestablish the ancient romans back into power in the form of the catholic church.

considereing the following 30y war and a number of other events, it is my opinion that these builders guilds and shakespere were heavily invested in giving the roman church the tools that it needed to maintain its power structure for quite a while longer until the next "honey pot" could be built for them to go into and infiltrate, which is the future establishment of the USA.

roughly speaking, I've recognised a series of forces that seems to continue its efforts, spanning across multiple generations. I've called both the good and bad ones the "fallen-angels". the reason for this is that at the end of their life they don't die, but instead move around inside of the astral realm looking for a new body to inhabit. the common thread between them is that all of these guys have "expanded vision" (4d), are symbolically very aware (probably because of faster LOA), and have a very capable imagination. they also entertain secrets, because their own longer view on human history they have to even keep a secret. this is why you only hear about unexperienced people talking about astral travel when they first discover it, but then seem to go silent about it after that. both of them (the good and bad ones) also have a consistent history of trying to improve or inhibit expanded perception of humankind using *conditions*.

the major change that shakespere does, is to make it no loger about conditions (who controls the temple mount, cathedrals, pyramids, etc.) but now it's all about emotion. now, you *are* your emotion, and the church's effort to monopolise all of the spiritual aspects, left the rest of society to flail about in the drama that the new emotional reality takes place. (you can now see vulcan's 5th ray effect here, played out through the 7th rays: aries and the black madonna).

so, if I'm going to put a label on these different secret societies and other such things, I'd say that they're trying to help and to keep humankind from destroying itself. it looks like it's been orchestrated and planned out by someone that knows something about LOA. consider now that they would have built all of the major cathedrals, and that we know the USA was established mostly by the masons[^1], it seems that this is an effort to kind of move these "ancient romans" out of europe and into the USA. I'm sure there are still some decrepit births still happening in the roman catholic church, but it's much more likely most of the power mongers have moved over to the USA at this point.

this is quite long. next, I want to talk about attracting with symbols a bit more. I see myself as a bit of a shakespere in the sense that it appears that I'm helping to give them their next 1611 bible, from which they can have all of the power to hold the monopoly on the spiritual realm again.

[1]: I'm not saying all masons are good. it's like a spy ring, and there are good ones and bad ones, but it's been infiltrated and compromised many times over. personally, I'm suprised any of them can make heads or tails of anything -- and so I steer pretty clear from it, because like a spy network, you just can't really trust anything. trust is a very difficult thing to establish and maintain. corruption happens all of the time and the sense that I get from crowley (and parsons) is that you have to kinda find your own way in it all because it's not like someone is just going to give you the power for free... another thing I dislike is the idea that an asymetry of knowledge (secret) is able to give a person power. I believe that *all* knowledge is available, so power is actually your ability to tune to what you want and ignore what everyone else is doing.

### 2023-03-16 21:11 - duke of milain

- duke of milain is patron to both ventine and proteus, and father of silvias (two gentlemen of verona)
- prospero and antonio are also dukes of milain (tempest)

### 2023-03-16 21:43 - castor, pollux, and helen

turns out these guys seem to be related. helen always seems to be in a triad with a dual character: castor & pollux, agamemnon & menelaus, or theseus and prithous, or chiron and dioscuri.

### 2023-03-18 01:52 - prospero and psyche

I just now noticed that in "the golden ass" venus/aphrodite has psyche go to get a dose of beauty from venus/diana/prosperina down in the underworld. she opens the box and falls into sleep, which cupid has to save her from.

anyway, why this is important is because I noticed that "prospero" (tempest) is a masculine version of diana/prosperina/venus -- that's why he's putting cupid/psyche through the trouble: psyche is just the female counterpart to cupid; they're the same -- she's just a manifestation of his mind.

oh right, the masculine version of diana is already apollo... he's probably a manifestation of her mind/symbols (or, the other way around). didn't think about that.

### 2023-03-18 03:01 - laertes

I just noticed that laertes is a mix of "[lares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lares)", meaning lord -- and "[penates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di_Penates)" (houshold deities that guard the inner part of the house); meaning then, that laertes represents the inner court (of denmark?)

### 2023-03-18 03:05 - aeneas future king of trojans/romans

the trojans (red) become the future romans in anead. homer has poseidon save aeneas from achilles, saying that aeneas is destined to become king of trojans. in the aenead I don't think he becomes king though... aeneas decends to the underworld, gets a vision from his father to go found rome. returning from the underworld, lavinia gets offered by latinus to aeneas to become the founder of rome (through his son silvius).

however, in the play "titus andronicus", the ruler of rome is saturninus (connected to the underworld through prosperina). however, due to tamora and aaron's revenge, it's actually lucius that ends up as king of romans/trojans.

so then, if aeneas is the future roman king (something he doesn't accomplish in the aenead), is this shakespere's way of saying that lucius is likened to aeneas?

### 2023-03-18 17:08 - hEro imagery

I've noticed, that most of the coded stuff in shakespere's works (and it looks like marlowe's as well) are hidden underneithe some graphic imagery.

### 2023-03-26 02:30 - 4th T

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eAON2pTe9o)

it occurred to me the other day when watching that video that the 4th T, is likely a reference to hermes trimiguistus(?). he was thrice great, but this next time, he'll be 4 times great. remember that hermes/thoth is magic and writing -- ie. narrative, just like a 2nd ray does. it involves ceremony & ritual (sequences), in addition to words and spells to create an illusion. look no further than shakespere for such an example.

what I think is happening is that I repeatedly see two T's popping up. one I believe is mars, and the other is thoth. the difference between the two is that mars uses desire/creativity/destruction/chaos to accomplish the purpose, meanwhile thoth uses magic and illusion to accomplish the same thing through symbolism *in* a narrative.

narrative is 2nd ray which combines symbolism and desire into a bigger picture, so what you're looking at is two manifestations of the same energy -- however mars' is 2-1-7, meanwhile thoth's is 2-3-7. thoth's energy is channeled through venus/apollo (-3) and saturn/adonis (+-4), and then down into astral; meanwhile, mars' effect passes down to vulcan (-5+) and raven (-7). it creates a nice symmetrical effect.

what this looks like in practicality is basically this: mars works on desire, which is the pure form of the energy, but that energy is so high frequency, it's terrifying to most, and so most people instead want a simple story or narrative that gives a clear binary (good vs evil) that they can adhere to guide their life: the good shepherd. the worthless shepherd does not guide though, and so therefore has the symbol of freedom or liberation -- however, that freedom is *not* found in adherance to the narrative or the ceremony/spell required to accomplish the purpose. instead, freedom is found in realisation of the concept or feeling required to *attract* what is wanted.

the narrative approach tells you what is wanted, and the steps you need to take to get there -- which unfortunately usually favours the rich and so therefore, those steps are impossible to the majority. the 2nd ray not-good-enoughness is the inability to accomplish the narrative or spell, and so those fall short of the goal ("sorry, not good enough!). meanwhile for the desire/emotional/conceptal approach, it takes a different path which is found in understanding/grasping the general concept, and not the allegory found in the spell, narrative, or ceremony (which is just a veiled reference to the concept) -- and those that can't get the concept (not good enough), also create symbol/desire. because the desire/conceptual approach is all attraction, the narrative unfolds in an unpredictable fashion (because it's attracted).

the desire/conceptual one comes first because it forges the path/narrative, when then the symbolism and narrative guys then take and turn into something that one can *do* to accomplish the same thing -- but then, it *also* comes last, for those that can't accomplish the narrative/spell (for whatever reason), anyone can get the concept (if they want to).

the narrative/spell works because of time resonances -- meaning that one sequence of events repeated in history which then gets turned into a narrative (like henry 4, which I'm reading now) which then *attracts* a symbolically similar but very different physical outcome -- which can then be turned into a spell/narrative which then attracts similar results for those following the spell/narrative. back and fourth it goes: symbolism feeding desire, and then desire feeding symbolism (the 2nd ray perspective).

### 2023-03-29 10:50 - the deuil/devil

shakespere's "devil" is none other than the "dual" of the character: in geometry terms, this means that all points reach to the centre of the face of the containing dual.

### 2023-03-29 10:59 - Loue

Loue is pronounced like it sounds, "lo, you". Loue is the discovery (and recognition) of myself in others and other things.

#### 2023-03-29 13:25 - like Cupid

Loue, like Cupid disccovers (and falls in love with) an externalisation of himself, Psyche.

### 2023-03-29 12:03 - haue

I noticed the same thing for the word "haue" -- "ha, you" ("ha" is 3rd-plural had), so it's a self reflction "had you" -- which makes perfect sense when speaking to myself. it doesn't sound good when replacing the word "have" with "had you" -- but the concept "something he/you/I had". (makes sense in my mind anyway...) I'm really glad the word got contracted into "have" with the expansion of the alphabet to include the 'v'.

### 2023-04-04 18:07 - shrewſbury

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/BihuYWnzrIQ?t=1256)

in that picture 19 february (50) days into the new year, salsbury is changed to shrewſbury. this may have been a bit of a jab at the queen: going from the salt of the earth to the shrew of the earth.

as I was writing that above, I could also see the "whore of babylon" image in rev 12. I'm not sure what that means. it's probably relevant Henry "Cute"(?) a circle and shield, and then something with "sôwth" that I cannot see too well. also, notice V-spurs symbol on the bottom as well. edward probably drafted the copy that was printed there.

other strange features:
- the "Enrlislg lords 16--" (where lords also kinda looks like "words").
- "We~Tmpest"
- "ſesbwary 1600"

### 2023-04-04 18:29 - honor vs honour

I noticed a differerence between these two in sonnet 66. honur (with an "uh" sound) is different than honôr (with an "or" sound). it's actually very similar to the difference between color (with an or-sound) and colur (with an uh sound). colur is soft (like blue-green pastels) and color is hard sounding (like orange-red blots).

### 2023-04-04 18:35 - virtue is not the same as vertue

lol; just like a cucumber is not the same as a pickle.
