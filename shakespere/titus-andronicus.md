tamora's two sons, demetrius and chiron are interesting because demetrius is the one given to marriage in msnd, and chiron is a centaur, that normally would be a lusty drunk, but apollo has helped to overcome his beastly nature. these are baked into pies. demetrius is also identified as ethiop, just like aaron.
