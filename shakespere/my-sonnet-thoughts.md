### general sense I get leading to my interpretation

I justg got done reading the first 17 sonnets and it feels to me like I see them entirely differently. in the sections below, I'll put down how I see the sonnets, and like in the [venus and adonis](/shakespere/venus-and-adonis.md) I'll make some assumptions, most notably that it seems like he is transcribing, translating, or putting into verse something that he's receiving from "Time" (saturn). I beleve he sees himself as a young and beautiful version of saturn/demuzi/nergal, which he refers to in that poem as "adonis".

I will also make the assumption that he's writing to me (kenny) personally in the poems.

the general sense that I get is that Time really wants me to have children, but I simply refuse to do so, and so the pleading continues on for a while, but it's to no avail because all of his desire is rooted in deterioration and decay. in various sonnets he talks about renewing my outward appearance with beautfiful maidens and all sorts of stuff like that, urging me to establish an earthly house (bloodline).

somethings apparently go wrong, which is told in the 16th when he says,

    Neither in inward worth nor outward faire
    Can make you liue your ſelfe in eies of men

and so it seems that I choose inner beauty rather than outward beauty, and this prevents the eyes of men to see me. the only way this is possible is if I do what I'm presently in the process of doing, which is going straight to 5d. 5d means I project downward into astral, meaning (probably, not 100% sure) that earthly/physical eyes won't be able to see me, just like most people can't see UFOs. only those with astral will be able to see me.

there's another thing that seems to imply that I have to leave or go another place (sonnet 9):

    Looke what an vnthrift in the world doth ſpend
    Shifts but his place,for ſtill the world inioyes it

and this part (sonnet 12):

    That thou among the waſtes of time muſt goe,

so it seems that I never end up with physical issue. additionally, there is idea that there is astral issue though, and the 17th sonnet states, "Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces."

inbetween there is this whole section on eugenics and sealed children. it sounds to me like something straight out of revelations 8 with a lot of people dying, but the ones that are "sealed" don't get hurt. so it sounds to me like they're using my bodies, and that they are somehow "me" now -- because I've lost "selfe" so it appears we've become a collective...

    O That you were your ſelfe,but loue you are
    No longer yours,then you your ſelfe here liue

remember, these are the sealed ones, the 144k virgin boys that have not been defiled by women (sonnet 12):

    Since ſweets and beauties do them-ſelues forſake,

these guys, (like me) seem to be 5d/4d astral entities. I'm described as never having had anything other than painted counterfits (sonnet 16):

    And many maiden gardens yet vnſet,
    With vertuous wiſh would beare your liuing flowers,
    Much liker then your painted counterfeit:

these painted counterfeits are likely the exterior image that nosebook gives to their astral bodies for people (without astral vision) to see and be able to interact with them.

every time that I refuse to have earthly children, I'm presented with a death and winter wasteland (which is exactly the opposite the extreme summer sun and heat in venus and adonis for his refusal to venus), so I don't think this is describing earth. I take this to mean gaga, the planet described in lbe as being ejected from saturn which became pluto (and I believe remnants of tiamat/jeortau is charon). this is a pretty cool setup if the moon is osiris (+-6-+), cause it makes a perfect triad compliment to the sun (-2) and a perfect environment for the many sealed thoths (the surveyors of the "new earth").

it's described in sonnet 17 as a barren desert and a sort of tomb (with wording that sounds a lot like the great pyramid), but I'd like to tie all of this together because gaga/pluto is the moon that exits saturn and becomes pluto, so if the "wastes of time" is pluto, then it makes a lot of sense the poetic resonance with a description of the great pyramid because the sirians pair thoth with saturn and venus (ie venus and adonis). I've talked a little bit about the 7th ray and the 1st ray triads elsewhere, but this is important: the mars thing also fits the description of the barren desert too, and I believe the referece to vere writing as if he's adonis+aries is precisely the combination that was necessary to produce the 7th/1st ray male of allayandra+anatau.

what all of this means is that it though I don't go for earthly issue, what does end up happening is multiple 7th ray females (genxicat prototype) and many 7th ray males (thoth prototype) become possible with the setup.

### 2022-07-05 03:27 - another look at the garden

[edit: nothing really new here. originally I had an idea that involved a lot more of the garden of eden symbolism: eating, eyes, death, shame (I guess + a few more) which I noticed and I had an interesting way of presenting it as backwards from the garden of eden story. however when I sat down to write it, the original thought left me and I ended up kinda repeating myself. I originally had it in blahblog as well, and it's probably where it belongs because I was essentially rethinking the second half of @[blahblog](2022-07-04 18:06)]

I was laying down thinking about it and there's this parallel with the sonnets and also the garden of eden. again, see the previous section for why I believe he's writing to me personally.

vere is writing as the "I am that I am" (ie YHVH). the interesting thing is that the garden of eden has various names for "God" (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/K_x03O1-MHI?t=3196)) and the one that is discouraging adam and eve from eating from the fruit is YHVH.

OK, now in the @[shakespere/sonnets](sonnet-11), he essentially says that once you reach 40yo, you'll surely die -- just like YHVH said to the woman in the garden, he's also saying, to me?

in the garden of eden, YHVH is saying that if they eat, then their eyes will be opened. eyes are a very common theme in the sonnets (at least the first 17 of them) and the very first one talks about the eyes in the opposite way:

    But thou contracted to thine owne bright eyes,
    Feed'ſt thy lights flame with ſelfe ſubſtantiall fewell,

apparently, this guy's eyes are already quite bright, and have a flame that's fed with self-substantial fuel -- quite the opposite of the garden of eden. this time, it sounds like YHVH wants an heir so that "thereby beauties Roſe might neuer die" (ie. so that the rosicrucians secret society never dies? -- that's how the verse appears to me anyway)

randall just casts some doubt on the idea of YHVH being the infinite creator of the universe, but it seems pretty clear that YHVH is just one of the elohim (gods) there and is the primary opposition to the opening of the eyes of adam and eve. he wants them to remain in paradise -- so then paradise may not have been everything it was made out to be. after they eat from the fruit, then he gets very pissed off and sends them away from the garden -- then drives them out and makes sure they can never return to the garden.

personally, I believe this "garden" is something like the pre-motor cortex (the reptile brain) where everything is nearly instant reaction -- so something like mesmerism or the hypnotic state. it's also the state that channelers go into to translate vibration into something physical like words or sound.

if I look at it as a continuum, the garden is direct access to the conceptual plane of perception. however, most of the time we're not really conscious when we perceive from that plane. for example, this happens every time you sleep and also it's the state that channelers get into. deep hypnotism, especially mesmerism seems to act on this plane and since it's so far out of our realm of consciousness, we don't usually know much of what's happening or remember it. therefore, the tree of knowledge of good and bad seems to me to be something that enables the retention of consciousness in this state of mind.

adam and eve were probably not conscious in that state and only took symbolic orders and commands much like a person under hypnotism. that's the most likely reason that YHVH would want them to stay in the garden, but then after having gained "consciousness" (ie knowledge of good and bad, so the ability to make a decision instead of just taking commands), then now he does NOT want them getting back into that state because if in that state they find the other hemisphere (some call it the right brain), then suddenly everything becomes effortless and they become a physical manifestation of their own perception -- immortal.

so that's what I'm in the process of attaining right now. there's no real stopping me. it's just time and releasing resistance until there isn't anything that can keep me away from feeling that good.

---

essentially what I'm seeing here is that vere is writing this from the future looking back trying to say, "hey dude, make sure to have an heir before you go fully conceptual" -- and I think this is a refrence to the whole bloodline of jesus thing, where supposedly his bloodline has some pretty cool capacities. I don't think I'm from the jesus bloodline though, so everything that I've done to modify my DNA, I've done with my own perception and wasn't something I was born with.

just the same as YHVH telling them they'll surely die, I doubt I'll actually die -- and if I do, that's totally fine with me because I don't think it'll be a problem to get back into the physical pretty easily.

however, in the context that the serpent is the kundalini and most likely related to sex, it appears to be the exact reverse. vere is suggesting that I go to make an heir, which is exactly the way to cause lots of death and destruction. I'll wait until I'm completely non-resistant and then I'll go up naturally.

all in all, I think it's quite a disastrous idea to do the whole thing of trying to make an heir. so this whole narrative seems to me to play out like this...

I become sexually involved before I'm connected and it may retard my progress toward the conceptual for a while but eventually I'll get it and the serpent will strike again (I'm referring to rev 12). michael and his angels will cast down fire and stones at the earth and then humans will have to start over again. it's a good thing they've gotten my heirs though so that they can continue on in the new bloodline and reset the humans back.

I'm not very interested in that, and it's funny reading this because I almost get the sense that not having a cataclysm is *worse* than having one. they need to reset the population and get genetic upgrades and it seems like they're going to go to any effort to get it.

I'm not that concerned about my genetic material being out there as I'm pretty sure there is quite a lot of it. who knows how many shapeshifters and other things are out there either from jesus' bloodline or from my own, but that's not what I'm aiming to avoid. what I'm looking to do, is to *not* have the kundalini rise -- which is why I'm staying away from star-watching and sex (and other things). I figure they'll eventually figure out a way to "trick" me into having sex and producing an heir, but I posit that'll happen in the future and a split will take place when they figure that out.

if I get connected, lots of other people will get connected too, and that'll be what causes the catastrophe. if I want to go toward a reality that doesn't have a catastrophe, that's what I will go towards. they can get as many people they want to believe that a catastrophe is coming all they want and create their own reality (obviously not mine, hence the split) -- and that's totally fine.

---

on that note, I noticed some tremendous resistance (dad called and other things) when I was writing @[blahblog](2022-07-04 18:06), where you can probably feel the difference between before dad called and afterward. before he called I was trying to brainstorm some ideas that were opposite the narrative presented (IMO) in these sonnets, which is that I'm pushed toward producing an heir but that never happens, and so instead ... I think shortly I want to write out my own interpretation of it in full. it's going to take a fair bit of work, but it seems fun.

finally, I'm just not as clear as I normally am for some reason. I also don't really know how to express some of these ideas well.

### 2022-07-17 15:58 - birthday sonnet and eyes

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_QYKw7XmY0)

I got an email from bardcode last night about the video on the calendar encoded into the sonnets. so I looked it up. it's sonnet 94 and 148 (which I just noticed both add to 13).

I looked it up and it seemed familiar to me. earlier that night I felt like I wanted to listen to alan. I watched the one the astronomy of da vinci[^1] so I looked to check out an old bardcode. I wanted to watch the adam apollo one. in the beginning he mentions that sonnet in terms of the eye..

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/8kLiTsndB78?t=696)

> I, no; no, I: for I must nothing be.

this is from pp 40 where king rich[^2] is relinquishing the throne. passing on the kingly mantle.

it's the idea of becoming one becoming the nothing. -- the zero becoming the one and the one becoming the zero.

    In things of great receipt with ease we prove
    Among a number one is reckoned none:
    Then in the number let me pass untold,
    Though in thy store's account I one must be;
    For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold
    That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:

he's basically saying that poving things of great receipt is easier to do when you're nothing rather than something. a king cannot do it. it has to be an ordinary person.

---

so, that's probably important, but it wasn't the part I was looking for... I think this is it:

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/8kLiTsndB78?t=1217)

wait, no adam just says that it has to be looked at from the perspective of the ordinary person... try again.

133:
    Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
    ...
      And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,
      Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.

he's saying he's more than one. he's multiple and some are slaves. they're taken by her (? probably the queen) eye. this is a forshadow of 148 where he says that with lesser eyesight, he won't be blinded by her beauty, instead seeing her faults.

it's they eye (eyesight, vision, clarevoyance) that's the problem, not the "I" -- for if it were "I" that's the problem, in 121 (11x11), he wouldn't have said, "no (0), I (1) am that I (1) am" -- "and they that level at my abuses, reckon up their own" (ie that LOA exists).

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/8kLiTsndB78?t=2086)

now, in this part we're talking about adam's vision of the fractal reality from the very very tiny to very very large all existing inside of his eye.

after that alan brings up hamlet where he's saying that "'I' there's the rub" -- and so he's illustrating shakespere's emphasis on the verb "to be": who am I. who is "I". looking at S133, you may get the sense that "I" is more than one -- and it's the "eye" that makes you think it isn't so -- because, you're looking through them so it has to be "real" that all of these things *I am* looking at, are separate from me and not reflections of my own perception.

[[[23:51 - OK, I was spinning my wheels trying to find where he talked about 148 in that one bardcast and I couldn't find it easily without watching the whole thing again, so I finally gave up. I'm going to resume now, but just freestye it from what I remembered]]]

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaW6Jx_V7Jo)

this one he talks about the eyes in S113 being a reference to the horus myth where set blinds the left eye of horus (I'm basically blind in my left eye) and that struck me as being strange because the the right eye is the sun and the left one is the moon. I believe the moon to be the planetary body that encapsulates osiris and osiris (6), along with jeortau (2) and saturn (4) are all reborn deities. these transition regions are where there's a constant ebb and flow from one to another like the tide or a the surface of sometihng -- as such, at these borders is where the most conflict takes place. someone has to lose position in the constant ebb and flow.

what that means to me is that set *is* osiris. what I believe happened is that osiris, like vere *was* successful, but for whatever reason he doesn't like the outcome, so he goes back and produces a copy of himself with all of his negative aspects to defeat himself. by defeating himself or relinquishing a position of power or authority, he's passing the mantle on to someone else.

this is also the story of adam and eve and of cain and abel. these dualing gods are constantly defeating each other, but they're really the same thing. the alpha and omega, etc. each time the other is defeated a new power regime is put into place. so, in vere's time, the "new atlantis" was sabotaged to no longer be the eden of good conditions.

so, just as osiris and prevented from containing a position of power, we see that vere instead of being defeated, decides instead to relinquish the throne as mentioned by king rich's diagloge on page 40[^2]. as such, this had a self-sabotage cascaded all the way down into present materialistic and mechanistic perception.

well, likewise, I *do* believe that in a previous timeline I *was* successful. the rising kuldalini during star-watching and during solar outbursts, proves that my eye was nearly opened. I'm not interested in causing a conflict though. I'll willingly step aside and ensure that the powers present in today's society have as much capacity as they need to ensure nobody's eyes get opened. in fact, it's my goal that we all retain poor eyesight. more on that but first we need to talk about the dark lady and why she's so eye opening...

as I've been reading more and more about the "dark lady" sonnets, I couldn't figure it out because I thought that she would have dark skin, but when when reading them, I kept thinking it was the queen elizabeth after watching @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTV0k33YKN8&list=PLIe_MWXIGGHRsJo2tsg2nIGD31OudT1q1&index=2), I'm certain that the dark lady is the "virgin" queen without an heir. I understood it when he said that the hamlet story is the story of osiris. osiris was the one that built khemit/khambodia, etc. ham is the she black colour, and all over the place, the female bloodline that contained this bloodline bas represented with the colour black (like the black madonna). it's a bloodline colour, not a skin colour.

supposedly that bloodline -- which almost certainly is the same bloodline as the virgin mary -- so therefore *was* the maternal bloodline of jesus -- gives very expanded astral vision (say what you want, but I think it was probably jesus that expanded the visual capabilities of mary's bloodline, not necessarily mary). anyway, to access that, there are various breathing techniques to open that up, but supposedly sex is one of the most energetic ways to get that kundalini energy to rise (probably with proper bloodline matches). vere was very likely engaging in sexual activity with the queen for this purpose (see below sonnet evidence), and that's what gave him his expanded vision.

I don't really know what happened to the rest of that bloodline, but when elizabeth ended the tudor dynasty, I believe that vere passed on that expanded visual capacity through the initiations in these secret societies. I believe there's a resaon why the masons and all of the major orders consolidated on 6/24 1717 (I mean, how plain can you get) all the while this 30y war is raging across europe.

what it looks to me like what happened is vere took the expanded vision that previously was controlled using bloodlines and made it available to intiates in these secret orders to work their way toward. *that* is what really happened. that's the whole point of the self-sabotage. if he had've became king, that bloodline-only access would still remain today.

imagine a world where a new atlantis is created and once again there is a powerful ruling class and earth has good conditions again (garden of eden scenario), and still few people hold all of the power, so that continued interbreeding is necessary to maintain that status quo. eventually, you come to a point where things degenerate so far, that a destruction of the new atlantis is once again imminent. so, looking at your creation -- the new atlantis, you think: well, it's an enormous failure because it's succeptible to corruption within small groups of power -- so you decide to go back and alter the timeline so that major power structures (like the church) are stripped of some of their power (reformation) and the knowledge of the opening of the eyes is encoded and available to find for those wanting to find it (held in the secret societies).

---

my commentary on that whole debacle is that nobody can make decisions for anyone else -- for even if I said, "the world needs to do things "the right way" -- that right way is no different than a monarch passing an edict mandating that things go a certain way. there is no way to forcibly make anyone decide that they want something good, so really the only way to get what's wanted is to stop the fight -- or maybe start to enjoy the fight.

you'll notice that ever since shakespere, conflict has gotten increasingly more enjoyable. competition in the form of games have become less and less violent. I think of it something more like a martial arts fight or even a choreographed fight in a film -- where it's more artistic and stylistic than gory and gruesome. we're starting to enjoy conflicting over our differences much more. sport has helped this tremendously, even if global competition is still extremely political and is run usually with an agenda in mind -- but it's still better than it was.

eventually, it'll happen (and I think "aquarius" is the symbol of it), that true freedom is not in a power structure, but in individual empowerment. we'll have structures, but the ones that seek to hold on to power will, by nature be slower and less effective than individuals in harmony with each other. disharmony can never be more productive than harmony -- and I'm pretty sure there's a law about that somewhere. and also, eventually the power structures are going to become uninteresting to people -- like why settle for less, when the harmonious option exists?

---

OK, back on track here... I want to continue the discussion where I left it back when I was talking about how I believe that it's important for those like me to have poor eyesight, rather than good eyesight. I now refer to S148. there's a lot in this sonnet, so I'll break it down line by line:

    OMe ! what eyes hath loue put in my head,

OHM is the sound that you make to open up your eyes, however here, he's saying that it was "love" that put the eyes in his head. I take this to mean the tantric path rather than the sound, breath, and focus (individual) path.

    Which haue no correſpondence with true ſight,

he's setting up this idea of "true sight" -- and this to me is talking about something than just having one's eyes opened with "love" (reference to S153, S154). this is a setup for the finale.

    Or if they haue,where is my iudgement fled,

or, if my eyes (being opened) have correspondence with true sight, then why did I lose my judgment (ie see good from evil)?

he's looking at her with love's eye, and sees all that beauty, but underneith it, she has flaws.

    That cenſures falſely what they ſee aright ?

this is the reference to the illusion of physical beauty. IME, once my eyes were opened (by star-watching), everything is much more vivid, colourful, and vibrant. no matter how beautiful everything looks, he's not seeing things for how they really are ("true ſight")

    If that be faire whereon my falſe eyes dote,
    What meanes the world to ſay it is not ſo?

on the exterior, she's a babe, but inside, she's not quite so faire. if he were to come out with it, how does that affect the world? (she's the virgin queen, remember)

    If it be not,then loue doth well denote,
    Loues eye is not ſo true as all mens:no,

again, saying that the tantric opening of his mind's eye (love's eye - 4d) may not be as "true" as men's eyesight who can see the flaws not visible on the astral. (supposedly, by nature men's eyesight is not very good. we see a flat 3d screen, however after proper activation of love's eyesight, he can learn to see an extra spatial dimension (4d) like a woman does)

    How can it ? O how can loues eye be true,
    That is ſo vext with watching and with teares?

doesn't make sense how love's eye can be so "true" (in the geometric sense) but so unable to see at all in the conceptual/emotional sense. the constant reference to eyesight being "true" is likely a geometric reference, as "true" means like square, 90(degrees) -- straight, honourable.

    No maruaile then though I miſtake my view,
    The ſunne it ſelfe ſees not, till heauen cleeres.

the picture that it evokes for me is the "mist" that was put in early man's eyes so that he sees not clearly such a distance. your mind's eye radiates outward like a sun, but it can't see through the clouds. to explain this, I need to explain aura's and how I believe that the eyes "sees". in short, it receives data, and that data is a reflection of the light that your mind's eye is emitting, so when that eye is opened, the clouds are cleared and you can see everything clear as day, even in absolute darkness. this interacts with the heart and the genitals (love's eye) to produce the aura which is what gives the geometry that extra dimension.

      O cunning loue,with teares thou keepſt me blinde,

he thought that that love (with the black madonna) was opening his eyes, however, as I've stated numerous times previous, it's emotion that keeps us tuned away from the constant stream of revelation from your source (ie out of alignment because you don't feel good). obviously it was his perception that she was something super special (necessary) that was causing him this discord. he was in the need end of the desire spectrum, rather than the "I AM" end. sucks to be him, though.

      Leaſt eyes well ſeeing thy foule faults ſhould finde.

the modern translation renders "least" as lest -- but it's done intentionally because hme put his words in latin order (verb at the end)... "least well-seeing eyes, should find your faults" -- so, in otherwords, he's saying that by having lesser well-seeing eyes, her faults become redily apparent.

he's clearly not talking about physical perception here. in this sonnet he gives three forms of sight:

- mens sight
- love's eye
- true sight

he's saying that if I go back down to men's sight, then I won't be blinded to your faults with your magnificent aura and vibrancy in (4d) love's eye.

ever notice how your new lover always looks extra vibrant for a short period of time after meeting them, until you start noticing their faults? weird, huh?

what he really wants, is what he referred to in the beginning of the sonnet: "true sight" -- which I believe is 5d, and I believe that vere did accomplish it too -- however, it took him a while, and he had to give up kingship to get it -- which is how he's continued to influence things even after vere's physical body passed away.

---

OK, now, contrast that with matthew 5:28:

    But I say vnto you, That whosoeuer looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adulterie with her already in his heart.

this verse is saying the same thing, but the opposite direction. notice how it's saying that action made in the imagination is the same as having done it real life?

also, now notice that love's eye (imagination) is in the head, but adultry is committed with the genitals? what's in the middle? the heart. the heart is what produces the aura around your body to give everything that extra dimension. there is an inseperable link between the genitals, the eyes, the pineal and the heart. the heart is what gives you that true vision.

the heart is important because between the pineal and the heart is the throat (ie what you say), and between the genitals and the heart is the solar plexus (sun's energy centre). the moon for me is linked to the throat (action, will, structure, purpose), while the sun for me is linked to the stomach (instinct, intuition, gut feeling, emotion).

if you're going to activate sexually, the solar plexus 1-5 path is the way to go -- however, if you're going to go the lunar path, I recommend the breath (OHM) and focus path.

in short, I think that verse was a much longer explanation of the connectedness of the genitals, heart, eyes and imagination. this got greatly simplified to to try and make people feel bad for looking at a girl lustfully, when I believe he was trying to show that actions made in the mind are functionally the same as performing them in real life. your basic building block of LOA.

---

OK, so that went into a bit more detail that I originally intended to get into...

I have a tremendous advantage on this subject because they abosolutely do not want to ever allow me to have love's eye opened. I prefer it that way. I enjoy "true sight" much more.

after writing this, I think I'm going to have to take a deep dive into S153, S154 now (also love's eye and fire there too)

[1]: I have some thoughts on jupiter and the sun which I'll write about elsewhere, but it was a resonance because I just finished watching a japanese metal band called jupiter and his name is apollo (sun) -- in da vinci's diagram, jupiter and the sun have a 100:1 relationship with each other. some of the wheat will produce 30 fold, 60 fold and some 100 fold.

[2]: rich may be a reference to penelope rich
