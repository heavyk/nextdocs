### general sense I get leading to my interpretation

I justg got done reading the first 17 sonnets and it feels to me like I see them entirely differently. in the sections below, I'll put down how I see the sonnets, and like in the [venus and adonis](/shakespere/venus-and-adonis.md) I'll make some assumptions, most notably that it seems like he is transcribing, translating, or putting into verse something that he's receiving from "Time" (saturn). I beleve he sees himself as a young and beautiful version of saturn/demuzi/nergal, which he refers to in that poem as "adonis".

I will also make the assumption that he's writing to me (kenny) personally in the poems.

the general sense that I get is that Time really wants me to have children, but I simply refuse to do so, and so the pleading continues on for a while, but it's to no avail because all of his desire is rooted in deterioration and decay. in various sonnets he talks about renewing my outward appearance with beautfiful maidens and all sorts of stuff like that, urging me to establish an earthly house (bloodline).

somethings apparently go wrong, which is told in the 16th when he says, 

    Neither in inward worth nor outward faire
    Can make you liue your ſelfe in eies of men
    
and so it seems that I choose inner beauty rather than outward beauty, and this prevents the eyes of men to see me. the only way this is possible is if I do what I'm presently in the process of doing, which is going straight to 5d. 5d means I project downward into astral, meaning (probably, not 100% sure) that earthly/physical eyes won't be able to see me, just like most people can't see UFOs. only those with astral will be able to see me.

there's another thing that seems to imply that I have to leave or go another place (sonnet 9):

    Looke what an vnthrift in the world doth ſpend
    Shifts but his place,for ſtill the world inioyes it

and this part (sonnet 12):

    That thou among the waſtes of time muſt goe,

so it seems that I never end up with physical issue. additionally, there is idea that there is astral issue though, and the 17th sonnet states, "Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces."

inbetween there is this whole section on eugenics and sealed children. it sounds to me like something straight out of revelations 8 with a lot of people dying, but the ones that are "sealed" don't get hurt. so it sounds to me like they're using my bodies, and that they are somehow "me" now -- because I've lost "selfe" so it appears we've become a collective...

    O That you were your ſelfe,but loue you are
    No longer yours,then you your ſelfe here liue

remember, these are the sealed ones, the 144k virgin boys that have not been defiled by women (sonnet 12):

    Since ſweets and beauties do them-ſelues forſake,

these guys, (like me) seem to be 5d/4d astral entities. I'm described as never having had anything other than painted counterfits (sonnet 16):

    And many maiden gardens yet vnſet,
    With vertuous wiſh would beare your liuing flowers,
    Much liker then your painted counterfeit:

these painted counterfeits are likely the exterior image that nosebook gives to their astral bodies for people (without astral vision) to see and be able to interact with them.

every time that I refuse to have earthly children, I'm presented with a death and winter wasteland (which is exactly the opposite the extreme summer sun and heat in venus and adonis for his refusal to venus), so I don't think this is describing earth. I take this to mean gaga, the planet described in lbe as being ejected from saturn which became pluto (and I believe remnants of tiamat/jeortau is charon). this is a pretty cool setup if the moon is osiris (+-6-+), cause it makes a perfect triad compliment to the sun (-2) and a perfect environment for the many sealed thoths (the surveyors of the "new earth").

it's described in sonnet 17 as a barren desert and a sort of tomb (with wording that sounds a lot like the great pyramid), but I'd like to tie all of this together because gaga/pluto is the moon that exits saturn and becomes pluto, so if the "wastes of time" is pluto, then it makes a lot of sense the poetic resonance with a description of the great pyramid because the sirians pair thoth with saturn and venus (ie venus and adonis). I've talked a little bit about the 7th ray and the 1st ray triads elsewhere, but this is important: the mars thing also fits the description of the barren desert too, and I believe the referece to vere writing as if he's adonis+aries is precisely the combination that was necessary to produce the 7th/1st ray male of allayandra+anatau.

what all of this means is that it though I don't go for earthly issue, what does end up happening is multiple 7th ray females (genxicat prototype) and many 7th ray males (thoth prototype) become possible with the setup.

### 2022-07-05 03:27 - another look at the garden

[edit: nothing really new here. originally I had an idea that involved a lot more of the garden of eden symbolism: eating, eyes, death, shame (I guess + a few more) which I noticed and I had an interesting way of presenting it as backwards from the garden of eden story. however when I sat down to write it, the original thought left me and I ended up kinda repeating myself. I originally had it in blahblog as well, and it's probably where it belongs because I was essentially rethinking the second half of @[blahblog](2022-07-04 18:06)]

I was laying down thinking about it and there's this parallel with the sonnets and also the garden of eden. again, see the previous section for why I believe he's writing to me personally.

vere is writing as the "I am that I am" (ie YHVH). the interesting thing is that the garden of eden has various names for "God" (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/K_x03O1-MHI?t=3196)) and the one that is discouraging adam and eve from eating from the fruit is YHVH.

OK, now in the @[sonnets](sonnet-11), he essentially says that once you reach 40yo, you'll surely die -- just like YHVH said to the woman in the garden, he's also saying, to me?

in the garden of eden, YHVH is saying that if they eat, then their eyes will be opened. eyes are a very common theme in the sonnets (at least the first 17 of them) and the very first one talks about the eyes in the opposite way:

    But thou contracted to thine owne bright eyes,
    Feed'ſt thy lights flame with ſelfe ſubſtantiall fewell,

apparently, this guy's eyes are already quite bright, and have a flame that's fed with self-substantial fuel -- quite the opposite of the garden of eden. this time, it sounds like YHVH wants an heir so that "thereby beauties Roſe might neuer die" (ie. so that the rosicrucians secret society never dies? -- that's how the verse appears to me anyway)

randall just casts some doubt on the idea of YHVH being the infinite creator of the universe, but it seems pretty clear that YHVH is just one of the elohim (gods) there and is the primary opposition to the opening of the eyes of adam and eve. he wants them to remain in paradise -- so then paradise may not have been everything it was made out to be. after they eat from the fruit, then he gets very pissed off and sends them away from the garden -- then drives them out and makes sure they can never return to the garden.

personally, I believe this "garden" is something like the pre-motor cortex (the reptile brain) where everything is nearly instant reaction -- so something like mesmerism or the hypnotic state. it's also the state that channelers go into to translate vibration into something physical like words or sound.

if I look at it as a continuum, the garden is direct access to the conceptual plane of perception. however, most of the time we're not really conscious when we perceive from that plane. for example, this happens every time you sleep and also it's the state that channelers get into. deep hypnotism, especially mesmerism seems to act on this plane and since it's so far out of our realm of consciousness, we don't usually know much of what's happening or remember it. therefore, the tree of knowledge of good and bad seems to me to be something that enables the retention of consciousness in this state of mind.

adam and eve were probably not conscious in that state and only took symbolic orders and commands much like a person under hypnotism. that's the most likely reason that YHVH would want them to stay in the garden, but then after having gained "consciousness" (ie knowledge of good and bad, so the ability to make a decision instead of just taking commands), then now he does NOT want them getting back into that state because if in that state they find the other hemisphere (some call it the right brain), then suddenly everything becomes effortless and they become a physical manifestation of their own perception -- immortal.

so that's what I'm in the process of attaining right now. there's no real stopping me. it's just time and releasing resistance until there isn't anything that can keep me away from feeling that good.

---

essentially what I'm seeing here is that vere is writing this from the future looking back trying to say, "hey dude, make sure to have an heir before you go fully conceptual" -- and I think this is a refrence to the whole bloodline of jesus thing, where supposedly his bloodline has some pretty cool capacities. I don't think I'm from the jesus bloodline though, so everything that I've done to modify my DNA, I've done with my own perception and wasn't something I was born with.

just the same as YHVH telling them they'll surely die, I doubt I'll actually die -- and if I do, that's totally fine with me because I don't think it'll be a problem to get back into the physical pretty easily.

however, in the context that the serpent is the kundalini and most likely related to sex, it appears to be the exact reverse. vere is suggesting that I go to make an heir, which is exactly the way to cause lots of death and destruction. I'll wait until I'm completely non-resistant and then I'll go up naturally.

all in all, I think it's quite a disastrous idea to do the whole thing of trying to make an heir. so this whole narrative seems to me to play out like this...

I become sexually involved before I'm connected and it may retard my progress toward the conceptual for a while but eventually I'll get it and the serpent will strike again (I'm referring to rev 12). michael and his angels will cast down fire and stones at the earth and then humans will have to start over again. it's a good thing they've gotten my heirs though so that they can continue on in the new bloodline and reset the humans back.

I'm not very interested in that, and it's funny reading this because I almost get the sense that not having a cataclysm is *worse* than having one. they need to reset the population and get genetic upgrades and it seems like they're going to go to any effort to get it.

I'm not that concerned about my genetic material being out there as I'm pretty sure there is quite a lot of it. who knows how many shapeshifters and other things are out there either from jesus' bloodline or from my own, but that's not what I'm aiming to avoid. what I'm looking to do, is to *not* have the kundalini rise -- which is why I'm staying away from star-watching and sex (and other things). I figure they'll eventually figure out a way to "trick" me into having sex and producing an heir, but I posit that'll happen in the future and a split will take place when they figure that out.

if I get connected, lots of other people will get connected too, and that'll be what causes the catastrophe. if I want to go toward a reality that doesn't have a catastrophe, that's what I will go towards. they can get as many people they want to believe that a catastrophe is coming all they want and create their own reality (obviously not mine, hence the split) -- and that's totally fine.

---

on that note, I noticed some tremendous resistance (dad called and other things) when I was writing @[blahblog](2022-07-04 18:06), where you can probably feel the difference between before dad called and afterward. before he called I was trying to brainstorm some ideas that were opposite the narrative presented (IMO) in these sonnets, which is that I'm pushed toward producing an heir but that never happens, and so instead ... I think shortly I want to write out my own interpretation of it in full. it's going to take a fair bit of work, but it seems fun.

finally, I'm just not as clear as I normally am for some reason. I also don't really know how to express some of these ideas well.
