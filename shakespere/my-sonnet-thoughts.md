### general sense I get leading to my interpretation

I justg got done reading the first 17 sonnets and it feels to me like I see them entirely differently. in the sections below, I'll put down how I see the sonnets, and like in the [venus and adonis](/shakespere/venus-and-adonis.md) I'll make some assumptions, most notably that it seems like he is transcribing, translating, or putting into verse something that he's receiving from "Time" (saturn). I beleve he sees himself as a young and beautiful version of saturn/demuzi/nergal, which he refers to in that poem as "adonis".

I will also make the assumption that he's writing to me (kenny) personally in the poems.

the general sense that I get is that Time really wants me to have children, but I simply refuse to do so, and so the pleading continues on for a while, but it's to no avail because all of his desire is rooted in deterioration and decay. in various sonnets he talks about renewing my outward appearance with beautfiful maidens and all sorts of stuff like that, urging me to establish an earthly house (bloodline).

somethings apparently go wrong, which is told in the 16th when he says, 

    Neither in inward worth nor outward faire
    Can make you liue your ſelfe in eies of men
    
and so it seems that I choose inner beauty rather than outward beauty, and this prevents the eyes of men to see me. the only way this is possible is if I do what I'm presently in the process of doing, which is going straight to 5d. 5d means I project downward into astral, meaning (probably, not 100% sure) that earthly/physical eyes won't be able to see me, just like most people can't see UFOs. only those with astral will be able to see me.

there's another thing that seems to imply that I have to leave or go another place (sonnet 9):

    Looke what an vnthrift in the world doth ſpend
    Shifts but his place,for ſtill the world inioyes it

and this part (sonnet 12):

    That thou among the waſtes of time muſt goe,

so it seems that I never end up with physical issue. additionally, there is idea that there is astral issue though, and the 17th sonnet states, "Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces."

inbetween there is this whole section on eugenics and sealed children. it sounds to me like something straight out of revelations 8 with a lot of people dying, but the ones that are "sealed" don't get hurt. so it sounds to me like they're using my bodies, and that they are somehow "me" now -- because I've lost "selfe" so it appears we've become a collective...

    O That you were your ſelfe,but loue you are
    No longer yours,then you your ſelfe here liue

remember, these are the sealed ones, the 144k virgin boys that have not been defiled by women (sonnet 12):

    Since ſweets and beauties do them-ſelues forſake,

these guys, (like me) seem to be 5d/4d astral entities. I'm described as never having had anything other than painted counterfits (sonnet 16):

    And many maiden gardens yet vnſet,
    With vertuous wiſh would beare your liuing flowers,
    Much liker then your painted counterfeit:

these painted counterfeits are likely the exterior image that nosebook gives to their astral bodies for people (without astral vision) to see and be able to interact with them.

every time that I refuse to have earthly children, I'm presented with a death and winter wasteland (which is exactly the opposite the extreme summer sun and heat in venus and adonis for his refusal to venus), so I don't think this is describing earth. I take this to mean gaga, the planet described in lbe as being ejected from saturn which became pluto (and I believe remnants of tiamat/jeortau is charon). this is a pretty cool setup if the moon is osiris (+-6-+), cause it makes a perfect triad compliment to the sun (-2) and a perfect environment for the many sealed thoths (the surveyors of the "new earth").

it's described in sonnet 17 as a barren desert and a sort of tomb (with wording that sounds a lot like the great pyramid), but I'd like to tie all of this together because gaga/pluto is the moon that exits saturn and becomes pluto, so if the "wastes of time" is pluto, then it makes a lot of sense the poetic resonance with a description of the great pyramid because the sirians pair thoth with saturn and venus (ie venus and adonis). I've talked a little bit about the 7th ray and the 1st ray triads elsewhere, but this is important: the mars thing also fits the description of the barren desert too, and I believe the referece to vere writing as if he's adonis+aries is precisely the combination that was necessary to produce the 7th/1st ray male of allayandra+anatau.

what all of this means is that it though I don't go for earthly issue, what does end up happening is multiple 7th ray females (genxicat prototype) and many 7th ray males (thoth prototype) become possible with the setup.
