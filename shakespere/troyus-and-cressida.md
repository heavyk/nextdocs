# troyus-and-cressida

- nestor:
  - sees 1000 hectors on the field
- cassandra:
  - wants trojans/romans to lend her 10000 eyes so she can fill them with prophetic tears
  - equates paris with cupid (fire-brand brother)
- ulysees:
  - one guy figures out how to go the straight path (hEro), but then emulating that yields a thousand (2nd ray) suns (honour travels a straight so narrow where *one* but goes a breast, keep then the path: for *emulation* hath a thousand sonnes)
- diomedes:
  - 1000 years and in my *emulating* honor aeneas can finally die.
