### 2023-02-12 15:17 - random notes from the dedications


9:48 - lots of gemini stuff:

"fauors being received from your L.L" -> "from your 11.11"
"TO THE MOST NOBLE AND INCOMPARABLE PAIRE OF BRETHREN" -- incomparable = very different, and pair is two, like gemini.

(btw, you can get higher resolution images of the first folio here: https://open.library.ubc.ca/viewer/shakespe/1.0421801#p20z-2r0f:)

there are a lot of really interesting things to see in that dedication. I'll transcribe it below:

```
WHilſt we ſtudie to be thankful in our particular,for
the many fauors we have received from your L.L
we are the falne_, vpon the ill forture , to mingle_,
two of the moſt diuerſe things that can bee, feare,
and raſhneſſe ; raſhneſſe in the enterprize, and
feare of the ſucceſſe  For,when we valew the places your H.H.
ſuſtaine,we cannot but know their dignity greater,then to deſend to
the reading of theſe trifles:and,vvhile we name them tifles,we haue
depriu'd our ſelus of the defence of our Dedication. But ſince your
L.L. have beene pleas'd to thnke theſe trifles ſome-thing,heereto-
fore;and haue proſequuted both of them, and their Authour liuing,
vvith ſo muh fauour : we hope,that(the out-liuing him,and he not
hauing the fate,common with some,to be exequutor to his owne wri-
tings)you will uſe the like indulgence toward them_,,you haue done
                                  A  2                         vnto

vnto their parent. I here is a great difference,vvhether any Booke
chooſe his Patrones, or finde them_,: I his hath done both.  For,
ſo much were_, your L.L. likings of the_, ſeuer all parts,  vvhen
they were acted,as before they vvere publiſhed,the Volume ask'd to
be yours.  We haue but collected them_,, and done an office to the
dead,to procure his  Ophanes,  Guardians ; vvithout ambition ci-
ther of ſelfe-profit, or fame: oneley to keepe the memory of ſo worthy
a Friend,& Fellow aliue,as was our S H A K E S P E A R E,by hum-
ble offer of his playes,to your moſt noble_, patronage.  W herein, as
we haue iuſtly obserued, no man to come neere your L.L. but vvith
a kind of religious addreeſſe_,;it hath bin the height of our care, vvho
are the Preſenters,to make the preſent worthy of your H.H. by the
perfection.But,there we muſt alſo caue our abilities to be conſiderd,
my Lords. We cannot go beyond our owne powers.   Country hands
reache foorth milke,creame, fruites, or what they have : and many
Nations(we haue heard)that had not gummes & incenſe,obtai-
ned their reueſts with a leauened Cake. It vvas no fault to approach
their Gods, by what meanes the could: And the most,  though
meaneſt,of things are made more precious,when  they are dedicated
to Temples. In that name therefore, we moſt humbly conſecrate_, to
your  H. H. these_, remains of your ſervant Shakeſpeare ; that
what delight is in them_,   may be euer your L.L. the_, reputation
his,& the faults ours,if any be committed,by a payre_,ſo carefull to
ſhew their gratitude both tto the liuing, and to the dead, as is




                                Your Lordſhippes moſt bounrden,

                                             IOHN HEMINEGE.
                                            HENRY C O N DE LL.
```

I have no character for the swoopie at the end of "e_," and "m_,", so I use "_," to fill the space.

"I here" looks like a "There" but it's clearly "ay, here is a great difference"
"Nations(we haue heard)" is a very large "N" (4 characters worth)
"And the most,  " is also a really large "A" (clearly it's trying to push the line down for Temples. and H.H. dots triangle)

first LL is L.L
second is H.H.
third is L.L.
fourth is L.L. (however, notice the first dot is much smaller than the second dot)
