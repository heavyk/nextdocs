# shakespere notes - venus and adonis

### general stuff

venus wants adonis to save her

there is a resonance with the sumerian story of gilgamesh using ishtar's previous lovers as a reason for not hooking up with her and adonis/dumuzi/tammuz was one of them. they're all dead.

venus doesn't think she's very beautiful -- or at least she thinks that adonis is 3x more beautiful than she is, anyway.

there's also this weird part where venus says that she subdued mars, the god of war and got him to learn "sport and dance, To toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest" -- inotherwords, like the prostitute did to enkidu, venus did to mars. 

### venus and adonis conversation

I'm really having trouble with the conversation because I can't tell who's talking. it's especially notable in the third paragraph.

    “Thus he that overrul’d I oversway’d,
    Leading him prisoner in a red rose chain:
    Strong-temper’d steel his stronger strength obey’d,
    Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.                112
      Oh be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,
      For mast’ring her that foil’d the god of fight.

supposedly this is adonis saying this section, so why is he saying, "don't be proud, and brag of your might, for mastering venus, the one that defeated the god of fight"

who is he talking to?? he's telling venus to not be proud for mastering venus, the one capable of taking down the god of war.

that's like telling myself, "kenny don't be proud or boast about mastering kenny the one that did something awesome" ... so, surely he's not talking to venus.

#### a bit on venus

venus is a weird enitity in the stories because the sirians have her (as unessa) paired with saturn and thoth. they go out of their way to note that she's paired with a very ugly god. in this one she's a (-3) and paired with thoth (+7) and saturn (+-4).

mars/allayandra, accordiing to the sirians is also a +7, so this is a pairing of 3-7, but with saturn as a ground it seems to do OK.

then, there is the legend that this poem is probably referring to, of hepaestus/vulcan who's husband was venus and she was caught in a net with mars. vulcan was also said to be the husband of venus and he had a club foot and limped (again ugly). according to the sirians, vulcan was paired with genxicat and mars, so in this case, it appears that venus is now a -7, and mars is also a +7.

then, there's the legend of venus being ishtar, which get confused a lot in the stories with anatau (-1).

the only primary layer of perception that venus hasn't played yet is the conceptual one like vulcan (-5+).

so what this tells me is that mars is looking for venus to be a -1, which is what the sirians say is, if anatau/sekhmet/venus and allayandra/mars are together (ie their two I's be single), mars becomes a 1st ray male.

I believe that venus in this story is the one of the -3 type and not the -1 type, because she operates on him with structure (words, logic and predicting the future, paths, etc).

the other interesting thing to note is that adonis is this strange god because here he's beautiful, but adonis would be dumuzi/tammuz for the sumerians -- so, saturn -- but a beautiful saturn. that fit with the -3 venus as well.

#### who is he talking to?

when I first started to read this dialogue, I was very confused because I read it all as adonis (de vere) saying all of that, because for some reason I just assumed that it was something like me, where I've basically got the equivalent of venus on the inside of me, so I was thinking that maybe vere had mars on the inside of him and he (vere) was the one that taught mars to dance, sport, toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest.

then, the part where it was saying, "don't be proud, and brag of your might, for mastering venus, the one that defeated the god of fight" -- it felt like he was talking to me.

I don't really know how to explain that sensation but let's just say that I totally did figure out how to master venus, even the one that took down the god of the fight -- well, to me it wasn't all that hard. I just learned to follow desire instead of structure.

I had to learn how to be 5-1 instead of 3-7. 3-7 would be the relationship that mars had with venus (in the context of tammuz/saturn), and that means that the symbols that venus outputs will become reality, which is totally a fine thing, but up until now adonis is feeling shame, feeling pity for venus (she's crying), feeling anger and sullenness. so whatever symbols venus has, no matter how wonderful and lusty sounding they are, the way that he feels means that she's going to amplify the way he feels tremendously and turn that feeling into reality.

this is why I take it from the 5-1 perspective because the way I'm feeling is going to determine the outcome no matter what the symbols are. venus could come up with the worst possible symbols and if I'm conceptualising it in a way that's feels fine, I'll still pull out of it just fine. I know that no matter what I can pull out of anything fine if I approach it from a emotional/conceptual perspective.

so I don't really know how the story is going here, but it feels to me like adonis/vere is saying all of this. since saturn (Time) was said to be a pretty old and not very attractive god, I take it that vere is kind of writing a bit of a personally relevant but symbolic retake on "Time" (saturn) a youthful guy. further confirmation of the adonis+mars is the constant white+red symblism. red is mars and the white is vere/adonis.

#### the conversation

this conversation is still so weird to me that it feels like code, so I'm going to try and decipher it from the perspective that this story is adonis (young and beautiful saturn) and he has mars inside of him (adonis+mars). next, I'll assume that when he says "you" he'll be referring to kenny+venus.

let's see how it goes... 

    “I have been woo’d as I entreat thee now,
    Even by the stern and direful god of war,
    Whose sinewy neck in battle ne’er did bow,
    Who conquers where he comes in every jar;             100
      Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,
      And begg’d for that which thou unask’d shalt have.

mars has been his captive and slave, and it's mars that's begged for what I (kenny) will eventually have eventually have (venus) even though I didn't ask for it.

    “Over my altars hath he hung his lance,
    His batter’d shield, his uncontrolled crest,          104
    And for my sake hath learn’d to sport and dance,
    To toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest;
      Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red
      Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.         108

mars, sharing a body with vere/adonis had to learn sport and dance. then, he was taught by vere/adonis how to have fun (to toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest). he learned how to use his arms (probably as if they were his own) -- but "Making my arms his field, his tent my bed." also gives me the image that mars battlefield (fight) was his arms and his rest was in vere's bed.

    “Thus he that overrul’d I oversway’d,
    Leading him prisoner in a red rose chain:
    Strong-temper’d steel his stronger strength obey’d,
    Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.                112
      Oh be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,
      For mast’ring her that foil’d the god of fight.

everruled is the one with the most power (mars), vere swayed him into a different thing, leading mars as a prisoner into a "red rose chain" -- resicrucians?

    “Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine,
    Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red,        116
    The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine:
    What see’st thou in the ground? hold up thy head,
      Look in mine eyeballs, there thy beauty lies;
      Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?     120

it feels to me like there's this weird thing where again he says that his lips are not so fair (white?) but they are red -- and this is emphasised because it's rhymed with head -- and I don't know why he would be telling me to look him in the eyes -- because *my* beauty lies in looking them in the eyes?

the eyes in eyes thing reminded me of nosebook. 

    “Art thou asham’d to kiss? then wink again,
    And I will wink; so shall the day seem night.
    Love keeps his revels where there are but twain;
    Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight,          124
      These blue-vein’d violets whereon we lean
      Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.

let's say he's asking if I (kenny) am ashamed to kiss them, so he says he'll wink and then because the day seeming like night sounds like a pretty good thing in the context of the sonnets where there is so much heat it's unbearable. isn't that a good thing? he winks and the heat goes away. I'm not sure I understand. what is the winking? I looked around for other examples of winking and it seems to be some sort of sleep. sonnet 43 is the most similar to this one in various aspects, most notably the conclusion: "All days are nights to see till I see thee, And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me."

so here's an idea... imagine that the only way that adonis+mars ever gets to show up is during the night -- as in, when I'm sleeping and so the only view is through nosebook, so when in the previous parapraph, the command to look in adonis' eyeballs, must mean that the way to see through adonis' eyes is to kiss ... him?

"be bold to play, [and] our sport is not in [eye]sight" -- (probably in because of the next section) is the ability to perceive astral.

the conclusion has this *we* which would be venus and adonis but I took it originally as the shakespere group talking about the blue-blooded (monarchy) violets (royalty) whereon *we* depend, can never say anything or know what *we* mean.

in this modern interpretation (as if he's talking to me), I'll say that's probably referring to nosebook because they can't ever blab and they always have to know what we mean (it is true that nosebook is always trying to figure out everything I'm thinking about and stuff)...

I don't fully understand right now, but I'm going to keep going.

    “The tender spring upon thy tempting lip             127
    Shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted,
    Make use of time, let not advantage slip;
    Beauty within itself should not be wasted,
      Fair flowers that are not gather’d in their prime
      Rot, and consume themselves in little time.         132

the unripe part is probably a reference to the first sonnet. the conclusion is saying that we don't pick plants (fruits, flowers, etc) when they're at their prime/peak, but they're still unripe.

wierd synchro, I said that mom should leave the strawberries longer because she's picking them while they're unripe. personally, I like to pick the fruit when it's at it's prime and then eat it then because it's most sweetest. before that, it's often tart and sour to the taste. I suppose flowers are different. you want to pick them when they're young because they're just beautfiul decorations and you want maximum time before they wither and rot. I think in this context he's equating girls and beauty to flowers.

I'm not really very hip on this type of thinking. I see where the popular idea -- that girls need to be picked up and used up while they're young so as to not let their beauty go to waste -- comes from, but I don't see things this way at all. I believe that beauty is a reflection of what's on the inside, and mr shakespere here is all deterioration and decay as a function of time.

    “Were I hard-favour’d, foul, or wrinkled old,
    Ill-nurtur’d, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,
    O’erworn, despised, rheumatic, and cold,
    Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice,      136
      Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee;
      But having no defects, why dost abhor me?

I don't abhor anyone for their physical beauty. I think it's a reflection of the way they conceptualise reality. children conceptualise reality in a different way than adults do so their physical bodies have few defects. my goal is to become as a child, while maintaining the mental capacity of an adult. I believe that once I'm "perfected" (see fuzzing-time-pickles), I'll be able to take on any form I desire in any (compatible) point of time. people will perceive me the way they conceptualise me to be. to be [conceptualised] or not to be [conceptualised]? (that is the question). I prefer to let people see whatever they want to see when they look at me. it's the ultimate beauty.

    “Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow,           139
    Mine eyes are grey and bright, and quick in turning;
    My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow,
    My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning,
      My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,
      Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.       144

cool story bro.

    “Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,
    Or like a fairy, trip upon the green,
    Or like a nymph, with long dishevell’d hair,
    Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen.         148
      Love is a spirit all compact of fire,
      Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.

 "     "    "

    “Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie:           151
    These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;
    Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,
    From morn till night, even where I list to sport me.
      Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be
      That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee?       156

 "     "    "

    “Is thine own heart to thine own face affected?
    Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?
    Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected,
    Steal thine own freedom, and complain on theft.      160
      Narcissus so himself himself forsook,
      And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.

lol, you got me. I'm totally vain and self-centred. this whole thing (most notably the first sonnet) just feels like a giant thing that's saying, "if I don't give in to [insert whatever here] then I'll die"

but what if I *want* to die? or, at least, what if I'm not concerned about dieing? I don't have any concern at all if I go up in flames and it all goes away because I know that won't happen. it can't happen because it's all attraction.

    “Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,
    Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,         164
    Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear;
    Things growing to themselves are growth’s abuse,
      Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breedeth beauty;
      Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.            168

that's relatively close to what I'm saying when I say it's all attraction. a seed attracts the resources it needs to become a tree, and so likewise I attract the same resources to become what I will become. there's no need to "use" fresh beauty, as there is infinite amounts of it. there is unlimited abundance.

    “Upon the earth’s increase why shouldst thou feed,
    Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?
    By law of nature thou art bound to breed,
    That thine may live when thou thyself art dead;      172
      And so in spite of death thou dost survive,
      In that thy likeness still is left alive.”

it'll happen. as there's more desire for it, and it's attracted, it'll happen. again this really feels like the "need to preserve something that's dying or deteriorating" sort of perspective that's pervasive in ancient texts and other things of an "antique pen".

if I don't breed, I'm breaking the law... I guess there are a lot of gay men out there that are breaking the law. also, what in the world is up with all of this preserving a memory (sonnet 1) and likeness stuff.. it's really annoying. I'm pretty well sold that a "species" is just a physical DNA manifestation of the way a concept perceives reality. that "concept" is the "solar angel" (soul), so there will inevitably be infinite versions of me -- just tune into that concept. DNA doesn't make the concept, the concept makes the DNA.

#### next thing
